"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE," A pesar de que cada aÃ±o su audiencia es mÃ¡s baja, los premios de la Academia de Artes y Ciencias CinematogrÃ¡ficas (conocidos popularmente como los Premios Ãscar) siguen marcando el final de la temporada de premios dentro de la industria del cine, cuyo inicio estÃ¡ marcado por las nominaciones a los Globos de Oro. Entre diciembre de un aÃ±o y marzo del siguiente, la prensa, los crÃ­ticos, los integrantes de la industria cinematogrÃ¡fica y el pÃºblico comienzan a debatir sobre las mejores pelÃ­culas del aÃ±o. Algo tan absurdo como divertido. Absurdo porque, en la mayorÃ­a de los casos, el hecho de que una pelÃ­cula llegue a estar nominada puede ser proporcional a la cantidad de dinero que distribuidores y productores invierten en campaÃ±as casi mÃ¡s propagandÃ­sticas que publicitarias. De cara a la temporada que cierra meses mÃ¡s tarde con los Ãscar, los estudios y las casas productoras comienzan a empapelar Los Ãngeles y hacer pÃºblicas sus campaÃ±as de for your consideration âpara su consideraciÃ³nâ. En estas se llega a incluir las categorÃ­as a las que la pelÃ­cula âmereceâ estar nominada. Con el fin de llamar la atenciÃ³n de los votantes que nominarÃ¡n y, finalmente, premiarÃ¡n a una serie de pelÃ­culas cuyos nombres tienden a repetirse a medida que las ceremonias avanzan. Sin embargo, a pesar de lo absurdas, polÃ©micas o manipuladas que puedan ser ciertas premiaciones, no dejan de ser una fiesta del cine muy divertida de ver, donde los âgrandesâ de la industria se aplauden a sÃ­ mismos mientras aprovechan el escenario y el galardÃ³n como plataforma para dar discursos polÃ­ticos o ideolÃ³gicos. En los Ãºltimos aÃ±os han mencionado el empoderamiento femenino, el calentamiento global, el racismo y hasta la inseminaciÃ³n artificial de vacas, cuando Joaquin Phoenix recibiÃ³ su premio al mejor actor por su papel en Joker (2019). Y entre lo espectacular âen el sentido mÃ¡s literal de la palabraâ de estas premiaciones, lo bochornosas que pueden llegar a ser y esa innata necesidad del ser humano por tomar partido por un bando u otro, estas transmisiones, con sus alfombras rojas, famosos vestidos de gala y segundos de tensiÃ³n antes de la revelaciÃ³n de los ganadores, se vuelven algo casi que obligatorio de mirar para cualquier persona apasionada por el cine. Por las modalidades y criterios de selecciÃ³n, ciertas tendencias histÃ³ricas o, simplemente, por no contar con suficiente poder econÃ³mico para sustentar una gran campaÃ±a, a muchas pelÃ­culas no les llega la invitaciÃ³n a la gran fiesta de la Academia de Hollywood, que se llevarÃ¡ a cabo este domingo 12 de marzo en el Dolby Theatre de Los Ãngeles. Y como esta falta de exposiciÃ³n puede llevar a que algunas grandes pelÃ­culas sufran una falta de interÃ©s, o incluso de conciencia sobre su existencia, presentamos una lista de cinco pelÃ­culas que no cuentan con ninguna nominaciÃ³n a los Premios Ãscar pero que realmente vale la pena ver. Robert Eggers forma parte de una nueva generaciÃ³n de directores, junto con Ari Aster (Hereditary, Midsommar) y Jordan Peele (Get Out, Us, Nope), que pisan fuerte en el cine de terror actual; ese terror que popularmente se ha empezado a considerar elevated horror. Ese tÃ©rmino hace referencia a que se trata de pelÃ­culas de terror pero con un contenido subtextual mÃ¡s complejo o intelectual. Eggers saltÃ³ a la fama con The Witch (2015), protagonizada por âuna todavÃ­a no famosaâ Anya Taylor-Joy, y se consagrÃ³ con The Lighthouse (2019), que interpretaron Robert Pattinson y Willem Dafoe. El hombre del norte (como se estrenÃ³ localmente), se aleja por completo de las estructuras minimalistas y perturbadoras de Eggers y da paso a su primera megaproducciÃ³n, que aunque fue muy bien recibida, tanto por la crÃ­tica como por el pÃºblico, fue un fracaso en taquilla: no superÃ³ su presupuesto. Uno altÃ­simo, como era de esperarse para una pelÃ­cula cuyo elenco incluye a Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd, Anya Taylor-Joy (con salario actualizado), Nicole Kidman, BjÃ¶rk, Ethan Hawke y Willem Dafoe. Bajo el mantra âte vengarÃ©, padre. Te salvarÃ©, madre. Te matarÃ©, FjÃ¶lnirâ, el prÃ­ncipe Amleth emprende un viaje de venganza que se adapta de una leyenda medieval escandinava, que fue ni mÃ¡s ni menos la que le dio existencia al Hamlet de Shakespeare siglos mÃ¡s tarde. Ni la tragedia ni Eggers escatiman en violencia, gritos, sudor, sangre y espadas, junto con una puesta en escena ambiciosa, una de las mejores fotografÃ­as y una de las bandas sonoras mÃ¡s Ã©picas del aÃ±o, brindan un relato que, incluso si sabemos a dÃ³nde va a llegar, es tan atractivo como difÃ­cil de ver. El trabajo de Eggers hasta ahora ha sido ignorado por los Ãscar, algo que parece importarle poco a Ã©l y a sus colegas de El faro, quienes no han dudado en mostrar sus pocas pulgas al mejor estilo Dibu MartÃ­nez en varias oportunidades. The Northman estÃ¡ disponible para ver en HBO Max. Una de las mayores sorpresas al anunciarse la lista de nominados a mejor pelÃ­cula internacional para la 95.Âª ediciÃ³n de los Premios Ãscar, fue la ausencia de la nueva pelÃ­cula del coreano Park Chan-wook. El director de la âtrilogÃ­a de la venganzaâ, principalmente conocido por Oldboy (2003), tiene como marca autoral el tratamiento de la violencia en toda su filmografÃ­a. Decision to leave no es la excepciÃ³n a esto, pero con sutileza. El montaje va mucho mÃ¡s allÃ¡ del simple acto de cortar y pegar; las actuaciones son de primer nivel. El director asiÃ¡tico logra hacer una pelÃ­cula mucho mÃ¡s violenta que las anteriores a travÃ©s de la construcciÃ³n de una relaciÃ³n sumamente tÃ³xica entre un detective que se enamora de su principal sospechosa. Decision to leave es una pelÃ­cula policial de misterio, pero con tintes de romance que hacen que el argumento se vuelva cada vez mÃ¡s complejo. A medida que la pelÃ­cula avanza, se vuelve admirable cÃ³mo Park Chan-wook afirma que, a veces, la violencia se expresa de diferentes formas. En este caso, no serÃ¡n ni las armas, ni la sangre, ni las grandes secuencias de combate, sino el amor, que teÃ±irÃ¡ de rojo sangre las retinas de los espectadores a pesar de no explicitarlo en pantalla, algo que parece homenajear y actualizar a la tambiÃ©n coreana y tÃ©trica Hanyo (o La criada, de 1960, dirigida por Kim Ki- young). Esta es una pelÃ­cula ideal para aquellos apasionados por los giros de tuerca trabajados con sutileza y que no dejan de sorprender. La pelÃ­cula tenÃ­a proyectado su estreno en salas de cine de Uruguay, pero fue cancelado (posiblemente apostando a que la gente solo la verÃ­a si estaba nominada a los Ãscarâ¦). Actualmente estÃ¡ disponible en internet vÃ­a pay per view y posiblemente sea estrenada en alguna plataforma en los prÃ³ximos meses. Quien diga que Adam Sandler no es un buen actor y no merece ser reconocido como tal, es por que no ha visto su trabajo en Punch-Drunk, Love, de Paul Thomas Anderson, o Uncunt Gems, de los hermanos Safdie. Tampoco su Ãºltima pelÃ­cula, Hustle, sobre un exbasquetbolista y actual cazatalentos que se propone convertir en estrella a un jugador de bÃ¡squetbol que encontrÃ³ por casualidad en un partido callejero en EspaÃ±a. Garra, tÃ­tulo en espaÃ±ol, es posiblemente la mÃ¡s popular de esta lista dado que su estreno fue en Netflix, y es, sin dudas, la mÃ¡s amigable de todas. Una clÃ¡sica pelÃ­cula donde el deporte y alcanzar el Ã©xito sirve como metÃ¡fora para la superaciÃ³n, construcciÃ³n y reconstrucciÃ³n personal. Pero la nueva pelÃ­cula de Sandler no se queda solo con eso, sino que cuenta la historia de un veterano frustrado que harÃ¡ lo que tenga que hacer para cumplir sus sueÃ±os proyectÃ¡ndolos en alguien mÃ¡s. Con un increÃ­ble despliegue deportivo, porque la protagonizan estrellas del basquetbol de la NBA; una combinaciÃ³n ideal de drama y humor; y una sensaciÃ³n de calidez que se transmite en cada momento. Es una pelÃ­cula ideal para pasar un buen rato y hasta para ver en familia. Este animÃ© (animaciÃ³n japonesa) no fue formalmente excluido de los premios de la academia de este aÃ±o, sino de los del aÃ±o pasado, dado que su estreno y postulaciÃ³n para el mercado estadounidense fue en 2021 y no en 2022. Sin embargo, llegÃ³ a salas de cine latinoamericanas, y posteriormente a Netflix, en 2022. Se llevÃ³ el premio a la mejor pelÃ­cula animada del aÃ±o por parte de la AsociaciÃ³n de CrÃ­ticos de Cine del Uruguay (ACCU) en diciembre del aÃ±o pasado. La historia de Belle es una nueva adaptaciÃ³n del clÃ¡sico La bella y la bestia, pero extrapolado al mundo moderno e isekai (subgÃ©nero de fantasÃ­a japonesa), en el que los personajes viven sus aventuras en un mundo de fantasÃ­a, en este caso, a travÃ©s de un juego de rol al mejor estilo Second Life, un gÃ©nero cuyo director ya manejaba con soltura por haber trabajado en varias entregas de la franquicia de animÃ© Digimon. En esta actualizaciÃ³n del cuento francÃ©s, Suzu, la protagonista, es una joven introvertida que logra volverse una estrella anÃ³nima con su avatar en un mundo digital, que es un hÃ­brido entre los juegos de rol de realidad inmersiva y las redes sociales. Dentro de este mundo, Suzu conocerÃ¡ al DragÃ³n (la bestia) con quien inmediatamente generarÃ¡ un vÃ­nculo muy fuerte, pero Hosoda se encargarÃ¡ de darle un giro inesperado para traer el cuento clÃ¡sico al mundo moderno, exponiendo todo lo que puede haber detrÃ¡s de un simple avatar en una red social. La pelÃ­cula se encuentra disponible en Netflix. Si Hustle era la mÃ¡s conocida de esta selecciÃ³n, esta pelÃ­cula danesa es probablemente la mÃ¡s difÃ­cil de encontrar. Original de la plataforma Shudder (no disponible en Uruguay), Speak no evil es una pelÃ­cula de horror que juega, a su vez, con la sÃ¡tira para llevarnos a lugares oscuros de los que difÃ­cilmente podamos salir sin algÃºn tipo de secuela. Perturbadora, es una pelÃ­cula que cada vez que se la vuelva a ver, mÃ¡s detalles se encuentran. La prensa es simple: una familia danesa es invitada a pasar un fin de semana en la casa de unos holandeses que conocieron en un viaje a Italia. El filme construye la tensiÃ³n y el horror desde sus primeros minutos y no mÃ¡s de dos escenas. Al director, Christian Tafdrup, no le hace falta mÃ¡s que una banda sonora sumamente indicativa y una secuencia de montaje que roza lo intelectual para contarnos todo lo que pasarÃ¡ en la pelÃ­cula en menos de cinco minutos. Pero lejos de ser una desventaja para nuestra atenciÃ³n como espectadores, la pelÃ­cula sabe exactamente quÃ© hacer para, incluso sabiendo a donde iremos, adentrarnos cada vez mÃ¡s en lo oscuro de su universo. Sus personajes tienden a tomar las peores decisiones, lo que generarÃ¡ una frustraciÃ³n que el espectador cargarÃ¡ a lo largo de la pelÃ­cula. AsÃ­, darÃ¡ situaciones incÃ³modas una atrÃ¡s de la otra y, ademÃ¡s, todas giran en torno a la misma idea: la ingenuidad y lo polÃ­ticamente correcto, asÃ­ como la pasividad que esto acarrea y las consecuencias a las que puede llegar. Esta limitada selecciÃ³n es solo una muestra de que, por mÃ¡s atractivo que sea sintonizar la transmisiÃ³n de los Premios Ãscar este domingo 12 de marzo, tambiÃ©n es altamente recomendable explorar opciones que estÃ©n por fuera del radar de las ceremonias de premios, ya que podremos encontrarnos con opciones variadas para todos los gustos y que, muchas veces, dejamos pasar por no contar con un reconocimiento bastante frÃ­o y arbitrario.

"Oct 31, 2023",POSITIVE," Partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late. A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible. Low 67F. Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph. Now, I’m not one to brag, but when I was younger I hobnobbed with a Hollywood celebrity and her family. Her name was Cheryl, and she lived on the opposite side of our cul-de-sac in a Tyrone area neighborhood in St. Petersburg. I knew her before her big-screen debut, and I am happy to say that her newfound fame did not change her one bit. Cheryl landed a part in the 1978 film “The Norseman,” which was filmed right here in the Tampa Bay area. This low-budget American International Pictures cast Lee Majors — still riding high on the success of his television show “The Six Million Dollar Man” — as an 11th-century Viking prince who travels to the shores of North America in search of his missing father. Being a 10-year-old kid, all I knew was Cheryl was in a movie with Lee Majors. In my mind, this meant she must be the female lead and the hero’s love interest. Of course, Cheryl was an extra — one of dozens, if not hundreds. The production company had put out a call for anyone in the area with Native American heritage. Didn’t matter: She was still a star, even if I couldn’t find her on screen when my parents took me to see “The Norseman” at Tyrone Square Mall. I thought about Cheryl when I read visionary writer-director Robert Eggers was filming “The Northman.” Although both epic historical dramas revolve around Vikings, the two films are as different as night and day. Where “The Norseman” feels like a formula swashbuckler with a heavy ’70s vibe and little attention to historical detail, “The Northman” is rooted in history and inspired by literature and legends. Eggers — known for blurring the line between reality and fantastical dreamscapes — creates a kaleidoscopic spectacle of hallucinatory imagery and blood-spattered brutality. The director’s two previous films — “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — both earned high praise from critics. “The Northman” was released April 22 in theaters. The film opens in the year 895 A.D. with young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak), son of King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), joining in festivities to welcome home his father from some overseas campaign. Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) is notably less enthusiastic about the king’s return.  Though still wounded from his conquests, the king summons his son to take part in a rite of passage to prove his worthiness as heir to the throne. Immediately following the ceremony, Amleth sees his father murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Though Fjölnir orders his men to kill the king’s heir, Amleth escapes and vows to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. Yes, of course this sounds familiar. Amleth is a figure in a medieval Scandinavian legend. He serves as the direct inspiration of Prince Hamlet in Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.  “The Northman” jumps forward a few years, with an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) living among a band of Vikings and fighting alongside them as a berserker. Following a raid on a village in the land of the Rus on the Baltic Sea, Amleth encounters the Seeress (Björk), who reminds him of his oath of vengeance and foretells elements of his destiny. He also discovers Fjölnir fled to Iceland after he was overthrown by Harald of Norway.  No need to elaborate on how this revenge saga plays out, other than to say it’s brutal, bloody, and occasionally unhinged. Eggers serves up this timeless tale with as much pomp and circumstance as panache and savagery. It feels simultaneously archetypical and innovative. Beyond its connection to Scandinavian legend, the film draws from various literary and cinematic sources. A sequence in which Amleth recovers a prophesied sword brings to mind a similar scene from John Milius’ 1982 film “Conan the Barbarian,” which itself was likely based upon the 1967 story “The Thing in the Crypt” by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, using Robert E. Howard’s character Conan. As usual, Eggers goes to extraordinary lengths to achieve a level of historical accuracy in “The Northman.” He also imbues the film with mysticism and religious conviction, emphasizing the importance of divinity among these characters. Eggers makes it clear that their gods are not just vague, impersonal figures in a sprawling pantheon — they are ubiquitous and accessible, and they are part of the very fabric of life.  “I thought Vikings were violent, hulking brutes with nothing of interest,” the director says in the film’s production notes. “My wife, on the other hand, had been fond of the Icelandic Sagas, the esteemed medieval stories of Viking lore, and she knew that I would love them. But even at her insistence, I never opened one of these great books.” “I immediately imagined solitary tenth century figures on horseback, dwarfed by supernaturally colored mountains, glaciers, and infinite skies,” he said. “There was something about the elements, and the elemental that cried out from the landscapes.” Working with archeologists and historians, Eggers sought to recreate the minutiae of the physical world, while also attempting to portray the inner world of the Viking mind, including their beliefs, mythology, and ritual life.  In that sense, “The Northman” is an unequivocal success. It is steeped in history and legend, dripping with eeriness and barbarity, and it echoes Arthurian and Shakespearian motifs. Filled with stunning cinematography, the film is an intense, immersive, sometimes surreal, descent into an otherworldly milieu of folkloric horror and medieval barbarism.  How mainstream audiences will react to “The Northman” depends upon their willingness to embrace Eggers’ distinct visual style and brooding tone. Despite its epic scope, the film retains an arthouse ambiance and — beyond the revenge theme at its heart — examines the toll of cyclic violence as well as man’s enduring inhumanity. If that sort of thing appeals to you, catch it while it’s in the theaters for the ultimate experience: You’re likely to wince more than once as if the blood and mud might fly off the screen and hit you in the face."
"Sep 17, 2023",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers has stated that in making The Northman, he hoped to achieve the ultimate Viking Epic. Although it is difficult to say whether he has succeeded, what remains true of the film is that it is indeed epic in every possible sense — a visually spectacular feast that grips the audience from its opening moments until the arresting finale. Coming out of an impressive run with two smaller budget films, 2015’s The Witch and 2019’s The Lighthouse, Eggers is given a 90 million USD budget to expand his idiosyncratic world-building into an indelible and violent film that remains recognizable to his arthouse style yet is given the breadth to bring that vision to a mainstream audience. The story comes from Norse legend. Amleth is a tale that became the boilerplate for ‘Hamlet,’ but Eggers and multi-hyphenate talent Sjón have changed elements of the story drastically. In the original versions, Amleth, after witnessing the slaying of his father, feigns being a fool to later enact revenge on his uncle, who has usurped the kingdom. Eggers and Sjón have done away with the fool Amleth and have replaced him with a hardened warrior consumed by revenge. Arguably as the story plays out, Amleth’s quest for revenge does seem foolish as the cost is unfathomably high and his drive to destroy his uncle is a kind of madness that is ruinous to him. The year is 895 AD, and Amleth (played as a boy by Oscar Novak) is a young King in training. His father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), has returned from battle with his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth and his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), greet the wounded but triumphant warrior. In Amleth’s eyes, his father is a hero and righteous King who brings glory to the people. Furthermore, Aurvandil is an attentive and loving father who is preparing Amleth’s succession to the throne. Eggers takes us through some of Amleth’s rites of passage, including a psychedelic encounter with Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe), where they ingest hallucinogens and throw off their humanity to see the manifest destiny of their family line. Stylistically, this scene is very much in Eggers’ playbook — the reality and unreality exist at once. For Aurvandil and Amleth, the magic is not metaphor; they believe in their Gods and the forces of the supernatural. Soon after Aurvandil’s return, Amleth witnesses the treacherous attack of his uncle Fjölnir, who, with a band of loyal men, brutally dispatch Aurvandil and hunt down and try to kill Amleth. Almeth witnesses the coup and sees Fjölnir take his mother, Gudrún, as his new queen. Escaping the kingdom, Amleth vows that he will avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir. Years pass, and Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) is a muscular Berserker living in the land of Rus. Amleth’s humanity has all but disappeared, and he is a killing machine. Eggers spares the audience little as he takes us through long shots of the Vikings destroying villages and collecting slaves. Skarsgård is an imposing presence both physically and because he is violence personified. Blood and mud-soaked, he fills the frame with menace. In a sacked village, Amleth encounters a Seeress (played by Björk in her first speaking role in a film since Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark) who reminds him of his oath to destroy Fjölnir and restore his family line. She warns him that the revenge will come at a cost, and he will have to sacrifice his kindness and kin. Soon thereafter, he hears that the slaves the Berserkers have captured are destined for Fjölnir, who has lost his kingdom and is rebuilding his community in Iceland. Amleth brands himself a slave and is taken in shackles to the new land. Fellow captured slave Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) takes an interest in Amleth as she can see that he is not a sheep but something more. To eventually escape her captors, Olga claims she will use her mind which is as powerful a weapon as Amleth’s brawn. The two become lovers and co-conspirators in Fjölnir’s downfall. Amleth’s quest for revenge teeters between realism and a fever dream. Eggers spins us in and out of reality in a style so clearly his own. The larger budget allows for sheer magnificence as he takes us through the kingdoms. Vistas are sweeping and glorious. Yet, despite this, they don’t really add to the narrative heft of the film. Ironically, it is the scenes filmed in close quarters that are the most impressive. Eggers excels at the surreal and otherworldly, but this comes mainly through the script. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, The Lighthouse (2019), manages to capture both extremes of Eggers’ vision. Still, it is those moments where the camera is close to the action that are more distinctly discombobulating and fascinating. Alexander Skarsgård, The Legend of Tarzan (2016), is quite simply a magnificent beast in the film. Amleth, given reason to reclaim his humanity through his love for Olga, becomes more complex and nuanced than the man who lives only through violence and hatred. Although Skarsgård’s performance is predominantly physical, there is space for him to portray the character’s grief, betrayal, confusion, and vulnerability. Nicole Kidman as Gudrún is given one of the most effective scenes in the film. Gudrún’s steel is unexpected, and Kidman, once again, proves that even with a supporting role, she is built to surprise and impress. Sadly, Anya Taylor-Joy isn’t given as much meat as one would hope for the ostensible lead actress. Her accent, unplaceable and confusing, often lifts the audience out of the diegetic world. Perhaps it is because Olga is essentially an adjunct to Amleth and a means for him to question his quest and devotion to violence that she seems somewhat underwritten. Taylor-Joy has proven many times in her relatively short career (essentially kickstarted by Eggers in The Witch) that she is a profoundly compelling presence. Whilst she is on screen, it is difficult to look away from her, but as one contemplates Olga, the less the character seems to exist for anything but another rite-of-passage for Amleth. As a bloody and most certainly trippy revenge tale, The Northman is astounding in many places. Eggers may not have created the ultimate Viking tale, but he has crafted an astonishing spectacle that combines his established style with something larger. The film is indeed epic in scope and scale. However, it feels its most authentic when it is obviously Eggers. The myth and magic at the heart of the tale are more interesting than the revenge narrative. Eggers also seems somewhat forgiving of the brutality of Viking culture. Amleth is our hero, and because of what befell him, his violence seems justified. Eggers does end on a nihilistic note that then transforms into a reward for Amleth’s bloody vengeance. To an extent, Eggers’ films are open to many interpretations, and The Northman is no exception. However, as a visual experience, it is marvelous even if it isn’t as thematically rich as his previous works. Strap in for a wild and violent ride and let Eggers engulf your senses."
"Aug 16, 2023",POSITIVE," Despite Covid, we finally got back to the movies the way we knew them, as evidenced by “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” buzzing and flooding the box office. There were fewer masks, ID checks or sit-in-every-other-seat stipulations, but streaming did make clear inroads on how we see entertainment. Of the 10 films the Day selected for our Top Films of 2022, two (“Decision to Leave” and “RRR”) played exclusively on the small screen; three are Non-English-language; three had limited releases (“Emily the Criminal,” “God’s Country” and “Fire of Love”) and can now be found on streaming platforms, but resonated enough with the Day’s critics to make the list; and there is one documentary. A diverse list of must-sees. The latest from Korean director Park Chan-wook (“Oldboy,” “The Handmaiden”) is a dark crime drama in which the lives of a police detective and murder suspect intersect and fold in on each other. It’s a psychological thriller that has Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) looking into the curious death of a skilled rock climber who fell despite safety measures. Gathering the mountainside evidence makes for an interesting process, with a second detective strapped to Hae-jun’s back as they rope walk up the sheer surface. Suspicion falls on the wife, Seo-rae (Tang Wei), a Chinese immigrant who’s not quite fluent in Korean – did I mention that her departed husband was an immigration official? Hae-jun is a hands-on profiler sort and in scenes when observing Seo-rae, he’s suddenly in the room, a ghost to her, observing her. It’s a neat device Park throws at us that blurs the lines between reality and projection. It’s also a reflection of Hae-jun’s detached demeanor; he’s an insomniac, and has a strangely dysfunctional sex life with his wife. Natch, Hae-jun and Seo-rae have an attraction to each other that hangs dank and ripe in every scene they’re in. In the second part of the hypnotic slow burn, both have relocated to the same new city where Seo-rae is married to a fund manager and works as a caregiver to the old. It’s here that the film moves into darker territory, as Seo-rae is visited by a disgruntled client of her husband who slaps her around (the character is actually named Slappy) and there’s another death that cannot be misconstrued an accident or suicide. Of course Hae-jun is the one assigned the case. How Park lays down the cards does have reveals, but it’s mostly a deeply internal reckoning by Hae-jun. The film feels a bit like a true-crime noir and would make a perfect double bill with countryman Bong Joon Ho’s “Memories of Murder” (2003), about Korea’s first true documented serial killer. (Tom Meek) On Mubi. Besides a deep emotional journey, the revelation of Davy Chou’s “Return to Seoul” is the phenomenal debut performance by Ji-Min Park as Freddie, a 25-year-old adoptee who travels from her home in France to Seoul, South Korea, in reluctant search of her biological parents. Energized and hypnotic, with scenes of Freddie letting loose and dancing alone center stage at a bar (a best-dance-scene-ever candidate) or a tense family meal broken by translations and clear misunderstandings, it’s the palpable undercurrent of rage communicated by Park that links it all together. Adrift in a world where she is of two (and many more) parts and struggling to assimilate as a Korean-born transplant who speaks fluent French, some English and a modicum of Korean – but by norms is expected to behave within Korean custom and genuflection when there – her story is a familiar one for many, but set apart. An aching open wound, “Return to Seoul” begs the question of where we find our identity, how much of it is shaped by where we grow up and with whom, and the power of the perception of others. (Ally Johnson) Not in theaters or online. Todd Field’s first film in 15 years following “Little Children” likely could not have come into existence without its star, Cate Blanchett, who delivers a turn so bravura, lived-in and essential that it may just be the most defining performance of a highly accomplished career that already has notched two Oscars (“Blue Jasmine” and “The Aviator”). Her Lydia Tár, the commanding maestro of the Berlin Philharmonic, is a barrier breaker and even more so, a breaker of souls. Lydia has a wife and daughter – she’s a self labeled “U-Haul lesbian” – and also manipulative, often cruel, if not abusive, and an opportunist fostering and engaging in several inappropriate relations with young aspiring female musicians and conductors. Field’s provocative flip is of a woman behaving as entitled and above the law as many a miscreant called out and cut down via the #MeToo movement. The astute use of sound, both atmospheric and Lydia’s keen perception of it, gives the film an aurally immersive texture that deepens the moral contemplation. Let’s hope it’s not another 15 year for Field’s next potential magnum opus. Read a full review from Oct 13. (Tom Meek) Available for purchase online. As heartbreaking as it is hilarious, “The Banshees of Inisherin” is a tremendous deconstruction of what happens to the human condition when the hands on the clock begin to move rapid. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”), the film and its stars revel in the filmmaker’s taste for the macabre. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson play lifelong friends whose relationship is suddenly severed by Gleeson’s Colm with little to no reasoning. A meditation on the necessity of art and escaping life’s mundanities in contrast to the simplicity of enjoying our time together just for the sake of it rather than pushing forward, it’s paradoxically hopeless as it is life-affirming by the film’s end. Farrell delivers career-best work with Gleeson, Kerry Condon, and Barry Keoghan all excellent as well. Read a full review from Oct. 28. (Ally Johnson) On HBO Max. Jersey-accented Emily (Aubrey Plaza, recently seen in the second season of “The White Lotus”), an art school dropout with a criminal record, is stuck in gig-job purgatory and soaring student-loan debt. Tired of earning chump change and not realizing her dreams or making a livable wage, she dips her toe in the prosaic criminal underworld as a “dummy shopper,” using fake IDs and credit cards to buy expensive goods to sell on the black market. Emily flirts with her illicit mentor and fellow dreamer Youcef (Luke Cage’s Theo Rossi, playing to type as a man with a weakness for powerful, angry women) and turning misappropriation into her full-time job. The money is enticing, but danger mounts. Here Plaza finally gets to play a character that matches the distinctness of her simmering television role of April Ludgate on “Parks and Recreation.” John Patton Ford’s directorial debut is captivating as the threats to Emily’s well-being escalate from being called out for lying in an interview to physical harm. Plaza projects her character’s apprehension and channels it into moral outrage directed at her attackers as well as her physical and societal limitations. (Sarah Vincent) On Netflix. Sara Dosa’s documentary about renowned French volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft has tons of eye-popping footage of flowing rivers of boiling lava and bellowing volcanos. It’s “wow” with a capital W and ever mesmerizing, if not hypnotic, and you can easily get why the Kraffts became so obsessed with these earth-shaping phenoms. Of course there’s sudden danger that comes with storm-chasing volcanic eruptions, and the couple died in the 1991 eruption of Japan’s Mount Unzen. The film’s title is purposefully multilayered, referring to the couple’s love for one another as well as their unquenchable passion for all things hot, molten and flowing. Narrated by Miranda July with a warm but oddly flat and twee intonation, the film transforms the Kraffts’ vast ’87 archive into a world-hopping travelogue punctuated by eruptions and opulent rivers of red. In construct, “Fire of Love” calls to mind Werner Herzog’s “Grizzly Man” (2005), because there too an obsession with something massive and lethal threatens to become deadly in nearly every frame – and ultimately does. (Tom Meek) On Disney+. Viking Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) seeks to avenge his father’s death, rescue his mother, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman in a fearless, taboo-shattering performance) and reclaim his identity. His quest transforms him from being an animalistic killing machine to a man who sacrifices himself to break the cycle of violence for his future family and fight for the freedom of those he enslaved. For the project, Skarsgård nagged writer and director Robert Eggers to adapt an old Icelandic poem, an antecedent to Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” In the “gods’ war,” the characters are consenting shamanistic avatars for raven god Odin, fertility god Freyr and the Norns of Fate in the form of a seeress (Björk) rooting for Amleth’s unlikely ally, enslaved Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) with Amleth as a pawn to protect her queen. Eggers’ visual style is a roller coaster of primordial, oneiric imagery of an epic, wild landscape, turbulent supernatural forces and untamed nature sans any whiff of domestication.

The sublime, multitalented Michelle Yeoh (“Supercop,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), stars in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” as Evelyn, a middle-aged Chinese immigrant who discovers  around the Lunar New Year while juggling a tax audit, receiving a visit from a judgmental father and handling multiple family crises that she is the multiverse’s savior. Writers and directors The Daniels’ surreal feature blends sci-fi, action, horror and comedy without neglecting the story’s heart: finding meaning in life through love and kindness to others. The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters’ personalities than a drama could. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples’ potential and makes their internal lives literal. The immigrant, laundry lady and bureaucrat often appear in the margins of other films; The Daniels’ beautiful elevation of them honors these unsung pillars of society. They turned their moms and dads into flawed heroes, while the audit and the threat to the multiverse serve the same function of forcing Evelyn to assess her life and decide if she wants to stay the course, change or give up. It creates the possibility of redemption and renewal for her as an individual. By healing herself in this epic journey, she can heal generational trauma. Read the full review from March 31. (Sarah Vincent) At The Brattle Theatre, 40 Brattle St., Harvard Square, and on Showtime. S.S. Rajamouli’s three-hour-plus epic is a bold, outrageous spectacle, peppered with thrills, jaw-dropping stunt work, breakouts into Bollywood dance and a poke in the Western eye about the evils of colonialism. The Indian production takes place in the 1920s, when the country was under British rule. Our bigger-than-life heroes come in the form of Raju (the highly charismatic Ram Charan Teja), an Indian soldier under British command, and Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), a can-do villager and mechanic whose daughter has been abducted by the British governor (Ray Stevenson). The governor’s so hyperbolically nefarious they could have just called him Snidely Whiplash and been done with it, and his wife (Alison Doody) is nearly as nasty; at one point she supplies a torturer with a barbed whip. We meet each protagonist separately, each performing Herculean feats: Raju battling through a throng of hundreds, who hammer and pound him, to apprehend a suspect; Bheem outrunning a wolf and, bare-chested, shouting down a tiger. (The CGI is pretty low budget, but it hardly matters.) Later the two team up to save a boy above a flaming river, but even later in the epic run time find themselves at odds because of Raju’s allegiance and Bheem’s ceaseless quest to regain his daughter from Raju’s higher-up. “RRR” (for “Rise, Roar, Revolt”) is astonishingly energetic from start to finish, tongue-in-cheek craziness that sometimes strains but never breaks the wild turning and dropping ride. (Tom Meek) On Netflix. Professor Sandra Guidry (Thandiwe Newton, “Crash”) lives in a wide-open, snowcapped mountainous wilderness of Montana and works in the warm halls of civilized academia. After two hunters use her property without permission, she leaves a note on the windshield of their pickup truck; when they keep coming back, she refuses to back down despite the physical disparity and looming threat they pose. Julian Higgins’ neo-Western turns the trope of the lone stranger not looking for trouble on its head in unexpected, beautiful and tragic ways. Guidry rejects cynicism and is compelled to confront and change the things she cannot accept, but that list grows as the movie unfolds. Like most women in Westerns, she cries out for civilization: “We all gotta play by the same rules if this is gonna work.” Because of a lack of resources, weak character or corruption, authority figures fail to heed her cry for justice. Once Guidry’s past is revealed, she is no damsel in distress, but remains grappling with frustration over her inability to protect others. This is an unpredictable, majestic visual feast, sparse with dialogue and rife with superb performances, and Higgins’ sophomore feature is a strong contender for best American film of the year.

"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE,Robert Eggers has crafted one for the ages&#8230; The Northman  is a cinematic epic that blew my mind from start to finish&#46; Lavishing cinematography that brings to life this era&#44; visceral violence that adds to the world&#44; &amp; a jaw dropping third act
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE," To know director Robert Eggers is to know a remarkable master of light, sound, and storytelling all wrapped up in a single film. 2019’s The Lighthouse broke rules when it came to how a simple story could turn into a visual stunner for the senses. With Eggers’s latest, The Northman, the American director takes audiences through a forgotten time of valkyries, vikings, and revenge…which is definitely a dish served very very cold.  The Northman stars Alexander Skarsgard as Amleth, a viking prince on a journey to avenge his father’s death and save his mother from the hands of his evil uncle. Sound familiar? It should, as it is the same basic plot of Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Disney’s The Lion King. Similarities aside, The Northman proves to be a standalone film that is a cut above the rest. We start with a young Amleth in 895 AD, traversing his life in the North Atlantic with his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Their kingdom is a snow covered wonderland, where the King is always tasked with the ungodly chore of battling others to keep his family and kingdom safe. Unfortunately for the King, the true evil comes from within his own family, as his only brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), plots against him to take over the kingdom. While witnessing the death of his father at the hands of his uncle in a torturous ambush, young Amleth flees his homeland uttering his creed to himself, “I will avenge you father, I will save you mother, I will kill you Fjolnir.” We cut to a much older, and hot as fuck, Amleth, who is a true viking in an animalistic society where he helps to destroy towns and take others as his prisoner. Fit and full of rage, Amleth is the definition of strength on the outside, while wrestling with demons of hate on the inside. Still intending to follow through with his promise to his father and mother, Amleth hears rumors of his uncle’s whereabouts, and sets off on a plan to finally take what is rightfully his.  Boarding a slave ship as a stowaway, Amleth meets the incredibly beautiful Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who agrees to become his most trusted ally throughout his quest. As the slave ship docks in Iceland, Amleth quickly discovers his uncle and mother, as well as their two children, have taken over this new land as they were dethrowned by others in Amleth’s original kingdom. Disguising himself as a slave and unrecognizable in his older years, he attempts to gain the trust of his uncle, before he plans to wield a sword into his father’s killer. The Northman is an incredibly gifted film full of hostility, genealogy, strength, and desire. Alexander Skarsgard is picture perfect as Amleth, a man with one solitary vision for how his life should go, based upon the dreams of his father. Anya Taylor-Joy is ferociously talented as Amleth’s ally and love interest, while Claes Bang gives a truly horrifying performance as the main villain. The only drawback to the film’s success is Kidman’s casting, as it brings memories of when Angelina Jolie and Colin Farrell were cast as the mother/son duo in Alexander. Kidman and the twist in the middle of the film go hand in hand, but it would’ve been preferable to have cast an actress that didn’t just play Skarsgard’s battered wife in a famous series, Big Little Lies. Without giving away too much more, Eggers’s use of light, darkness, and stunning cinematography by Jarin Blaschke should be reason enough for anyone to see this film. "
"Jul 25, 2023",POSITIVE," Violent and powerful from start to finish, The Northman tells an epic, period accurate Viking tale that easily immerses its audience throughout the entire run-time. Directed by Robert Eggers, The Northman tells a story of revenge. When Price Amleth's father is brutally murdered by his uncle, Amleth seeks revenge years later when he is a strong, bloodthirsty Viking. He embarks on a journey to save his kidnapped mother, kill his uncle and avenge his father.  Viking tales are popular amongst regular movie goers and casual watchers alike, and luckily, The Northman's story excels. It is bloody, brutal and violent from the get-go, and isn't afraid to shock its audience. There is action aplenty to keep you invested, yet also a great amount of quieter moments that allow us to get to know our characters better with thorough development. We follow Amleth from a boy to a man, and are able to root for him regardless of his flaws and thirst for blood. It's a wild ride full of fighting, violence, death, revenge, love, witchcraft and even a couple of twists and turns along the way. It is likely to impress many. The movies most admirable aspect is undoubtedly its visuals. The cinematography is simply stunning from start to finish, with excellent attention to detail in regards to framing, use of lighting and colour. Each and every shot appears to be meticulously crafted, a trait that can always be found in an Eggers flick. It makes for a highly immersive experience, especially when paired with the enchanting original score from Sebastian Gainsborough. The costume and set design brings everything together harmoniously, creating a feast for the ears and eyes. It's artistic flair is commendable. With a cast this stacked, the amount of excellent performances was not a surprise. Nicole Kidman is a scene stealer as Queen Gudrun, mother of Amleth who was kidnapped by her late husbands brother. Though her screen-time is minimal, she packs a punch with her mesmerising performance. Anya Taylor-Joy excels as Olga of the Birch Forest, a slave who becomes a love interest for our lead, and exhibits so much emotion throughout her scenes. Claes Bang also impresses as villain Fjolnir the Brotherless, the target of our leads thirst for revenge. However, it is Alexander Skarsgard who shines the brightest in his lead role as Amleth. He exudes the strength and determination of his character, never letting the audience doubt his craft. He truly becomes Amleth, giving a career best performance. Other notable performances include those from Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke and Oscar Novak. Due to Eggers previous directorial work with 2015's The VVitch and 2019's The Lighthouse, it's safe to say he had a lot to live up to, The Northman making its way to many film fans 'Most Anticipated' lists. Though this is his first attempt at a blockbuster-esque movie that takes a break from the horror genre, his artistic flair runs through every scene and it is undeniably Eggers. He is known for his excellent visuals, tension building and unique story-telling, and though The Northman may be his most accessible to date, it stays true to all his best traits. Eggers has once again created a phenomenal movie that is a testament to his talent, and the edge away from horror shows he may have many more strings to his bow. He is without a doubt one of the most exciting film-makers working today. To summarise, The Northman is something special. It deserves to be seen on the big screen by as large an audience as possible. With its intriguing and engrossing storyline, phenomenal acting performances, gorgeous visuals and flawless directing, it is extremely difficult to find a fault. Its brutal and violent in the best way possible yet precisely artistically crafted, including something for blockbuster fans, Viking enthusiasts and those who enjoy the finer aspects of cinema."
"Jul 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,The Northman is a story that&#8217;s been told many times over&#44; and save for showcasing the stunning scenery of Ireland&#44; this adaptation is nothing to write home about&#46;
"Jul 21, 2023",POSITIVE," It’s the question that Robert Eggers’ The Northman contends with right from the start of his $90-million historical epic. Few directors can command the financial means to explore carnal and macabre depictions of Nordic mythology, let alone have the privilege of top-billed performers like Nicole Kidman mouthing Old English lines for the sake of historical accuracy. Fortunately for Eggers, the expressionistic period horror of The Witch and the transgressive eroticism of The Lighthouse have given him carte blanche to craft a high-octane adventure that puts other studio films to shame. An entirely different beast from his previous two films, The Northman isn’t trying to elevate horror nor dismantle fetishistic fantasies. It’s a fully-formed exercise in realigning blockbuster pictures back to the way they should be: big, visually breathtaking, and bolstered by a unique vision. “Broadly appealing” is less an insult towards the film but more towards its association with the homogenized cinematic climate it cuts through. It’s easy to interpret a lack of finesse when the story’s distant relative is Hamlet, and the action looks replicated from other tentpole setpieces (and even television, see Game of Thrones long-shots), but these evaluations overlook the attention to detail unique to this film, which is sorely lacking in committee-constructed films. In an attempt to strike a balance in said cinematic climate, Eggers mentioned that he had Gladiator and Braveheart in mind. He reportedly had to re-edit the final cut so as not to “require a master’s degree in Viking history” when watching. The result is a merging of two worlds: the slow and meticulous pace of arthouse films and the mind-numbing excess of mainstream action. It’s a well-rounded meal that everybody can chew on, making it liable to some lows but also some unimaginably high highs. Alexander Skarsgård plays Prince Amleth, son of King Aurvandill (played by Ethan Hawke) and heir to the kingdom’s throne. At a young age, he witnesses his father’s murder at the hands of Fjölnir (played by Claes Bang), the king’s brother. This prompts Amleth to flee from his home, pledging to exact revenge on the usurper, save his mother Gudrún (played by Nicole Kidman), and fulfill what was foretold to him by the king’s jester, Heimir (played by Willem Dafoe). In what feels like the film’s most overly-edited sequence, the initial set-up is surprisingly breezed through, leaving little room to linger on the above-stated characters. It isn’t a surprise that the following scene is a bloodbath filled with ambitious tracking shots and expert choreography. The action sequence is a microcosm of Jarin Blaschke’s ambitious cinematography and his ability to match the brooding atmosphere of the Icelandic legend. There are many flavors to the film’s milieu, sometimes dredged in greys and blues, and other times only lit by the orange emanating from the natural fire. It’s probably not contentious to say that this is a beautiful-looking film. Years later, as a berserker, Amleth finds himself ravaging towns along with fellow Vikings. He encounters Olga (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), one of the Slavic slaves occupying the land of the Rus. She offers an alternative life to the vengeful prince, a breath of normalcy, and a return to the ordinary world in hero’s journey terms. Besides that, Taylor-Joy offers little to the table and is relegated to her primal attributes of benevolence and mysticism, traits which are undoubtedly faithful to the legend but unsubstantiated for modern standards. Björk also returns after 17 years removed from acting to play a Seeress who prophesizes Amleth’s revenge in a brief yet eerie sequence.  The film’s highlight is Skarsgård’s forceful turn in the lead role, but an underrated aspect is the vulnerability he allows to feed into his performance. Amleth is a dirtied character, unflinching in the face of mud and blood and blinded by the viciousness of fate. Each guttural scream from him is accompanied by a contemplative search for purpose, a push and pull between a vengeful life and a free one. He decides to be chained as a means of confronting his now exiled uncle and witnessing the noble life snatched from him. One can palpably sense the longing and despair that has defined his adulthood. Skarsgård plays the part with the temerity of a ruthless wolf, but hiding underneath the headdress is a broken child who is alone in the world.  Sjón, an Icelandic novelist, joins Eggers in writing the script, which is every bit a play in the same way Joel Coen’s The Tragedy of Macbeth was — but on steroids. One of the creative liberties they took on for the Nordic story is the inclusion of a werewolf-inspired coming of age ritual inside a bleak cavern, and it plays out as bizarrely as it sounds. The in-world mythology has a serene, matter-of-fact quality to it, as though visions of arterial family trees and blue-eyed warriors riding horses to Valhalla were commonplace in this universe. It’s part of the script’s charm and, by extension, the visual language that translates it."
"Jul 21, 2023",NEGATIVE,"By the time the end credits hit, you will be waiting for it to begin anew, and that is one of the highest compliments you could give a movie of this size and breadth. "
"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE," Alexander Skarsgård leads a stellar cast in Robert Eggers’ latest, The Northman, which provides all the weirdness, gore, beauty and singularity that you would expect from this director’s take on a Viking tale of vengeance. It’s a classic Eggers equation, adding together (met) expectations of his stylised and violent version of an historic epic with rabid commitment from his actors, which certainly equals a movie with undeniable power – whether it’s to everyone’s tastes or not. On only his third feature-length film, following The Witch and The Lighthouse, it’s impressive that the writer and director already has a distinguishable-enough style that audiences can know what to expect and strap themselves in accordingly. However, for every horror fan that thrills at the (literal) gut-spilling and decapitation, as well as repeatedly bizarre religious rituals around bonfires, there are others less enraptured by his bold vision, which does have a tendency towards indulgence at moments. With young Viking prince Amleth (played ably by Oscar Novak before Skarsgård) at its heart, The Northman follows the youngster’s growth as he flees his home following the murder of his father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Powered by his own personal motto to avenge (his father’s death), save (his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman)) and kill (his treacherous uncle), Amleth returns years later to carry out his plan. The Northman’s great cast lives up to what you’d hope from such starry and suitably Scandinavian-heavy billing. Everyone has whole-heartedly embraced the intensity Eggers likes to draw out from his actors (sometimes it’s exhausting simply watching), even if it’s only little snippets of delightful bizarreness we’re treated to from Björk and Eggers returner Willem Dafoe. Claes Bang is a worthy adversary to Skarsgård, with the irresistible suave charm he had as Dracula for the BBC in 2020 replaced by steely aggression, while Nicole Kidman has a properly meaty role in which to sink her teeth. Anya Taylor-Joy also returns to an Eggers’ role, after leading 2015’s The Witch, once again lending her ethereal beauty and delicate touch to the part of tough-as-nails slave Olga. However, the film rests mainly, and comfortably, on Skarsgård’s massive shoulders. Dialling it up to what can only be described as beast mode for a fair chunk of the film, he has the physique, presence and (Swedish) pedigree for it, and we’ve seen him show off his brand of almost noble savagery before in spades in his international break-through role on vampire show True Blood. Although a more accessible film than The Lighthouse, sharing a similar ability with The Witch to ground itself in the history and faith of its setting, The Northman does lean heavily into its weird rituals and visions, alongside the dark violence of Viking gore, which is exactly where you’d expect to find Eggers. The Northman’s chuckles are few and far between due to its near-unrelenting grimness, although odd moments of light relief are peppered in – consider yourself warned if you don’t think you’ll be in the mood for a man having his freshly chopped-off head placed up his a**e.

"May 9, 2023",POSITIVE," In Matt Reeves’ The Batman, Robert Pattinson tries out “I’m vengeance” as The Caped Crusader’s latest cinematic catchphrase. In Robert Eggers’ The Northman, Alexander Skarsgård’s Prince Amleth takes it up a few notches, preparing himself in the style of Kill Bill’s Beatrix Kiddo and Gladiator’s Maximus Decimus Meridius for a roaring rampage of bloody, gladiatorial revenge on his nasty uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang, whose character is soon enough “Fjölnir the Brotherless”). Loosely inspired by the medieval Scandinavian legend that gave birth to William Shakespeare’s famous and tragic Dane (Hamlet), The Northman — despite a whopping budget that started at an estimated 65 million and finished closer to 90 million — is not likely to see the same kind of box office receipts enjoyed by Reeves’ 2022 blockbuster. Even so, one marvels that in Eggers’ short career he has been able to accomplish that rare feat: the delivery of auteurist visions immediately recognizable for meticulous period details and a commitment to uncompromising storytelling craft. The Northman also retains the filmmaker’s deep respect for the weird and the uncanny. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse (93 and 109 minutes to the 137 of Eggers’ 2022 film) are weirder and more uncanny, however, due in no small part to their closer proximity to the horror genre. The Northman has a few tricks up its sleeve, but Amleth’s mantra — “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir” — is indeed the essence of the plot. Eggers — writing this time with Icelandic lyricist, poet, novelist and performer Sjón — plays it straighter and safer than expected. A key twist cracks the door to a stunning possibility that should lead Amleth to ask himself a variant of another Pattinson-affiliated meme staple: “What if I’m the bad guy?” Had Eggers and Sjón focused on the intricacies and complexities of that idea, The Northman’s inevitable climactic duel — a spectacular, one-on-one, Gates of Hel holmgång visually reminiscent of Obi-Wan’s dismantling of Vader alongside the lava flows of Mustafar — might have delivered something unforgettable. The Northman has much to recommend it. Even though Björk’s part is small and not especially significant, fans can rightfully cheer the big screen return of the Icelandic musician, absent (with the exception of Drawing Restraint 9) since she paid the price to an abusive Lars von Trier in Dancer in the Dark more than two decades ago. Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest adds enough promise to make one wish the movie was called “The Northwoman,” while Willem Dafoe’s holy fool Heimir is better than any CG effect. And I just can’t stop thinking about the striking orthodontics or dental adornments worn by the screaming shield maiden. Ann Thompson and Neil Taylor’s Arden Shakespeare edition of Hamlet claims the story is second only to “Cinderella” as the world’s most-filmed, although the flood of Dracula variants, Sherlock Holmes iterations and versions of A Christmas Carol are in the conversation. Eggers has joked that his long-gestating remake of Nosferatu could be cursed by the ghost of F. W. Murnau, but I hope he gets to it in the near future. The Northman’s carefully choreographed, single-shot takes and startlingly lit close-ups — designed in collaboration with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke — blow the spatially disorienting and over-edited style of so many contemporary action films completely out of the fjord. Greg Carlson (@gcarlson1972) is a professor of communication studies and the director of the interdisciplinary film studies minor program at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota. He is also the film editor of the High Plains Reader, where his writing has appeared since 1997."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE," The Northman is practically bursting with testosterone. The story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking Prince hellbent on revenge, Robert Eggers‘s third film is essentially a case study in the destructive nature of unyielding masculinity. True to form, Eggers’s attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking and the meticulous director transports us to the Viking Age, a time when physical strength was synonymous with survival. But despite its singular title, The Northman is also filled with complex female characters subverting its rigid power structure. Three women, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and a mystical Seeress (Björk) all play pivotal roles in Amleth’s destiny, a battle with his sworn enemy on an Icelandic volcano. Eggers’s film may focus on the male obsession with dominance and destruction, but he juxtaposes this theme with the so-called “mysteries of women,” the intellect needed to navigate a world based on physical power. The men of The Northman live and die based on the strength of their bodies, but its women survive by the strength of their cunning. Queen Gudrún’s introductory line is a harbinger for the dark road ahead. As her excited son brings news of the King’s return, she delivers a sharp warning that he is never to enter her chamber without an invitation. Quickly softening, she expresses both love for her husband and concern for her son, whom she worries is not yet old enough to take over the kingdom. In the midst of Fjölnir’s coup, a disguised Amleth watches the conqueror carry his screaming mother through the village and declare her his new bride. Incapable of saving her, he is forced to leave her behind. Queen Gudrún has now become the damsel in distress he must rescue and his inability to do so will haunt him for the rest of his life. Years later, an adult Amleth has been adopted into a viking clan raiding the Land of Rus. After brutally conquering a village, he wanders into the ruins of a temple and encounters a blind Seeress with a galvanizing prophecy. She reminds him of his long ago oath and places in his hand a symbol of the tear he shed in the fragility of his childhood. Essentially shaming him for his weakness, she tells him it’s not enough to simply be strong. He must demonstrate his strength by conquering the man who once stole his power. She also foretells of a Maiden King who will play a role in his destiny, but once again, he has no interest in the female element of his fortune. Though we learn little of her origins, the Seeress first identifies Amleth as a slayer of her people and brother to the men who took her eyes. Perhaps she views her spiritual knowledge as a tool to emasculate him as revenge for her suffering. Powerless in the face of a strong enemy, she defends herself by reminding Amleth of his weakness and sending him off on a path of destruction.  Amleth finds the perfect opportunity to resume his quest with the shipment of slaves his clan has just captured. They are bound for the homestead of Fjölnir the Brotherless, now living in Iceland after losing his stolen kingdom to another conqueror. Amleth poses as a slave and sneaks aboard the ship. With no kingdom to fight for, his mission is now solely personal. Assuming his mother has merely been feigning love for the man who kidnapped her, he seeks to save her and reassert himself as the conquering hero. Though he likely sees his quest as altruistic, he is ultimately attempting to assuage the guilt he carries from leaving her behind as a child.  Aboard the ship, Amleth meets Olga of the Birch Forest, a captured maiden from the village he’s just conquered. Known as a spell-speaker, she practices a feminine Earth magic and vows to free herself through cunning. Though Olga asks for his help, Amleth soon learns that she is more than capable of defending herself. She resists Fjölnir’s unwanted advances by lifting her skirts to show that she is menstruating and wiping the blood in his face. She poisons the stew with mushrooms causing the “black dreams’’ that allow Amleth to wreak further havoc. Impressed with her bravery and spiritual knowledge, he asks about her practice. Olga tells him that her magic will stoke the flames of his sword and that the thread of her fate now entwines with his. Her flexibility stands in contrast to his rigid obsession. While Olga is content to listen to the Earth and follow her cues, Amleth will destroy anything that stands in the way of his chosen fate.  Amleth soon learns that the mysteries of women may have more bearing on his destiny than he once believed. On the eve of his vengeance, he confronts Gudrún with his true identity. Hoping for a joyful reunion, he instead learns a devastating truth. She was part of the plot to kill Amleth’s father. A slave stolen from a village very much like Olga’s, Gudrún was claimed and assaulted by King Aurvandil and Amleth is the product of a coupling she describes as savagery. She truly loves Fjölnir and was not screaming but laughing on the day in which he freed her from his brother’s control. Even worse, she is the one who demanded Amleth’s head. Seeing her first son as a product of her trauma, she ordered his death to destroy all reminders of her painful past. Mother and son now find themselves in opposition. He threatens the happy life she’s finally found, and she is one of the murders he’s sworn to kill.  Finally reckoning with the mysteries of women, Amleth is forced to confront the lie on which he’s based his life. Without the strength to physically dominate, the women who surround him have used cunning to align themselves with a strong protector. Gudrún found Fjölnir just as Olga found Amleth. Though both women genuinely love their chosen partners, these relationships likely began as necessary manipulation in search of powerful shelter. The Seeress gets her revenge by playing on Amleth’s fear and distracting him with the memory of his inadequacy. The women of The Northman survive by embracing their perceived weakness and using them as a cover to manipulate the minds of men obsessed with strength.  Ethics and nobility have very little place in this world and Gudrún and Olga must align themselves with the best bet for their own survival. Amleth is our hero because he is the lens through which we view the story, but he is a member of a Viking raid that slaughters villagers and burns children alive. The father he idolizes returns to his kingdom with slaves captured from a village he conquered on his voyage. The amulet he gives his son was taken from the neck of another prince, presumably after his murder. Though Fjölnir is presented as a villain, Gudrún sees him as a liberator, having freed her from a life with Aurvandil. But Fjölnir is a conqueror as well. He attempts to rape Olga and only backs down because she offends him. Neither heroes or villains, these men are simply a product of their destructive environment and the pillars through which the women must navigate. Interpretations of Eggers’ intended message may vary, but his fiery conclusion demonstrates the futility of Amleth’s quest. He does achieve his revenge, beheading Fjölnir next to a stunning lake of fire, but he is mortally wounded in the process. Both men fall to the ground, finally victims of the violence that has dominated their lives. Amleth dies on the battlefield, a highly prized end that guarantees him passage into Valhöll, the majestic afterlife for slain warriors. Though Amleth has achieved his stated goal, an alternate interpretation shows that he’s thrown his life away on a meaningless prophecy. Failing to understand the mysteries of women, he’s dedicated his life to saving a mother who does not want to be rescued, avenging a lecherous king, and murdering the man who actually saved his mother.  Pregnant with Amleth’s twins, Olga is now the sole survivor of his prophecy and bearer of his family’s line. Given her dedication to a more nurturing faith, perhaps she can steer his descendants away from obsessive destruction in a more sustainable direction. Her daughter will be the Maiden King that prophecy foretold and, with her mother’s guidance, will have the opportunity to reject the world of violence so prized by her ancestors. With her Earth magic, Olga will teach her children to embrace the constructive threads of their lives wherever they may lead.  It’s no surprise that after 35 years, people are still playing Nintendo’s classic grey brick in the Game Boy. What is surprising (well, not really) is that fans are developing and releasing games for the system. Thanks to programs like GB Studio, you too can develop your own Game Boy games, and that of course includes horror games. And there are plenty of ’em. So rather than listing off the usual suspects that includes Castlevania, Contra, and the like for the Game Boy’s anniversary, here’s a selection of more recent handheld horrors that you (if you have the right equipment) can play in all their spinach-coloured glory. Developer Ice Cold Blood’s mix of horror and comedy a la Elvira in Game Boy form, Batty Zabella puts you as the eponymous heroine as she tries to save her family and rid her home of phantoms. The game plays out much like the classic Shadowgate on the NES, where you use the D-pad to move a cursor around the screen. Moving the cursor over objects will generate a response from Zabella, indicating what you should do next. In addition to a ROM, you can also purchase the game as a cartridge from Retro Room Games. For those of the Lovecraft persuasion, -IZMA-‘s Deadeus is for you. This open-world Lovecraftian adventure game centers around a small boy who has a prophetic nightmare that reveals to him that everyone will die in 3 days. The boy now has to investigate his village to see how he can save them, if at all. The game has 11 endings and no direct path, leaving it up to the player to decide the best course of action. Much like Batty Zabella, you can also snag this in a nice physical version at incube8 Games. Play Novel: Silent Hill is a Japan-only adaptation of the original Silent Hill that was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance. So naturally, you have to do a demake for the Game Boy, which is what Diega did. While it’s still in development (you can only play Harry’s scenario at the moment), Silent Hill Play Novel is still very functional, and includes a pretty good translation. The next version of the game will include Cybil’s scenario. Described by developer Horatiu.nyc as an exercise to see how far the limitations of the Game Boy can be pushed to create a true atmospheric game, Bitterroot is the story of the cursed Bitterroot Mansion, and the secrets it holds. You take on the role of a stranded stranger, who ends up trapped in the mansion. The game requires you to search for key items in order to escape mansion. All the while, you’ll fight off its otherworldly inhabitants, and try to piece together the origins of the curse. burst_error’s Cryohazard is a concoction that’s inspired by classic point and click games, Choose Your Own Adventure books, and B-movie horror. The story has you waking up from a cryogenic sleep in a dilapidated research facility. Said facility is also full of monstrous mutants. As you might expect from it’s inspirations, there are multiple endings for this game, along with numerous gruesome deaths. Another title from Horatiu.nyc, Cargo has you playing as Moira, a scavenger who receives a tip about an abandoned ship with mysterious cargo on it that “a lot of very important people want.” So, you head on over to check it out. In order to claim the cargo, you’ll have to make your way to the main deck, but you’ll also have to manage your oxygen and ammo in order to get there. What you find should have stayed lost. Developed by Kadabura, this 1-3 experience is one for fans of body horror. You play as someone who has found themselves in an underground realm between life and death known as the Soul Void. Unlike others who are also in the Soul Void, you aren’t dead. Nor are you wanting to stick around. As such, you have to figure out why you’re in this place, and how to get back home. Along the way, you’ll encounter individuals whose bodies are in various forms of, shall we say, distress. A giallo on the Game Boy? Mixed with Junji Ito? flower studio’s title starts out simple enough: you play as an investigator assigned to find a young woman who has disappeared after moving into an old building at the edge of town. Remembering your gun this time, you’ve got to find her, and ultimately escape with your lives. Gameplay has you moving around the building to examine points of interest. You also meet several of the other residents in the building, who add to the disturbing atmosphere. We all miss the “What if?” of P.T.. Jonshaw01 certainly did, so they remade P.T. for the Game Boy. Don’t be fooled by the Pokémon-esque overhead view, as you’ll be creeped out pretty quickly while wandering the hallways. There’s also a hint menu that you can call up in case you get stuck. Don’t you hate it when you wake up to find something weird happened? MeteorArts’ eerie atmospheric title has a man named Jack waking up after an uneasy sleep to find the dead body of an unknown person in his living room. That’s on top of a few other things going on, including Jack’s wife being dead, a rather large spider roaming around your house, and Jack’s odd fascination with a plant that he’s been growing. The developer even has a short film that dives deeper into Jack’s story. Another short bit of horror, Opossum Country sees you as a delivery driver who while on a delivery finds himself in an isolated trailer park. Naturally, something isn’t quite right. Then again, you probably could’ve gathered that from the first resident, who warns you to move on quickly. However, your concern for one resident leads you to stumble into a situation that was best left alone. Yet another title by Horatiu.nyc, Neighbor has you playing as a young woman who has just found a spacious apartment for a great deal. A dream apartment, for sure. But as you might expect, there’s a reason why the place was such a bargain. Comprised of three chapters, Neighbor has two separate endings in the first two chapters, as well as several hidden secrets that expand the game’s world. A Metroidvania, you are the offspring of IT. What’s IT? IT is a bio-technological monstrosity that requires delicious souls for sustenance. It’s your job to find said souls to feed IT. As you feed IT, his power grows, as does your own. Every soul retrieved will enhance your mobility as you explore your surroundings. Feed IT Souls features two difficulty modes, including a “butt clenching precision platforming” Hard Mode. There are also 25 lost eggs located throughout the map. Find all of them to unlock a Bonus Mode. Elvies’ Days Without focuses on the bleakness that comes with the zombie apocalypse. A narrative-driven survival horror game with the expected gunplay, you play as Job an orphaned boy who finds himself in the midst of the end of the world. Depending on your choices, you can encounter one of five different endings. Not related to the Stephen King classic, Yliader’s game still has some Lovecraftian tinge to it. The story goes that you’ve been sent to work for a few months at a lighthouse after the previous keeper mysteriously went missing. Your tasks involve lighting the lighthouse’s lamp each night. However, with an approaching storm, you’re haunted by strange dreams at night. That, and it seems as if there’s something calling to you from below the lighthouse itself."
"Dec 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Northman is one of Robert Egger best films&#46; The scope&#44; the scale&#44; the atmospheric building of Norse mythology is groundbreaking&#46; Along with some insanely well acted performances and beyond thrilling action and revenge based story&#46; Must Watch Masterpiece&#33;
"Dec 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,The Northman creates a unique saga that taps into something truly primal before one hell of an ending&#46;
"Oct 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Epic, all-encompassing filmmaking unlike anything seen in  theatres today, The Northman tells its story of brutal revenge with a  potent blend of Scandinavian mythology, sword-swinging action, and  Shakespearean dramatics.  Based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth (which in turned  inspired Shakespeareâs Hamlet), The Northman blends the brute of John  Miliusâ Conan the Barbarian and the mysticism of John Boormanâs Excalibur in a Viking movie that is as much about old-world religion as it is a tale of  revenge, in which questing warrior Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) receives help  in the form of three witches who foretell prophecies of destiny. Swearing vengeance upon the head of his uncle Fjohir  (Claes Bang) for the murder of his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan  Hawke) and enslavement of his mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), the hulking  Amleth schemes his way into Fjohirâs isolated isle village where he dispatches his  enemies with extreme prejudice. The Northman is a film as strange as it is engrossing,  the use of Norse mysticism creating a world ancient in spirit and brutal in violence.  Filmed in varied locations in Northern Ireland, The Republic of Ireland, and  Iceland, director Robert Eggars along with cinematographer John Blaschke (The  Lighthouse) capture the greys, the mist, and the ancient landscapes  upon which this tale of mysticism and destiny take place. Skarsgard delivers one of his best turns yet as Amleth, blending  hulking brutality with moments of introspection as he encounters supernatural  elements beyond his comprehension, along with the legacy of a kingdom savagely  taken from him. Good too is Anya-Taylor Joy as Olga of the Birch Forest, a  soothsayer and slave who finds love and solace in Amlethâs arms. Ethan Hawke  and Willem Dafoe leave an impression in minor roles, especially Dafoe who takes  his penchant for portraying strange characters to new grimacing heights.  Eggers, who previously impressed with The Witch and The Lighthouse, has forever changed the Viking film with The  Northman, an intoxicating and epic blend of violence, mysticism, and  breathtaking visuals that establishes the presence of a heavyweight filmmaker whose  distinctive vision is needed now more than ever. "
"Oct 3, 2022",POSITIVE," If you love “Hamlet” but you’ve always thought the ending was too upbeat, then “The Northman” is the movie for you. Spectacle, pageantry and myth combine with blood, mud and abs for a dazzling, uproarious Viking spree in which Alexander Skarsgård seeks to avenge the murder of his father with the aid of Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Queen’s Gambit”) and Icelandic national treasure Björk.  Robert Eggers (“The Lighthouse”) brings to life the Norse legend that also inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” that of prince Amleth, who is robbed of his birthright when his father, the king, is murdered by his own brother. The murderous Fjölnir (Claes Bang) claims not only his brother’s crown but his queen (Nicole Kidman) as well. The young prince narrowly escapes his uncle’s wrath and is presumed dead, but when we meet him again years later, he is all grown up into a revenge-seeking Viking, ruthless, bloodthirsty, well-trained and handy with an ax.  Ethan Hawke plays the doomed King Aurvandil, and the film’s first scenes are vital to the emotional core of the film, which threatens at times to get lost in gore. Vital to the story is a long sequence with young Amleth and Aurvandil in a trippy ceremony led by Willem Dafoe, who you absolutely want as your spirit guide through any ancient Nordic hallucinogenic journeys in which you connect with your ancestors and your fate. This ceremony bonds young Amleth to the father he reveres, and Hawke’s presence, although brief on screen, is felt throughout the rest of the film. Without this well-established emotional connection, Amleth’s bloody adventures would have felt meaningless. Any one of the elements of wild action, fabulous fantasy or high drama could have outweighed the other at any point, but Eggers keeps things in balance throughout the film’s lengthy run time. The characters are archetypes from ancient lore, but grounding moments bring them alive as people who we care about. Kidman was particularly effective as Queen Gudrun, from whom we do not hear much for at least half of the film. When the long-sought-after reunion between mother and son takes place, she unleashes a stunning onslaught of emotion, and Kidman is electrifying, subverting expectations of maternity, to say the least. But the real reason to watch “The Northman” is because of how it looks. Eggers develops the stylized sensibility of his earlier films on a grand scale here, reveling in the visual spectacle of vast Icelandic mountains, swiftly flowing rivers (of both blood and water), forests, intestines, fire, birds and much more. Recurring visions are rendered gorgeously, turning this ancient myth, which was eventually translated into “Hamlet,” one of the cornerstones of the Western canon, into a moving illuminated manuscript.  Contemporary bodies tell a tale you read in your English class and — similar to the even trippier, recent “The Green Knight” adaptation — this film does not feel old-fashioned in the slightest. It is highly accessible but never anachronistic. A visceral and vivid dreamscape of an action film, “The Northman” delivers if you like to see people fighting but want to feel intellectual about it. It’s a fascinating historical myth that also happens to have a bloody, heavy-metal heart. “Top Gun: Maverick”: After more than 30 years of service as one of the U.S. Navy’s top aviators, Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) is where he belongs, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. When he finds himself training a detachment of Top Gun graduates for a specialized mission, the likes of which no living pilot has ever seen, Maverick encounters Lt. Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of Maverick’s late friend and radar intercept officer, Lt. Nick “Goose” Bradshaw. Facing an uncertain future and confronting the ghosts of his past, Maverick is drawn into a confrontation with his own deepest fears, culminating in a mission that demands the ultimate sacrifice from those who will be chosen to fly it.

"Sep 24, 2022",POSITIVE," King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returns to his kingdom with the bounties of war. He greets his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and gifts his young son Amleth (Oscar Novak) with a trinket that he had pillaged. It’s a gift fit for a man, not a young boy, and the starting point for Amleth’s journey into manhood. The King has returned from war grievously injured and he refuses to succumb to injuries or die as a “grey beard.” He will die in battle and before he does, he wants to ensure that his son is ready for the duties that will be bestowed upon him upon his death. In these early scenes of The Northman, Robert Eggers sets the stage for a visceral, otherworldly exploration of Norse mythology and religion. The King and Amleth venture into a smoke-filled inner sanctum where Heimir the Fool (Willem Defoe) acts as their guide, summoning the spirits of their ancestors and their descendants to help with this passage from boyhood into manhood. But it’s the tragedy that follows that launches Amleth onto a different path, one marred with pain, vengeance, and obsession. When they depart from Heimir, King War-Raven is slaughtered by his bastard half-brother Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) and the Queen is taken. Amleth barely escapes with his life, though given the trajectory that he is set upon, the vengeance that consumes his life, perhaps a part of him died that day. With the young boy’s vow to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir, The Northman moves forward in time until Amleth (now Alexander Skarsgård) is a grown man and an active and willing participant in the pillaging and plundering of neighboring villages. It’s violent, bloodthirsty, animalistic, and true to the history of the Vikings. The men don wolf pelts, beating their chests, howling at the moon, drinking herbed wine (laced with, presumably, hallucinogenic mushrooms), sending them straight into Berserker mode. It’s here, in this half-slaughtered village, that Amleth first encounters Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose striking white-blond hair sets her apart from the rest of the villagers. As they are rounding up the villagers to ship off as slaves, Amleth learns that they are destined to be delivered to the farm that Fjölnir has made for himself after being ousted by another king. He seizes this opportunity, cutting his hair and branding himself as a slave to be sent to Fjölnir. On the journey to Fjölnir’s, Olga recognizes him as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but they form a connection that perseveres, even in the worst of times. Upon his arrival, Amleth discovers that his mother has remained with Fjölnir and they have had a son together. She seems, at least to outside observers, to be happy. Both as a wife and as a mother to Fjölnir’s eldest son, Thórir the Proud (Gustav Lindh) and their son Gunnar (Elliott Rose). While he could take swift action and avenge his father, Amleth paces himself. There is trust to earn, slaves to free, seeds to sow, and uncomfortable truths to uncover. Olga is presented to him as an alternative path for his life, a deviation from a life filled with vengeance, hatred, and self-isolation. She is gentle and kind, but deadly in her own right. She is a perfect match for Amleth, willing to fight alongside him for a future together, but ultimately the temptation of Valhalla is too strong. While The Northman does present a shockingly-accurate portrayal of the 9th century, it does employ a healthy dose of “Hollywood magic” to create a compelling and engaging story for the 21st-century audience. While not quite a true story, Amleth is a figure from Scandinavian legends, and the basis for William Shakespeare’s tragedy Hamlet. The connection between the two stories is impossible to ignore—right down to the pointed Oedipus complex. As someone who has spent the better part of her life entranced with the rich wonders of Norse mythology, Eggers is the first to portray Norse spirituality, Valhalla, and figures like the Seeress (Björk) and Halla the Maiden (Rebecca Ineson), with the sort of respect that they are owed. These aren’t Party City Vikings, these are Vikings whose blood, sweat, and tears are palpable. The Seeress and Halla aren’t objects to be desired—these are women designed to be feared and venerated. If The Dig whet your appetite for Viking boat burials, then The Northman will be a feast for the historical soul. With the sweeping, immersive cinematography, and the way in which the film fully embraces the beauty and horror of Nordic history, The Northman is positioned to be Robert Eggers’ best film yet. He leaves no stone unturned, reminding the audiences of how violent, superstitious, and duty-bound the Nordic people were. Eggers’ script, which he co-wrote with Icelandic author Sjón, provides the groundwork for powerful, unexpected storytelling. As raw and masculine as so much of the film is, perhaps to the extreme, even, it’s still focused on the heart of things with a keen, intentional line drawn towards the reverence of the feminine. Skarsgård is utterly transformed by this role, more beast than man in the heat of battle, but still a boy desperate for the love he never received as a child. It’s a tragedy because Amleth was forged by the negligence of the elders around him, shaped into a weapon of vengeance that ultimately brings him swiftly into the gates of Valhalla. But even in the tragedy of it all, there’s a hope that blooms among the leaves of his family tree and the promise that his line will continue, with purposeful emphasis on his daughter. The Northman, coupled with last year’s oft-overlooked The Green Knight, stands as a stark reminder that there is still a place in cinema for gorgeous, inspired odysseys, rife with literary allusions, deep-seated spiritual meanings, and an exploration of complex human emotions. Vengeance is a potent drug, more deadly than any hallucinogenic tonic, Berserker, or rabid dog. It comes in the dark of the night and strikes right at the heart of even the strongest Viking."

"Sep 1, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium & packed with powerhouse performances. From his very first feature film, it’s been clear that Robert Eggers is a bit of a rulebreaker. Whether it comes to tackling shocking or seemingly taboo subject matter or turning in scripts that are often borderline incomprehensible to those who aren’t well versed in 17th or 19th Century English, there’s no denying that Eggers has quickly established his own signature style in today’s cinematic space (which is no small feat), advancing to become one of the most defining auteurs of the era, who is beholden to no artistic restriction. And, as a result of knocking it out of the park twice in a row with cinephiles and critics with 2016’s The Witch and 2019’s The Lighthouse, Eggers was granted his least creative constraints yet with this year’s The Northman. Along with differing in distribution from his first two films (both of which were distributed by A24, while Northman is in the fine hands of Focus Features), The Northman comes with a $90 million budget – over 20x The Witch’s and 9x The Lighthouse’s – and a runtime of nearly 2 ½ hours, while The Witch and The Lighthouse ran for 93 minutes and 109 minutes, respectively. Since the start, we’ve known that The Northman was going to be a story told on an unprecedented scale for Eggers, but while some artists achieve new professional actualization when their creativity can’t be curbed, others crumble under the pressure of making the jump from indies to blockbusters and meeting studio demands. Luckily, Eggers is no such artist, delivering his best film to date with The Northman – an epic the likes of which we hardly see in Hollywood anymore, carefully curated by a master of the medium. Our chaotic chronicle commences as a young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) awaits the arrival of his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke, of The Before Trilogy and Moon Knight), from war. Injured, Aurvandill confides in his wife and Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, of Big Little Lies and Being the Ricardos) that he must start showing Amleth the ways of the world in preparation of possibly becoming king himself someday soon, with these teachings being relayed by Aurvandill’s friend – and local “fool” – Heimir (Willem Dafoe, of Spider-Man: No Way Home and Aquaman). However, upon leaving their communion, Aurvandill and Amleth are attacked by Fjölnir (Claes Bang, of The Square and The Girl in the Spider’s Web), Aurvandill’s brother and Amleth’s uncle, with the former succumbing to his slaughter and the latter escaping to the ocean, vowing to return to avenge his father and save his mother. Years later, we find that Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, of True Blood and Passing) has taken up with a pack of traveling raiders, abandoning his quest in favor of mindlessly savage and superficial pursuits. But a chance meeting with the Seeress (Björk, of Dancer in the Dark) reminds him of his true purpose, sending him back to his homeland, where he discovers that Fjölnir has lost his family’s kingdom and is now instead a feudal lord, with Gudrún as his wife, who has bore his son. Posing as a slave, Amleth slowly integrates himself into Fjölnir’s feudal community, where he also falls for fellow slave – and sorceress – Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, of The Queen’s Gambit and Last Night in Soho) who shows him an alternative path in life, one defined by hope instead of hurt. Yet can he ever escape the emotional corruption that has consumed him since childhood, or is violence doomed to beget more violence until the end of time? As soon as this story starts, audiences are instantly enraptured by the immensely eerie yet utterly enthralling aesthetic Robert Eggers is so famously known for – combining Jarin Blaschke’s consummate cinematography with staggering sound work from James Boyle, James Harrison, and Steve Little, and Sebastian Gainsborough and Robin Carolan’s striking score – as his trusted crew is not only firing on all cylinders but additionally operating at a higher level than ever before as a result of being given their greatest cinematic canvas yet.  Every shot is a sumptuous masterwork, fully immersing us in these brutal yet oddly beautiful environments, so that we too can see the dawn of the sun as distinctly as Amleth and his fellow slaves or hear the horrific hacking-and-slashing as if such slayings were happening only a few feet away. Few creatives have such a commendable command over the synthesis of cinematic sights and sounds as Robert Eggers does, and that’s the first thing that separates The Northman from similar historical revenge sagas like Braveheart or Gladiator – for starters, none of ‘em look or sound as good as this one. Similarly, though The Northman clearly takes after the set-up of a famous Shakespearean play (Amleth = Hamlet, anyone?), Eggers and co-writer Sjón (Lamb) do enough to differentiate their take on the classic tale (despite Amleth serving as inspiration for the tragedy of Prince Hamlet in the first place) to shape a story that stands on its own. Structurally, the passage of time added between Aurvandill’s passing and Amleth’s revenge serves to make his mission more meaningful and monumental, while an additional character arc for Kidman’s Gudrún (this adventure’s alternate for Hamlet’s Gertrude) and an entirely original character in the form of Taylor-Joy’s love interest Olga not only fine-tune the female players in Amleth’s (*cough* Hamlet’s *cough*) life but also present him with new quandaries to consider. His relationship with Olga in particular is not only conceptually riveting from start-to-finish but ultimately unbearably emotionally resonant, as he’s forced to choose between a potentially prosperous future with her or putting away the pains of his past for good, with ruinous results. Likewise, Eggers and Sjón cleverly complicate Amleth’s crusade to avoid advocating for a message that revenge or violence is in any way rewarding or fulfilling, most notably with tragic third act revelations that completely reframe Amleth’s entire expedition – and existence – up until this point, assuring that every action that follows is accompanied by a piercing prescience indicating that Amleth will never achieve the alleviation from this anguish that he so desires. The two also candidly challenge the suggestion that one’s fate is set in stone, especially via Taylor-Joy’s Olga, as she pleads with Amleth to remember that he has a choice in life and can break this cycle of violence, releasing him and everyone else from this collective enmity. Eggers and Sjón compassionately characterize the viking culture of the era to show what belief systems they subscribe to and why, but they simultaneously establish an engrossing dialogue between tradition and philosophical transformation, making this the rare revenge epic that has more on its mind than murder. Every actor in this exhilarating ensemble is similarly at the top of their game, no matter how many scenes they star in, led by Alexander Skarsgård in an awe-inspiring animalistic turn as the assiduous Amleth, prevailing when it comes to portraying his protagonist’s propulsive physicality but excelling just as efficiently when it comes to his essential emoting in the affecting third act, bringing a greater insight into just how broken this behemoth of a man truly is.  Though most of the movie does center around his titular Northman, every other performer matches his might when asked to contribute their piece to the plot, from Willem Dafoe and Björk with startling near-single-scene performances, to Ethan Hawke’s admirable ardor as King Aurvandill, to Claes Bang’s frigid ferocity as Fjölnir, to Anya Taylor-Joy’s opulent optimism as Olga, and, last but not least, to the glorious Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún, who all but steals the show in one momentous monologue to Skarsgård’s Amleth as things start to head south in the homestretch, uprooting our entire perception of her part in a way only an adept actress as she can do. Stylistically and thematically, The Northman is undeniably Robert Eggers’ crowning achievement as a director to date, with the auteur succeeding at shaping a raucous revenge saga that stirs the soul as much as it stuns one’s senses. Paired with his positively capable cast and crew, Eggers brings this era back to life in fierce fashion, throwing us into a time and place filled with ferality and fatality but not devoid of faith for a better future, delivering a dark depiction of the sobering struggle between fate and free will. After making a name for himself in the indie world and now leveling up to blockbuster fare with ravishing results, it remains to be seen what challenges are left for Robert Eggers to conquer, but it’s safe to say that, if The Northman is any indication, he’s unquestionably up for the task."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE," Twentieth-century softies like me may experience a film like Robert Eggers’ The Northman as a contemptuous but invigorating slap in the chops. Life was hard in AD 895, and every frame of the movie is there to show it, in all its magic-hour, snow-flecked beauty and all its torn-flesh, bloody-mud-puddle ugliness. Like Eggers’ two previous films — The Witch and The Lighthouse, both of which I adore — The Northman devotes itself to recreating a time long past, along with its moods, attitudes and details of day-to-day life. It would be easy indeed to parody The Northman, with all its shrieking madmen and howling to the black sky and chanting in the Old Languages. But Eggers offers up this material so earnestly, and with such carefully crafted art, that to lampoon it would feel callow and vile.  I’m about 75% on board with the film — it runs a bit long, and we start to feel it with about half an hour left to go — but I’m glad it was made, and I hope its poor showing at the box office won’t put Eggers in movie jail. This is the sort of expensive, excessive fantasia that sniffs around in deeper, darker nooks of cinema largely forgotten about and lifts the art form. The Northman is loud, with a brooding score and metal clashing against metal, but it has more in common with silent film than with anything else around. Based on the legend of Amleth (which in turn spawned Hamlet), it seems to want to take us back to the beginning of drama, or at least the birth of many tropes. It tells the most elemental of stories, the one about the son avenging his father, and grafts a lot of pagan strangeness and gore onto it.  Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is out to get his stinky uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who murdered Amleth’s father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and married his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). For years, Amleth grunts and growls and readies himself for the moment when he realizes his oath: “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Amleth’s entire life becomes about that, after which, he guesses, he’ll just kill himself or something, because his life will no longer have purpose. Amleth does pursue a brief interest in the young sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who proposes another level of purpose to Amleth’s life. But mainly his fate seems to be mired in rage and pain and blood. It may take a little bit before a viewer recognizes that Amleth as presented here isn’t really the hero, just the protagonist.  The images appear to be charged by the post-human energies of spirits and fae. The shadows and scents of femininity seem to reduce these crude, brutal men to animals, and the women, dealing with this off-the-scale-toxic masculinity, are in danger of becoming inhuman wretches themselves. Queen Gudrún, for instance, certainly comes across as vindictive and cruel, but to what extent have the culture of 895 and its sickening rules (rape is no big deal, it’s part of every king’s victory lap) made her that way? There are other men, though, noncombatants, fools, he-witches, who have wiser heads — until they lose them to someone with a hotter head, plus a sword. The Northman seems simple, or simplistic, until we start turning it around and peering at it.   The sensibilities we see in the movie are very remote from ours. We could almost be watching aliens. Sometimes the film has a harshly musical Icelandic vibe; Eggers recruits the Icelandic poet Sjón as his co-scripter here, and puts Björk in majestic electrocuted-penguin garb as a character called the Seeress. As I said, the narrative begins to drag a little, but the compositions and the colors of night and the cast’s dedication to exploring long-gone behaviors — all of this is first-rate. The Northman might be my least favorite Eggers project, but that means nothing — oh, it’s only a B+, or maybe even an A-. Eggers goes big here, and uses paints he hasn’t used before. His three films feel alike, in that they could all unfold in the same uncanny, demon-haunted universe at different times, but they’re also very distinct accomplishments. Eggers is still a major reason to stay interested in whatever movies are becoming."
"Aug 8, 2022",POSITIVE," I’d love to have been a fly on the wall for the pitch. “Um, it’s an adaptation of a 12th-century Norse folk tale about a prince avenging the death of his father — you know, Shakespeare, well this one inspired Hamlet. It’s going to be really violent and much of it will be subtitled in Norse. But the farting and burping scene with Ethan Hawke is really going to work — trust me, Ethan’s put in a lot of work. Oh and we got Björk for the witch.”"

As Nicole Kidman says in her AMC cinemas ad the kids are loving to parody on TikTok, somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this. For Old Nic, here playing Queen Gudrun, that place is ancient Iceland and the heartbreak is the impending death of her husband King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke). He has returned from a pillaging trip with a brutal stomach wound and the desire to pass the royal mantle to their son Amleth (played as a young man by Oscar Novak).  Amleth escapes to the sea, chanting to himself as he rows to safety the mantra, ""I will revenge you father, I will save you mother, I will kill you Fjolnir."" Years later, Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgard) has joined the berserkers, a Viking killing machine, biding his time to one day enact his planned revenge. Branding himself as a slave, he stows away on a slave trader vessel destined for the village uncle Fjolnir now lords over and is befriended by feisty sorceress slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy).  There's an element of supernatural horror to the film, which is something Eggers did so well in his debut film The Witch that introduced Anya Taylor-Joy to the world. "
"Jul 26, 2022",POSITIVE," Hey, so you might have noticed my reviews haven’t been as frequent this year. Well, due to both professional and personal reasons, I’ve not been able to give the site as much attention as I would like. Your girl has got a lot of plates spinning right now, and as much as I love doing it, Alternative Lens isn’t as important as my ultimate career aspirations or my mental health. However, that didn’t mean I stopped seeing as many movies. In fact, I’ve seen so many more so far this year than I had by this time in 2021. So as a result, my bi-annual attempt to catch up on everything I didn’t have time to do a full review of, or didn’t have much of a take to warrant doing one, or just saw way too late, is now MUCH larger than it’d usually be. But if you REALLY need to know my thoughts on a movie as soon as I’ve seen it, give me a follow on Letterboxd here: https://letterboxd.com/AltFilmLens/. I’ll often do my quick thoughts on movies straight after I’ve seen them, including first watches of older films or revisiting movies I’ve seen before. So if you’ve been missing me on here and looking for more AltLens content, head on over to Letterboxd. It’s where all the cool kids are these days. (Disclaimer: I only saw this movie because I had time to kill and was able to see it for free. I would never have bothered otherwise, ‘cos I ain’t giving any of my money to Mumsnet Anita Bryant.) Most films end up being overhyped and can’t help but be disappointing once you finally see them. This is one of those rare exceptions. Everything Everywhere All at Once takes advantage of every aspect of the cinematic form to tell a story you couldn’t do justice in any other medium. It’s up there with Mad Max: Fury Road, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Matrix, in that it’s a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters: story, character, and theme. Michelle Yeoh has never been better. Stephaine Hsu is a revelation. Ke Huy Quan: truly a star reborn! I hope this is just the start of a renaissance for him. And who could ever say a bad thing about James Hong or Jamie Lee Curtis? But the real stars here are the Daniels. The screenplay and direction are just pure perfection. Yes, one could nitpick about certain logic gaps, but if you’re focusing that much on those insignificant details, then you’re watching movies wrong. The way they’ve balanced all the genre elements and absurdist comedy whilst also tackling some pretty dark and serious subject matter is the stuff of legends; the kind of excellence that will be studied and gushed over by film academics for decades to come. If there’s a better movie than this in 2022, then 2022 will have been a bloody landmark year for cinema. 10/10! “There are honestly worse movies this year, but on a moral level I’d rather you watch them than this, because at least there you don’t have to give a portion of your purchase to Prosecco Orson Scott Card.” No, if you read my review in full, you’d see I had plenty of criticism of the film itself; mainly the sloppy writing and lack of whimsy. I would have given the same score regardless of any personal feelings about the screenwriter and her opinions. It’s just an added reminder to readers about the commerce behind art which, whether you ignore it or not, exists and has an impact on the success of a piece. Also, this is my website. There’s no code of conduct stopping me from expressing my personal opinions. If I were writing this for another site, I would probably hold back those thoughts, but here I don’t have to. You don’t have to like my opinion, but not you or anyone else gets to police what I say. I thought folk like you were all about “freeze peach” and all that?"

The Northman, a medieval nordic epic written and directed by Robert Eggers, begins with a familiar setup: a young prince loses his family and kingdom in an act of fraternal betrayal. King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is assassinated by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), while his young son Amleth watches; the young prince also sees Fjölnir kidnap his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), as part of a bloody coup to seize Aurvandil’s title and land. 




Barely avoiding capture, Amleth escapes and rows away, repeating a vow to avenge his father, kill his uncle, and rescue his mother—an overture to the story of a hero. (The film is based on a Scandinavian legend, recorded in the 13th century, that may have inspired Hamlet.)
We next see Amleth (played as an adult by Alexander Skarsgård) years later, now a formidable warrior applying his martial prowess to raiding Slavic villages. His revenge oath has been indefinitely deferred in favor of pillaging with a band of shamanic berserkers; he isn’t yet aware of Fjölnir’s movements, that his uncle has lost his land and fled to Iceland. Only after the urging of a mystical figure played by the musician Björk does Amleth resume his quest. He disguises himself as a slave bound for Fjölnir’s settlement; once he arrives, he plans a series of escalating attacks with the help of another captive, a Slavic sorceress named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). The campaign eventually destroys the remnant’s of Fjölnir’s kingdom, and Amleth faces his rival in a final duel at the top of a volcano.
Although The Northman represents Eggers’s most ambitious project yet, both in its narrative scope and budget, he is known for choosing stories like this—spooky historical dramas that can skew melodramatic—and managing to avoid sentimentality and shtick through obsessive, anthropological detail. In his previous films (The Witch, a horror film set on the edges of a 17th-century New England Puritan settlement, and The Lighthouse, a darkly funny 19th-century drama that follows two bickering lighthouse keepers in their descent into madness), Eggers has a knack for collecting period-specific ephemera—phrases from accounts of demonic possession, antique camera lenses, a museum-replica pagan rattle, and hand-stitched costumes—to make a coherent facsimile of a world. When the method works, tenets that might seem prosaic to modern viewers become vivid and urgent, located within a faithful reproduction of the setting that produced them.
Although there are flashes of this sensibility throughout The Northman, the film falls into an awkward middle ground between blockbuster epic and the cerebral historical dramas that preceded it, not quite filling either prompt. Moments of revelatory strangeness come inconsistently, and they feel disjointed from a plot that’s too unwieldy for verisimilitude alone to carry. The sequences that lack a sense of context to animate them can feel rote or even silly—a scene in which Amleth duels a ghost skeleton for a magic sword, for example; a couple of instances of animal-based deus ex machina; or the abrupt end of Olga and Amleth’s romantic relationship, soundtracked with a swell of music that make its pathos feel forced. Still, beyond the less convincing scenes, there are glimpses of a more interesting story that reflects Eggers’s broader interest in outcasts, grievance, and the futility of honoring one’s fate.

The parts of The Northman that take place in Iceland are set during a period early in the country’s colonization, about 16 years before the establishment of its parliament in 930 ad. The choice was intentional: The Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, who cowrote the script with Eggers, told The New Yorker that he “realized that we could slip in a family there, that settled early and then just disappeared from the face of the earth.” In his other films, Eggers has chosen settings on the fringes of a more formal society, which is effective for horror because it makes the consequences of interpersonal friction more dire. To see the danger of these places feels like a forgotten instinct: These small and isolated communities have no guarantee of survival, making their members both acutely dependent on and vulnerable to one another.
When we first see Fjölnir’s settlement, a cluster of buildings in a wide green valley in the shadow of a volcano, it feels precarious, barely rooted in the earth even before the machinations of a vengeful prince work to dismantle it. It’s the kind of place that, in Sjón’s words, looks like it could “just [disappear] from the face of the earth.” Sod-roofed structures covered in fresh grass appear halfway to being swallowed by the ground. With vast stretches of uninhabited wilderness as their alternative, a human village, even one as violent and miserable as Fjölnir’s, binds its inhabitants to it: “Even if you did escape this farm, you’d only be carrion for the blue fox and selkies,” another captive tells Amleth.

In Iceland, for Amleth, two tenets meant to ensure the preservation of social order soon come into conflict: the taboo on murder and the duty to enact vengeance on murderers, especially those who kill kings, whose position of invulnerability is necessary for the strength of the state. This paradox—whether to carry out a string of killings to symbolically buttress the sanctity of life—is at the center of many tragedies, including Hamlet. In The Northman, Amleth doesn’t dwell much on these social and moral intricacies: At one point he kills an opponent during a sports match by headbutting him to death. Yet he decides that he can’t take his final revenge on Fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the Slavic village are met. “It was foretold that I would slay my father’s killer in a burning lake,” Amleth says. “Until that day comes, I will torment the man who made my life hell…. We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.
 Barely avoiding capture, Amleth escapes and rows away, repeating a vow to avenge his father, kill his uncle, and rescue his mother—an overture to the story of a hero. (The film is based on a Scandinavian legend, recorded in the 13th century, that may have inspired Hamlet.)

The choice was intentional: The Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, who cowrote the script with Eggers, told The New Yorker that he “realized that we could slip in a family there, that settled early and then just disappeared from the face of the earth.” In his other films, Eggers has chosen settings on the fringes of a more formal society, which is effective for horror because it makes the consequences of interpersonal friction more dire. To see the danger of these places feels like a forgotten instinct: These small and isolated communities have no guarantee of survival, making their members both acutely dependent on and vulnerable to one another.
When we first see Fjölnir’s settlement, a cluster of buildings in a wide green valley in the shadow of a volcano, it feels precarious, barely rooted in the earth even before the machinations of a vengeful prince work to dismantle it. It’s the kind of place that, in Sjón’s words, looks like it could “just [disappear] from the face of the earth.” Sod-roofed structures covered in fresh grass appear halfway to being swallowed by the ground. With vast stretches of uninhabited wilderness as their alternative, a human village, even one as violent and miserable as Fjölnir’s, binds its inhabitants to it: “Even if you did escape this farm, you’d only be carrion for the blue fox and selkies,” another captive tells Amleth.

In Iceland, for Amleth, two tenets meant to ensure the preservation of social order soon come into conflict: the taboo on murder and the duty to enact vengeance on murderers, especially those who kill kings, whose position of invulnerability is necessary for the strength of the state. This paradox—whether to carry out a string of killings to symbolically buttress the sanctity of life—is at the center of many tragedies, including Hamlet. In The Northman, Amleth doesn’t dwell much on these social and moral intricacies: At one point he kills an opponent during a sports match by headbutting him to death. Yet he decides that he can’t take his final revenge on Fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the Slavic village are met. “It was foretold that I would slay my father’s killer in a burning lake,” Amleth says. “Until that day comes, I will torment the man who made my life hell…. We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.
 Although The Northman represents Eggers’s most ambitious project yet, both in its narrative scope and budget, he is known for choosing stories like this—spooky historical dramas that can skew melodramatic—and managing to avoid sentimentality and shtick through obsessive, anthropological detail. In his previous films (The Witch, a horror film set on the edges of a 17th-century New England Puritan settlement, and The Lighthouse, a darkly funny 19th-century drama that follows two bickering lighthouse keepers in their descent into madness), Eggers has a knack for collecting period-specific ephemera—phrases from accounts of demonic possession, antique camera lenses, a museum-replica pagan rattle, and hand-stitched costumes—to make a coherent facsimile of a world. When the method works, tenets that might seem prosaic to modern viewers become vivid and urgent, located within a faithful reproduction of the setting that produced them.
Although there are flashes of this sensibility throughout The Northman, the film falls into an awkward middle ground between blockbuster epic and the cerebral historical dramas that preceded it, not quite filling either prompt. Moments of revelatory strangeness come inconsistently, and they feel disjointed from a plot that’s too unwieldy for verisimilitude alone to carry. The sequences that lack a sense of context to animate them can feel rote or even silly—a scene in which Amleth duels a ghost skeleton for a magic sword, for example; a couple of instances of animal-based deus ex machina; or the abrupt end of Olga and Amleth’s romantic relationship, soundtracked with a swell of music that make its pathos feel forced. Still, beyond the less convincing scenes, there are glimpses of a more interesting story that reflects Eggers’s broader interest in outcasts, grievance, and the futility of honoring one’s fate.

In The Northman, Amleth doesn’t dwell much on these social and moral intricacies: At one point he kills an opponent during a sports match by headbutting him to death. Yet he decides that he can’t take his final revenge on Fjölnir until the terms of the prophecy made by the seer in the Slavic village are met. “It was foretold that I would slay my father’s killer in a burning lake,” Amleth says. “Until that day comes, I will torment the man who made my life hell…. We thirst for vengeance, but we cannot escape our fate.” In the meantime, with Olga’s help, he executes a gruesome series of attacks on Fjölnir’s men, laden with religious symbolism, which the settlement’s priestess at first blames on a “distempered spirit.”
In this sense, The Northman resembles other recent films—The Green Knight, for example, based on the Arthurian chivalric romance, and Martin Scorsese’s mob drama The Irishman—that place preordained male violence in a nihilistic, almost ironic register rather than in the heroic or tragic tone of an epic. These films facilitate a reading in which acts of violence that define a person’s life can provide a necessary sense of purpose and belonging but also be arbitrary, incidental, or vaguely foolish. Partway through Amleth’s campaign, his mother, Gudrún, confronts him with the revelation that his quest is built on childhood illusions about his parents and that she very much invited Fjölnir’s act of betrayal. Enraged, Amleth kills his uncle’s son, but he isn’t dissuaded from his goal. At the beginning of his final confrontation with Fjölnir, instead of rescuing Gudrún, Amleth murders her in a struggle.
In these films, the violence of men trapped by fate appears both inevitable and like a waste of time; their blood feuds, which give them purpose, contain no inherent depth, eloquence, or special insight. By the film’s conclusion, Amleth’s commitment to vengeance seems divorced from the people it was intended to honor or protect, rolling forward on the strength of its own, preordained inertia. If in Hamlet a prince’s desire for revenge is checked by doubt and melancholia, The Northman’s Amleth would find that kind of introspection totally alien. This single-minded devotion to fate would benefit from Eggers’s anthropological insight; without it, we’re left to extrapolate from religious rituals and scenes of parochial drudgery that being governed by destiny, no matter how destructive, may offer transcendence in a grim, chaotic world. “Hate is all I have ever known,” Amleth tells Olga in the one brief moment in which he considers abandoning his quest to kill Fjölnir. “But I wish I could be free of it.”
The Northman is a brutal and violent film, felt in both its protagonist’s appetite for revenge and a world that seems to require suffering to continue turning. Enslaved laborers are killed at random; in the continuous shots of battle that Eggers favors, half a dozen discrete, horrifying injuries might play out within the same few seconds. During the raid on the Slavic village early in the film, Amleth rips out a man’s throat with his teeth and howls to the sky like a wolf. But the film suddenly cuts ahead, to just after the battle. Amleth is part of a tableau of a dozen wounded berserkers who are hunched over, panting and bleeding from open cuts, their muscles trembling with exhaustion or pain. A separate group of more uniformly dressed and armored fighters administrate the raid’s aftermath. In the longer view, Amleth’s group, dominant in battle, gains the connotation of hired muscle, useful in the fight but peripheral to its planning and an afterthought in the allocation of its rewards.
That moment has curious implications. It presents comfort with brutality as a skill within a hierarchy of skills that a medieval society needs filled, and casts Amleth’s quest in an almost entrepreneurial light. But those threads aren’t pursued. Soon after, Amleth hears about Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom and his departure to Iceland from a fellow fighter as he is sharpening an axe. “Fjölnir killed his brother for nothing. Now he’s a sheep farmer,” the fighter says, laughing, as the cycle of fate starts over again.

"Jun 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman isn’t exactly a triumph, but with its many knockout moments, it represents a big step forward for the youngish director Robert Eggers, who for the first time has a big budget ($90 million) to work with. "
"Jun 28, 2022",POSITIVE," [CAUTION: There are some very general, spoiler-ish observations in this review that concern its closing scenes and the relationship between those scenes and the endings of Robert Eggers’ previous films The Witch and The Lighthouse.] It’s kind of amazing how many films I’ve seen built upon the Inigo Montoya mantra. (Let’s say it together: “You killed my father. Prepare to die.“) It’s even more amazing how fundamental that storyline is, considering the fact that I have never met a single human being whose father has been murdered by a traitorous acquaintance. Nor have I ever met anyone who had an opportunity to go on a revenge quest. And yet, just this morning, in conversation with a wise counselor, what was I wrestling with? I was tending to some wounds that I suffered as a young boy during a season of my father’s unemployment. At the time, I believed — passionately — that teachers and school administrators had wickedly conspired against him top end his job as a teacher. I remember feelings of rage, helplessness, and humiliation over the idea that anyone could take power away from my parents in ways that would make them suffer hardship. That was only the beginning. There was a lot that I know now that I did not understand then. I had a lot of growing up to do. Thus, even though I am weary of revenge narratives, I feel some measure of understanding and sympathy for the deeply wounded young hero of Robert Eggers’s new film The Northman. He too, as a young boy, witnesses his father “removal” from a place of power and influence. He too suffers emotional trauma and lets his fury harden into resentment that becomes a controlling factor in his life. Revenge is foolishness. But that doesn’t mean that stories about it are worthless. Sure, there is an epidemic in American entertainment of stories that glorify revenge — and that’s a toxic trend. But tales of vengeance can follow a righteously angry hero to so many possible conclusions: not only a violent reckoning or ruin, but also grace, forgiveness, reconciliation. I love Lee Isaac Chung’s film Munyurangabo, which I saw a whole decade before he made the Oscar-winning Minari. It’s a powerful story of a revenge quest that leads its angry and heartbroken antihero to a surprising turn. It’s a surprising story that finds hope at the end of a journey that began in trauma and wrath. Such stories are very rare throughout human history. But even if revenge tales end in the achievement of violence, they can become meaningful tragedies. In choosing violence over long-suffering and love, an antihero can illustrate the wages of sin and provide us with a cautionary tale. Consider Hamlet: the choice to answer killing with killing leads to greater consequences for everyone. I’ve always found the prevalence of such violence in mythology interesting — Celtic tales, Greek myths, whatever the origin — for how it illustrates the values and beliefs of particular peoples, places, and times. I first learned about the Norse god Vidar, also known as “The Silent God” and “the God of Revenge,” while paying very little attention during a boring college class on mythology. You want Vidar on your side if you’re on a revenge quest. After all, according to his origin story, Vidar knows the territory: Wreaking vengeance, he tore apart Fenrir, the wolf who had killed his own literal god-father: Odin. But why is Vidar described as a god of silence and revenge? The combination struck me as curious. Was Vidar silent because silence is an essential talent for someone who is determined to sneak up on a dangerous tyrant and kill him? That makes sense — especially if the villain might be anticipating such retaliation. Could it also be that a god of revenge is violent precisely because he is silent about his anger? Bottle up hard feelings and you’ll end up with a volcanic eruption. That’s some heavy wisdom — I’ve learned it from watching others in my family and community. I’ve learned it in my own experience. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that contemporary revenge narratives influence a culture that has such a huge appetite for them. The increasing violence in American culture wars seems to me to be influenced by these stories. Make an audience angry enough, and they will cheer for all manner of violence. And that includes Christian audiences, as evidenced by the popularity of Braveheart among evangelical Christians, and their increasing support for violent uprisings against their culture-war enemies (even though such uprisings are obviously contrary to Jesus’s own teachings). So, I had good reason to approach Eggers’s new movie with skepticism. Reading about the basic narrative arc of The Northman, I became nervous that this might become just a fancier, more enthralling version of the kind of narrative that Quentin Tarantino consistently serves up: a lurid feast appealing to an audience’s bloodlust. And, even more worrying than that — a Nordic revenge story? Right now? A story about clans of white people warring like animals in an endless cycle of violence and retaliation… making speeches about defending their bloodlines? Doesn’t that sound like the glorification of what’s going on all around us in the world right now and threatening not only our hopes for peace and justice but even our hopes of an inhabitable planet for future generations? I admire his two previous films The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2020). Both tell stories of characters who remove themselves from the “trouble” of society (as if that will help). The efforts of those characters fail — as they distance themselves from some sources of trouble, they learn the hard way that they have brought plenty of trouble with them into their isolation. Now, suffering in remote places, they have no community to rely on for help. Even more troubling, both films depict their doomed protagonists devolving into a kind of ecstatic madness, a victory that I don’t believe audiences are meant to believe in or celebrate. I think we’re supposed to recoil at their choices and at the frightful consequences. I interpret both as cautionary tales — or, better, cautionary nightmares — about how our impulses can lead us straight to hell. And I think we are shown that, just the Satan of Milton’s Paradise Lost determines to “make a heaven of hell,” so these characters fail to discern the gravity of their error, thinking they have somehow triumphed. What’s more, I think Eggers’s filmmaking powers are formidable. While both stories strike me as meaningful and worth studying, The Witch and The Lighthouse also look and sound extraordinary, their exquisite aesthetics conjuring a powerful sense of spiritual darkness, their scripts composed with a richly literary complexity, the lines delivered by actors who have mastered difficult dialects. Or is it just another Braveheart, justifying vengeful violence in the name of some kind of god, throwing fuel on the fire of the violent fantasies of the “culture warriors” who threaten democracy? For many moviegoers — perhaps most — The Northman will play like a darker, bloodier version of Gladiator, in which the audience roots for a suffering hero. He never quite says it, but the mantra is there all the same. He might have said “My name is Prince Amleth. You, Fjölnir The Brotherless, killed my father, King Aruvandil War-Raven. Prepare to die.” Instead, he says, “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” We watch Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) gird up his loins and sharpen his lances to carry out violent vengeance against a tyrant (Claes Bang) who took the throne of his father (Ethan Hawke) by treachery, and also made the queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) his own by force. The Northman is basically the ur-Hamlet, a version of classic story that pre-dates any of Shakespeare’s concerns about Ophelia or the role of the Players in “catching the conscience of the king.” This is the most fundamental of revenge quests. This Amleth doesn’t care about wordplay. He devotes his life to the long game of stealth and vengeance, his intent easy readable in the creases of his forehead and the scowl of his posture. Amleth gets a decade-long training in Viking masculinity, complete with  fireside dances and chants, hand-to-hand combat, costumes of animal skins, communion with wolves and with witchcraft (including a Seeress played by none other than the great sorceress of pop music: Bjork!), and with a sort of Crossfit program that involves a lot of rowing. It’s easy to root for him… at first. But there is a strange contradiction at the movie’s heart — manifested in the character of Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). Amleth and Olga form a tenuous bond of mutual support as they earn their way up the chain of slavery to Fjölnir The Brotherless, until they find themselves in  Iceland — Fjölnir has been driven out of his own kingdom and forced to settle elsewhere — at the edge of Fjölnir’s inner circle and family. When they get there, Amleth is troubled to discover that the story he has told himself throughout his life has been a false narrative. Fake News. Those events that traumatized him in childhood, they weren’t as simple as he’d imagined. It wasn’t just a case of the Evil World committing sins against a Saint. Olga, the tender and beautiful slave who sees Amleth’s hardship so clearly, becomes a beacon of wisdom and hope in his life. It’s seems only right that she’s played by Anya Taylor-Joy, the actress who has, in my opinion, eyes that seem to have been custom made for the camera’s attention (yea, more than the eyes of any actor living or dead). Her tremendous, shining eyes give Olga a sense of seeing so much more than Amleth’s narrow and bloodshot eyes ever could. She eventually comes to see a hope for the two of them to break away from the path of violence and find a more meaningful and rewarding life somewhere else. She wants to set Amleth free from the dangers of clinging to the source of his wrath, that false narrative he has believed, that false narrative that he might now see clearly and overcome. Here is an opportunity to show audiences something so much more than — so much better than — the bloody revenge for which so many of them seem to have an insatiable appetite. If I can trust my first experience with the film, I think Olga becomes the movie’s conscience. We embrace Amleth’s doubts, his momentary fear that he might not have any moral high ground to stand on here, as he waves his sword around and challenges his foe. Will Amleth choose to reject the wiser, more complicated understanding of what was really happening in his youth? Will he hold to his original emotional response, as reasonable as it might have been once upon a time, even though he now has a chance to see that it was childish, and that it will only lead to more bloodshed and folly? I think we are supposed to side with Olga in her appeal to dissuade Amleth from his quest. I have a hard time believing that Eggers us to side with Amleth in abandoning a future with his family in favor of the glory of a battle to the death. I think Eggers wants us to see that this is an old, old story, and that today we can be enlightened enough to glimpse a brighter path. So much depends upon how we interpret the film’s closing moments — which I won’t spoil here. They complicate matters significantly, and give those who disagree with me their best evidence.Several of the critics I trust the most are upset about this movie, making strong arguments that it is not only disappointing but dangerous. I completely respect these arguments. So, rather than claim I have “the right reading” of this film, I’m inclined to borrow an expression from Winston Churchill (who was speaking about Russia, not Hamlet, when he said them): Eggers’ film is “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” It’s going to get people talking. But at this point, I do have a different interpretation of the film — particularly because I can’t stop thinking about Eggers’s two previous films. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse give us central characters who “turn to the Dark Side,” so to speak. In their minds and by their chosen values, they triumph — sure. But they do so at the cost of their own souls. At the cost of their souls. I am inclined to argue — only every so slightly, and I’m wide open to being persuaded otherwise — that The Northman is right in step with those films. I believe that Amleth is a tragic figure, one who is deluded into thinking he has triumphed, but from whom we must keep a skeptical distance, refusing to celebrate him as triumphant, horrified by what has become of him and what will probably likely become of his family. His self-affirming vision at the end is not unlike the ecstatic ascension of the young woman possessed at the conclusion of The Witch. In the film’s fiery volcano finale, I couldn’t help but hear the distant echo of Young Obi-Wan’s cry: “You were the chosen one!” Yeah, Amleth might’ve been, if he’d listened. The most heroic figure I know had a singular response to unfathomable evil, and in his response I find hope for an ultimate deliverance. After all, once you have started down the Dark Path, if you don’t seize upon the moments of grace that are offered you, well… as the little green guru says, “forever will it dominate your destiny.” I prefer the Shakespeare version of this story, for the record. It gives us a clearer vision of wisdom and folly. And its truth can set us free.  But I think Eggers’ version will stick with me. Amleth’s dawning realizations about all that he misunderstood in childhood — these resonate with me. Some of the work I am doing now is learning to accept revelations about my childhood that were a long time coming. In a sense, it’s yet another injury, another realization of betrayal. It wasn’t a case of my family being “the Good Guys” and the world around us being “The Bad Guys.” The impulse to draw lines in such a binary fashion is understandable when someone is hurt, but it’s also childish, and it can cause us to take a bad situation and make it far, far worse. I look back at many years of speaking with contempt for those who I believed to be antagonistic toward my family. I look back at the stories I believed, the stories I told myself, and how they hardened into fury and resentment that have probably burned years away from the potential span of my life. The truth is setting me free — but not before the lies (some of which have been self-inflicted) have done a world of damage. I’m grateful for storytellers who have helped me see the cost of vengeful impulses. I’m grateful for the Gospel’s vision of a braver response that can lead to help and healing. Thus, I’ve broken away from the masses that cheer for the fulfillment of revenge quests. Stories of violent heroism always seem like tragedies to me. Violence is cyclical, after all: If you respond to violence with violence, all you’re doing is perpetuating violence in a way that all but guarantees it will continue. Instead of going all Braveheart and raising a weapon in a roaring challenge, Christ receives his enemies’ violence with open arms, suffers it, and refuses to let it remain in the world. In canceling violence, he saves us  from sins. That is the kind of courage and character I find worth celebrating. Amleth is too blinded by rage, and by a perverse cultural milieu of what we now call “toxic masculinity,” to see the better path. And that is why his story is such a tragedy. Hopefully it will be received by audiences for what I believe it is: a memorable, harrowing, cautionary nightmare."
"Jun 26, 2022",POSITIVE," There’s a recurring wave of unease that subsumes much of Robert Eggers’ “The North-man”. Every moment seems to exist on the verge of disruption, as if ephemerality is baked into the structure. And so, we gain excitement from watching chaos manifested. Ruptures and disruption are critical to what is at work here, so much so that the first image of the film is a volcanic eruption that envelopes the screen. Danger is imminent. And of course, it is. This is a miserable and punishing world. How wonderful, then, that for all the cruel misery at work “The Northman” feels propulsive and exciting even as we work our way, methodically, to inevitable areas of tragedy and despair. This world might be miserable, but the filmmaking on display is energising and exciting. Eggers’ film, co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón, is based on the legend of Amleth (our hero) by Saxo Gramma-ticus, a tale of Norse mythology that is more readily remembered as the source for Shake-speare’s “Hamlet”. Although, thinking of “The Northman” as a Viking version of Hamlet misses out some of the specific weirdness that feels endemic to Eggers’ work as a filmmaker over his three-film oeuvre. Whether implicit, or explicit, Shakespeare remains an influential figure in film over the last two centuries and Eggers variation on the very familiar tale of the embittered son avenging the name of his dead father is one that feels innately familiar. But nothing in Eggers’ approach to this story feels familiar or banal. I spent a lot of “The Northman” remembering how dull I found so much of the approach to the narrative in Joel Coen’s “The Tragedy of Macbeth” earlier this year. Of course, Coen was working with a more straightforward adaptation of that particular play but the most telling attitude of Eggers’ take on the angry vengeance at the root of his film (a similar emotion that is essential for “Macbeth”) feels tactile and visceral in a way that resists any notions of austerity, remoteness or reticence. Eggers’ approach is confrontational. He demands our attention and then plays with our senses, bringing “The Northman” to climax after climax that challenges our perception of this world. A brief prelude, where we meet the young Amleth and learn about the dynamics of this world, effectively establishes this this tactility. Jarin Blaschke’s camera moves through the shadowy castle in a way that makes even the most regal parts of this world look grimy and uncomfortable. So, we meet Nicole Kidman’s Queen Gudrún, who is imposing and fearsome as much as she is beautiful and beguiling. Her energy provides an intriguing dynamic with Ethan Hawke’s weary King Aurvandill, who offers a paternalistic countenance that feels warm but ambiguous enough for Amleth to spend the rest of the film wishing to avenge him. King Aurvandill’s murder is an early highpoint that confirms Eggers willingness to confront the magnetic violence at the heart of this world. The camera does not avert its gaze, but confronts us with unbridled brutality. Young Amleth’s flight from the scene is a wonderful sequence as the film moves from the past into the present in a mesmerising bit of camerawork. “The Northman” is winningly engaging at every turn, and is best when it becomes an unabashed technical marvel. It’s definitely Eggers’ least actor-focused script, so within that it’s no surprise that the most effective turns are by actors from who we know have always been able to do the most with the least. Hawke’s paternal gaiety commands the first sections, Willem Dafoe’s manic energy lingers long after we see him last and – of course – Kidman .in a film overwhelmed by competing versions of masculinity, offers a sly and confident performance that’s punctuated by her eyes darting in the background in every scene – contemplating, if not always commenting on, the action around her. Each performer feels more interesting when opposite her. It is a role that in truth feels too brief but effectively teases the promise that is manifested in a late scene with Skarsgård that improbably ends up feeling like the highpoint of a film with so many eclectic fight-sequences. But, everyone is good, even if limited by the parameters of the film, which sees these characters less as individualised figures and more as part of a fabric of hate, vengeance and brutality that this Viking world is built on. In this way, it lacks the unpredictable looseness of “The Lighthouse” (Eggers’ best film) but offers a clarity of vision that retains the kind of technical specificity that is so key to his work so far. What I find most compelling about “The Northman” is the way it recognises the cruel brutality of this world and the angry malfeasance of humanity but still feels exciting and exhilarating and that, for me, is the most significant aspect. There is a consistent propulsive energy at work in “The Northman” that is its best asset. How strange that a film that is so full of the most miserable aspects of human nature feels so energetic. For all the death and blood and gore, “The Northman” offers the kind of visceral thrills that feel tapped into the full aesthetic parameters of what cinema can offer. It’s one of the highlights of 2022 thus far."
"Jun 24, 2022",POSITIVE," Satanic goats don't talk in The Northman. Heartthrobs don't masturbate while fondling mermaid figurines, either. Still, within ten minutes, pre-teen Viking prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, The Batman), his glory-seeking warrior father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke, Moon Knight) and jester-meets-shaman Heimir (Willem Dafoe, Nightmare Alley) descend into a fire-lit cave to take hallucinogens, growl, grunt, bark like wolves and fart like it's a god-given superpower. If viewers didn't know who's behind this bold, brutal, brilliant, and blood- and guts-strewn Scandinavian opus before then, there's no doubt from this trippy scene onwards: after The Witch and The Lighthouse, writer/director Robert Eggers' touch, approach and style have become that distinctive just three remarkable features into his helming career. As he first demonstrated with his potent pilgrim horror movie, then doubled down on with his mesmerising oceanside nightmare, Eggers crafts chaotic celluloid dreams about faith- and sanity-stretching dances with madness and mania. He makes features so striking that they're haunting, rippling with the devotedly realistic and the hypnotically occult in tandem. Eggers' work isn't merely meticulously tense and atmospheric; it proves blisteringly visceral to the point of feeling inescapably tangible. Indeed, his steadfast commitment to authenticity spirits the whole concept of immersive filmmaking high into movie Valhalla. See: the vivid period-appropriate detail in The Northman's Nordic villages, which'd only be more evocative if they'd time-travelled in from the ninth and tenth centuries. Sense: the entrancing swirl that springs from all of the above, complete with Eggers' unfailing idiosyncrasies. Experience: the sublime tussle with myth, fantasy and folklore that results, as it has in each of his features, to both plunge into and interrogate his history-set reveries. In this untamed and laid-bare portrait of the past, something is rotten in the state of Iceland — as it was in Denmark via William Shakespeare, and in the Pride Lands of Africa in both versions of The Lion King. Writing The Northman's screenplay with poet, novelist and Björk collaborator Sjón (Lamb), Eggers takes his cues not from Hamlet, however, but from the Old Norse legend of Amleth that inspired the iconic tragedy. The narrative still involves a son anointed to be the future king, a tragedy that shatters his regal family, and a dastardly uncle who gets murderous to seize the throne and his brother's wife, of course. And, it keeps following its protagonist as he wages a determined odyssey of feral revenge against the man who reshaped his fate so ruthlessly. ""I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir."" That's Amleth's vow as a boy on a north Atlantic island in 895 when he witnesses the latter's (Claes Bang, Locked Down) treachery. He flees after hearing his uncle bay for his head, too, and seeing him carry off Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, Being the Ricardos) as a spoil of his victory. Two decades later, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, Succession) is a hulking, wolfskin-clad Viking berserker, living life flinging whatever weaponry he can find while viciously pillaging through the lands of the Rus. But amid the bloodlust, gore and piling-up body count, the intense marauder is thrust back onto his vengeance-seeking path. A Slavic seeress (Björk, in her first film role since 2005) whispers stark truths about his current savagery and lapsed mission against Fjölnir, reigniting his yearning for that promised slaughter — and the single-minded behemoth learns that his uncle is now sheep-farming in Iceland, having lost the kingdom in another coup. A line from Hamlet comes to mind: ""now could I drink hot blood"". By the time Amleth brands himself to pass as a prisoner of war, slips onto a slave ship and ensures he's among the new captives at Fjölnir's ranch, he's already literally done just that. But his thirst for honouring his father, rescuing his mother and slaying his uncle remains unquenched, and he soon has help from and the heart of fellow servant Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, who scored her big break with The Witch alongside Eggers). How that quest eventuates won't surprise anyone familiar with the Bard, but The Northman still astonishes again and again. As only visionary filmmakers can, Eggers refuses to take any expected turn or make a single predictable move even while playing with a plot that's long spilled its thrills across popular culture, and while slashing into a genre — Viking epics — that's rarely far from screens. High among The Northman's joys and wonders, both large and small, sits its cast — with Skarsgård fulfilling a decade-plus journey from playing True Blood vampire Eric Northman to both starring in and producing this, which he's been trying to bring to fruition for just as long. His muscular power and presence as the epitome of rage and revenge is pulsating, not to mention physically commanding, and buying Amleth as the lacerating spirit of both a wolf and a bear is one of the easiest things about the film. His Big Little Lies co-star Kidman also turns in a ferocious performance, and the pair's evolution from that TV hit's husband-and-wife dynamic to this flick's unhinged mother-and-son duo drips with the requisite Oedipal creepiness. Elsewhere, Bang does brooding villainy like he's born to it, as he showed in Dracula; 22 years after playing Hamlet himself, Hawke delivers a 20-minute supporting-player masterclass; and the inimitable Taylor-Joy ensures that no one else could ever be pictured in her pivotal part. Plus, that Eggers finds small roles for The Witch's Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson doesn't go unnoticed. A ravaging rampage of a film — a movie beating with unshakeable fury, as metal a Viking saga that's ever likely to be made, and equally thunderous and off-kilter — Eggers' best feature yet wouldn't be what it is without its weight and spectacle, though. It's a picture of brusque poetry in its dialogue, its curt lines laden with importance but never trite (Amleth's stated juggling act to find ""kindness for my kin and hate for my enemies"" included). It's a work of elemental potency in its sweepingly shot imagery, with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (a veteran of all three of the director's films) painting with light, the stunning landscapes, and the wind, rain, snow, mud, fire and ash that lurks upon it. That's true in the head-splitting game of Knattleikr that makes just one primal centrepiece, the climactic naked volcano sword fight and the many supernatural-laced sights in-between. And, it all contributes to a breathtaking cinematic onslaught that savvily turns hellishness into movie heaven — all without shying away from the costs and sacrifices of Amleth's crusade; serving up a simplistic revenge fantasy; or excusing, glorifying or downplaying the relentless violence that informs every moment."
"Jun 19, 2022",POSITIVE," Cada vez somos más voces —incluida la mía— las que, puede que en una señal de senectud prematura, ponen el grito en el cielo mientras se llevan las manos a la cabeza frente a un presunto estado de la industria cinematográfica actual en el que la creatividad y el riesgo, o bien parecen haber muerto a favor de las franquicias y las fórmulas, o han quedado desterradas a las profundidades de los gigantescos y laberínticos catálogos de las plataformas de streaming. Pero, en medio de lo que parece ser un cambio radical en la tendencia de los hábitos de consumo, producción y distribución, aún quedan autores y compañías que continúan arriesgando y llevando a las salas de cine títulos que, en pleno 2022, casi podrían ser considerados como pequeños milagros. Sin ir más lejos, el estreno de 'X' de Ti West está a la vuelta de la esquina, pero la muestra más reciente de esta suerte de résistance fílmica es la descomunal épica vikinga 'El hombre del norte'.  Después de enamorar —más en el circuito de festivales que entre el público tradicional, todo sea dicho— con su excepcional debut 'La bruja' y esa pesadilla febril monócroma titulada 'El faro', Robert Eggers ha vuelto a la carga con una nueva rareza en la que terror, venganza y mitología nórdica se dan la mano en uno de los espectáculos más sugestivos y viscerales que hemos podido disfrutar en la gran pantalla durante los últimos años. Todo aquél que esté familiarizado con la obra previa de Eggers podrá intuir de buenas a primeras que 'El hombre del norte' no es, en absoluto, un filme convencional. Una vez más, el natural de New Hampshire ha vuelto a manifestar su enorme pasión por los grandes cineastas europeos al filtrar las bases narrativas y conceptuales de 'Conan el Bárbaro' a través del prisma de leyendas como Carl Theodor Dreyer, Werner Herzog —es complicado no pensar en su 'Aguirre'— o el Tarkovski de 'Andrei Rublev'. Aunque los avances publicados hasta la fecha puedan invitar a pensar en una orgía de violencia, espadazos y vendetta a la escandinava —elementos que están presentes, y en no pocas cantidades—, la cinta se revela mucho más interesada en representar a fuego lento el folclore de la zona mientras lo introduce bajo la piel del espectador abrazando códigos propios del horror y sin titubear al apostar por lo onírico; generando una atmósfera tan magnética como malsana y enrarecida. Si estas pretensiones resultan tan satisfactorias es, en buena parte, gracias a un tratamiento formal excepcional y, a su manera, hermoso, que podría invitar a pensar en una alternativa multimillonaria a la magnífica 'Valhalla Rising' de Nicholas Winding Refn. El mimo volcado en la planificación y la puesta en escena por parte de Eggers se combina una vez más con la dirección de fotografía de Jardin Blaschke —su DOP de cabecera—, que imprime sobre 35mm instantáneas inolvidables; incluyendo unos primeros planos arrebatadores rodados con lentes Petzval. Por desgracia, el talento desbordante que destila cada una de sus escenas, la visceralidad que envuelve su trama y el brillante modo en que se traslada a la pantalla no será fácil de digerir para todo el mundo, en parte, gracias a unos tráilers que ponen toda la carne en el asador obviando un tono y una cadencia que poco tienen en común con Schwarzenegger desmembrando enemigos en la mencioanda joya de John Milius. No obstante, quien se entregue sin prejuicios a los muchos placeres que ofrece 'El hombre del norte' descubrirá una de esas obras únicas y en peligro de extinción condenadas, injustamente, a pegarse un batacazo tremendo en taquilla."
"Jun 19, 2022",POSITIVE," THE CONTRACTOR (2022). A standard operating procedure is employed by The Contractor, a military-minded thriller with nary a novel idea in its stridently routine screenplay. Chris Pine headlines as James Harper, a Special Forces sergeant who’s involuntary discharged from the Army after the use of contraband drugs to treat his battle-earned injuries. Cruelly deprived of his pension, he’s encouraged by his best friend (Ben Foster) to take a high-paying job with an underground military outfit run by a no-nonsense veteran (Kiefer Sutherland). James is assigned to eliminate a scientist (Fares Fares) with ties to ISIS, only to learn that he’s been misled by the ostensible good guys who of course now want him terminated as well. Pine and Foster, who played brothers in 2016’s excellent Hell or High Water, now co-star as brothers-in-arms, but, like pretty much everything else in this drab undertaking, there’s nothing fresh or noteworthy about their characters or their performances. The only character of note is Virgil, the lonely caretaker of a remote safe house — Eddie Marsan makes us feel the weight of this man’s haunting memories and crushing isolation, and it’s a shame that the part is so small. Director Tarik Saleh effectively stages a couple of shootouts, but that’s not enough to save this otherwise inert actioner. THE GUILTY (1947) / HIGH TIDE (1947). As with Repeat Performance (reviewed last week), the Flicker Alley label has teamed with the Film Noir Foundation and the UCLA Film & Television Archive to revive and restore two more noirs from 1947 and lovingly bring them to Blu-ray and DVD. Whereas Repeat Performance was a standalone title, The Guilty and High Tide have been released in a double feature edition. Cornell Woolrich, the prolific mystery writer adored by both Hollywood and François Truffaut (adaptations include Rear Window, The Window, Phantom Lady, and The Bride Wore Black), found his short story “Two Men in a Furnished Room” transformed into the decent “B” flick The Guilty. Bonita Granville, a former child actress best known for starring as Nancy Drew in the late-‘30s film series, plays twin sisters — one good and one bad, of course — who become involved with testy roommates Mike (Don Castle) and Johnny (Wally Cassell). When one of the siblings is murdered and all evidence points to Johnny, Mike takes it upon himself to find the real killer. The ending is sure to catch many viewers by surprise. Even better is High Tide, which opens with a car crash that has pinned down both private eye Tim Slade (Castle) and newspaper editor Hugh Fresney (Lee Tracy). As the pair eye the rising waters that will eventually drown them, the movie enters flashback mode and shows how they got to this point. It’s a twisty tale that paints Fresney as a crusader unafraid of the mobsters who rule the city and Slade as the former reporter who’s roped into this mess by his ex-boss. There are two sets of potential love triangles with some Venn diagram overlapping, a shocking murder within the newspaper building, a role for character actor Regis Toomey, who played a detective in The Guilty and plays one here as well, and, as with The Guilty, a surprise villain. Tracy, often cast as newspapermen (as in the 1932 pre-Code chiller Doctor X), gives one of his best performances as the wily editor who never slows down. Extras consist of film historian audio commentary on both titles; introductions to both movies by film historian and noir expert Eddie Muller; featurettes on Jack Wrather and John Reinhardt, respectively the producer and director of both films; and separate pieces on Woolrich and Tracy. A booklet is also included. THE HORSE SOLDIERS (1959). It sounds like a piece of trivia that can’t possibly be correct: Over the course of his career, one largely defined by his Westerns, John Ford only directed one feature focusing on the Civil War. (He also tackled the War Between the States in 1963’s How the West Was Won, but that was just one segment in a multipart movie.) It’s a shame, then, that The Horse Soldiers doesn’t rank more highly in his oater oeuvre: It’s beautifully photographed (by William Clothier) and contains some rousing set-pieces, but it’s hindered by thinly drawn characters and a scarcely believable romance. Based on an actual incident, this stars John Wayne as Colonel Marlowe, a Union officer tasked with leading a raid deep into Confederate territory. Strictly militaristic in thought and deed, he butts heads with Major Kendall (William Holden), the outfit’s doctor and a man disgusted with every aspect of war. Marlowe and Kendall are painted in broad strokes — unusual for a John Ford production — and the story grows convoluted when the group is forced to take along a Southern belle (Constance Towers) who has overheard their plans. Naturally, she and Marlowe begin as enemies and end as sweethearts. The Horse Soldiers is the third Civil War flick to hit Blu-ray within the past 12 months, but it’s not as exciting as Major Dundee or as complex as Shenandoah. LAST PASSENGER (2013). Here’s a pleasant surprise, an under-the-radar thriller that’s been largely undiscovered for nearly a decade now. In the tradition of Steven Spielberg’s Duel, it features an unseen force of evil at the controls of a vehicular instrument of destruction — in this case, it’s a train rather than a truck. A late-night train leaving London is carrying only six passengers when it becomes obvious that something isn’t right: The ticket-taker is missing and scheduled stops are being bypassed. Lewis (Dougray Scott), a widowed doctor traveling with his young son (Joshua Kaynama), sets out to investigate, alternately helped and hindered by the other passengers: a lovely event coordinator (Kara Tointon), an impertinent businessman (David Schofield), a testy London Underground worker (Iddo Goldberg), and a kindly grandmother (Lindsay Duncan). Writer-director Omid Nooshin immediately primes himself for success by creating interesting and well-rounded characters who hold our attention even before the thriller aspect makes its first appearance. Scott, forever known as The Man Who Would Be Wolverine (he was cast in the X-Men role before delays tied to his Mission: Impossible 2 involvement forced him to drop out), and Tointon make an appealing couple, and Nooshin doesn’t skimp on putting his protagonists through some hair-raising situations. THE NORTHMAN (2022). Writer-director Robert Eggers, at the helm of his third motion picture following 2016’s The Witch and the 2019 10 Best entry The Lighthouse, takes on Hamlet before it was Hamlet. Working primarily from a legend largely brought to light by 12th-century Danish author Saxo Grammaticus — a medieval saga that directly inspired Shakespeare to pen his magnum opus — Eggers and co-scripter Sjón have created a ferocious revenge tale that’s heavy on the blood and sweat but light on the tears. It tells the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, who also produced), an Icelandic warrior seeking vengeance against the uncle (Claes Bang) who murdered his father (a miscast Ethan Hawke) and took off with his mother (Nicole Kidman). To get close to his target, Amleth disguises himself as a slave, an action that puts him in the same company as a captured sorceress (Anya Taylor-Joy) who shares many of his goals. The Northman is a rousing Viking yarn where the supernatural easily commingles with reality, a world in which witches and seers carry as much weight as kings and queens. It’s an absolutely immersive experience, with Eggers and team offering an up-close-and-personal seat to a searing, soaring spectacle. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by Eggers; a making-of featurette; deleted and extended scenes; and a look at Knattleikr, the violent game prominently featured in one exciting sequence. THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1998). There have been many screen versions of the Gaston Leroux novel (including the Universal classics with Lon Chaney and Claude Rains and the Hammer not-so-classic with Herbert Lom), as well as many take-offs and knock-offs (among them the imaginative Phantom of the Paradise and the idiotic Phantom of the Mall: Eric’s Revenge). I daresay Dario Argento’s interpretation might be the worst of them all, and, yes, I’ve seen the version starring Freddy Krueger as the Phantom. Co-written by Argento and frequent Roman Polanski collaborator Gérard Brach (Tess, The Fearless Vampire Killers), this gonzo picture takes plenty of bold chances, but when not a single one works, what’s the point? Here, the opera-house dweller isn’t a physical grotesquerie but a handsome man (Julian Sands, boring beyond belief) who, not unlike the abandoned baby raised by penguins in Batman Returns, was an abandoned baby lovingly raised by rats. Possessing telepathic(!) abilities, he develops a rapport with opera singer Christine Daaé (Asia Argento, awful beyond compare), who falls in love with both the Phantom and with suitor Raoul (Andrea Di Stefano, stiff beyond imagining). The bloodletting should please the gore-galore crowd; others will want to steer clear of the wreckage. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981). This dream project between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas is one of the all-time greats, a delightful thrill-a-minute flick in the grand swashbuckling and movie serial traditions. Harrison Ford is perfection-plus as Indiana Jones, so iconic a character that the AFI cited him as the second greatest movie hero of all time (just under Atticus Finch and just above James Bond) in its 2003 “100 Heroes & Villains” list. Every character is richly brought to life, particularly Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, Paul Freeman’s Belloq (a frequently underrated villain), and, oh, yeah, that treacherous capuchin monkey. Nominated for eight Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director for Spielberg), it nabbed four statues for its film editing, visual effects, sets, and sound, as well as a Special Achievement Award for sound effects editing. Raiders of the Lost Ark made its 4K debut last summer as part of the Indiana Jones 4-Movie Collection. It’s now being offered as a standalone 4K feature in a new Steelbook edition that includes no extras but does contain a digital code and a mini-poster. The three sequels will likewise be released individually, with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arriving July 12, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade out August 16, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull due September 20. THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). While films about labor disputes between unions and management sound about as exciting as HOA board meetings, the truth is that there have been some solid dramas to emerge from this subgenre. Joining the likes of Martin Ritt’s Norma Rae and John Sayles’ Matewan is this all-but-forgotten film that was shot on location in New Hampshire. When the benevolent owner (Donald McKee) of a plastics company dies in an airplane crash, his widow (silent-cinema star Dorothy Gish in one of her few talkies) takes over and immediately promotes the likable Brad Adams (Lloyd Bridges) to supervisor, figuring he can serve as an effective bridge between the company, the union, and the factory workers positioned between the pair. But when Brad realizes that the only way to save the company from going under is to lay off half the employees, he quickly becomes persona non grata with his co-workers. With the writing credited to six individuals (including the gent who receives the unusual billing of “an original story suggested and developed from the research of”), this turns out to be a thoughtful picture with no easy answers (at least until the happy ending), and the supporting cast includes up-and-comers Ernest Borgnine, Murray Hamilton, Anne Francis, and Carleton Carpenter (who passed away this past January at the age of 95)."
"Jun 9, 2022",POSITIVE," A legitimate roller coaster ride, a love letter to watching a movie through the slots in your fingers because the frenzy at times can be just too much to bear (in the best way possible). Only a delightful sicko like Bay could direct something like this; that ambulance surgery scene is seared into my brain. COVID Rear Window. Steven Soderbergh is one of the most talented director from his generation if only because he can quite literally direct anything, any genre, at any time. The protest/van scene and the “Sabotage” sequence made me yell aloud in excitement. One of the best movies of the year; watching this and The Northman back-to-back was a hell of a way to spend a Monday. Well, this is much better than The Crimes of Grindelwald, one of the worst studio blockbusters I’ve seen in the last 10 years, and when it actually focuses on the beasts, it’s a fun time. Jude Law was an excellent Dumbledore pick, and he understands the assignment. Dan Fogler is always a hoot in these movies and really seems invested in the character, and Mads Mikkelsen is just such an improvement over [REDACTED]. The problem is that even the good stuff here feels wholly unnecessary. The first film in the series did a good enough job of actually living up to its promise, but trying to shoehorn the Dumbledore/Grindelwald saga in this series just was the wrong decision. That needed its own movie without trying to tie itself down. I quite enjoyed this for what it was, but I’m just unsure we really need another one of these movies. I’d be much more obliged to watch it after this one as opposed to that awful second film. It just all feels like content over cinema; something recognizable, something occasionally fun and compelling, just never … needed. Where the hell was all the love for this when it came out? Just a sleek, purposefully messy chamber piece heightened by Rylance chewing every bit of scenery and a really tight, purposeful script. The type of movie that would’ve done better in 2005, methinks. It helps that Dylan O’Brien, Zoey Deutch and Johnny Flynn are among the best in their young class of underappreciated actors. Graham Moore is a guy I’ve got high hopes for. It’s been a minute since we’ve had a nice little mob drama like this. Tom Cruise is the greatest movie star of all time. I think this settles the debate. He’s a weird cat, but the man understands the theatrical experience probably better than any actor to ever live. He’s created some of the most thrilling works ever, and pushes the limits every time into what he can do. There have been some greats, but Cruise is the king. He’s the best that ever was or will be. This is stellar. Top Gun: Maverick feels like The Irishman for blockbusters, with the criticism going much more outward than inward. If you’d like to ask Tom Cruise about his opinion on the state of studio filmmaking, here’s your answer. …so I think I know what answer he gave Marvel? It’s right up there with Creed and Star Wars: The Force Awakens for bombastic legacyquels, but it feels much more like the former in pushing the craft forward and in the latter in just delivering everything you were hoping for. A perfect blend of both approaches. All-time movie theater experience; one of the great sequels, too. A modest, intriguing little crime drama that lets Jesse Plemons kind of take over for stretches and do his thing, which I always approve of. Not sure if it fully lands that ending, but I really enjoyed the ride. FWIW: Nicolas Cage didn’t have to make this for folks to celebrate his talent (blessedly, we did that last year with Pig, and in 2018 with Mandy). This, at least to me, would’ve worked better as a Funny or Die short, but Cage and Pedro Pascal as BFFs is fun enough to help cover up the uninteresting plot. This isn’t the shocking satirical introspection into a generational actor/enigma it kind of billed itself to be, more an SNL-style movie where a man plays a meme. Cage is always game for whatever the script throws at him; I just wish they’d thrown more? It’s a lukewarm effort, but likable enough to sand over a very uninspired plot. You could legit do without all of the CIA stuff. Just cut it out. It is just empty air. The memorabilia scene is good. I wish the movie had been more of that. The Paddington 2 scene…I think it’s still too early to reference Paddington 2 in other movies. That’s just me, though. You do you. Phil Tippett spending 30 or so years to make this is a hell of a thing. More of a sensory experience than anything, but a punishing one, bent on pulling you into the depths of Tippett’s inferno. I wouldn’t last 5 minutes in this hellhole he imagined. I think that’s the point. Stunning imagery, blistering tone, downright horrifying in spurts, bleakly humorous in others. I really hope Tippett watched a lot of Seinfeld while he made this, or took a lot of really calm walks by the beach. This movie needed some Paddington 2 jokes, not The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. It’d be funny to me if they played this for a crowded theater full of kids instead of Minions: The Rise of Gru. Mad God…for the whole family! Not bad! Not quite among Eastwood’s best, but a very entertaining and well-made courtroom drama with some unexpected personality. It’s a damn shame Kevin Spacey is a criminal because he’s quite good in this and usually everything he does. John Cusack is also a fascinating foil, but I genuinely have no idea what type of journalist or writer he was and what his ethical boundaries were. Writing a book might open him up a bit to be more friendly with the subject, but if he’s an actual journalist, this is a crash course in how not to cover something. Nevertheless, a really good watch! It has its flaws, but it’s Eastwood, and the Lady Chablis (RIP) alone makes up for most of the slips-ups. What a performance! Bummed she didn’t get a chance to do more in the movies. Respect always to my Uncle Bobby for taking me to see this when I was 11. My brother was 9, and he was there, too. Special night! My mom had no idea. The “Luck of the Irish” gag is still to this day one of the funniest things from that absurdly great 00s comedy run, capped without peer by that Joel David Moore “that’s how he wanted to go out” line. I mean, you can’t do it better. The way he sells it, and the look on the guy next to him. The Lance Armstrong gag and like … okay let’s be real 15% of the very dated/probably offensive jokes you could do without. Outside of that, always one of the best studio comedies of its time during a time when studios actually made comedies. What a concept! I don’t want to be some sort of jackass and try to act like I know what happened in this movie because obviously *I have no idea,* but I’m pretty sure it’s about people who can’t let go of the past to the point where they become stuck there and can’t leave. So basically the Eagles watched this, said ‘wait a second,’ and wrote “Hotel California.” It’s also got the world’s most amped-up organ player going HAM on every stanza."
"Jun 8, 2022",POSITIVE,Gratuitously extenuating retina trips... A nightmare in its own right that portrays the tragedy and the end of a treacherous and ultra-masculinized world. [Full review in Spanish] 
"Jun 8, 2022",POSITIVE," In 914 AD, a young Amleth (Oscar Novak) bears witness to the betrayal of all he knows. His father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) is slaughtered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who claims his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) as his own. Narrowly escaping the odds against him, he is accepted by a neighboring Viking tribe, growing powerful under a personal vow of vengeance. When the adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) learns from a fallen seeress (Björk) his opportunity is at hand, the warrior disguises himself as a slave to fulfill his destiny, befriending Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) to aid him in his dire task. Biding his time to ensure a vengeance true to his word, revelations come to light as Amleth’s relationship with Olga grows, leaving him torn between what he is sworn to do and the potential rewards of abandoning his oath. Writer / director Robert Eggers has grand ideas, a visual style, and a healthy preoccupation with legend, morality tales, and mysticism. His freshman film The VVitch (also starring Anya Taylor-Joy) was well-received but met with mixed audience reaction, similar to his followup The Lighthouse (also starring Willem Dafoe who appears in The Northman as Heimir The Fool). With his latest film steeped in the old legends that also inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet — and some would add Disney’s The Lion King — Eggers soaks his production in destiny, ritual, and testosterone. Channeling a modern Conan the Barbarian mixed with bits of “Game of Thrones” and The 13th Warrior (which also draws from Beowulf), The Northman might be the director’s most mainstream film to date, but can it find an audience eager for its spectacle? Iceland is the backdrop for the old world of The Northman in the same way New Zealand became Middle-Earth for The Lord of the Rings; the sweeping expanse and wide spaces make this intimate epic feel larger and more affecting than it should and serves the story well. Some scenes appear almost black and white beneath gray overcast skies until interrupted by a flicker of firelight or a splash of blood, but not to the extreme of stylized films like 300 or Sin City. Eggers keeps everything grounded and practical as safely allowed. Alexander Skarsgård has stepped up his game, both in acting and training to look the part; it’s an amusing coincidence  it also feels like a potential backstory for his character Erik Northman on HBO’s “True Blood” series. The director has crafted an immersive experience that is decidedly adult, telling a classic tale as well as it can be told with a flare for the dramatic and death as a constant companion. Earning its running time of just over two hours, it boasts a single moment of amusement and a lifetime of satisfaction. Half of the top-listed cast makes only a brief appearances, although the way Willem Dafoe’s character is given extra screen time is as ghastly as it is wonderful. Nicole Kidman lends her craft to bring another matriarch to life, exceeding her similar role in Aquaman. Anya Taylor-Joy is ethereal as always, playing Olga as more aware than everyone thinks and smart enough to hide it from her enemies. The Northman’s world is built upon men ruling and women wanting… unless they’re the cunning kind of woman who learn to elevate their station, the queens and spiritualists who survive those seated upon thrones. Beastly warriors, assassinated kings, and soothsaying seers look down upon a brutal landscape where the common person could be free one moment and conquered the next with little to say in how their fate will play out.  With outlandish war preparations and coming-of-age scenes ready-made for after-hour Renaissance festival drum circles, Eggers goes all-in with his low-fantasy Dungeons & Dragons settings. The spectacle of it makes for great storytelling, but the plot hinges on the idea that “this is not the way,” punctuated with a father’s admission that one doesn’t know each day whether they’ll awaken as a king or a slave, and it’s best to be prepared for both. Because Robert Eggers has since announced his desire to tackle Nosferatu, sadly, we must wait."
"Jun 7, 2022",POSITIVE,"While The Northman isn't, in the end, as wholly perfect as Eggers debut The VVitch, he's still three-for-three and more ambitious each time he gets behind the camera. "
"Jun 7, 2022",POSITIVE," “The Northman” underwent an intense series of reshoots last year, this after politely received test screenings put a damper on the possibility of it being released in 2021. Eggers’ third feature has had a somewhat problematic journey thus far. What we have here is an ambitious and massive film that is said to have a $90 million budget. Its screenplay was co-written by Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón Sigurdsson, but the ambiguously spooky storytelling of Eggers’ earlier films is replaced with a more mainstream approach here. That’s perfectly fine. This isn’t the kind of movie that will break any sort of cinematic mold, but it’s rousingly entertaining stuff. Watch it on the big screen with a large audience, if you can. “Never discount a true filmmaker, even with studio interference. “The Northman” runs 140 minutes and I was never bored, and that means something these days. It feels, obviously, very familiar, as it’s based on the legend of Amleth, which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, but it’s incredibly well–directed.” “What “The Northman” lacks is the artful ambiguity of Eggers’ first two films, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse”. The influence of studio notes is apparent throughout.” “But it’s not that much of a slog, and despite a little too much CG with a climax happening at the mouth of an active volcano, two naked men fighting, not the best endin, Hollywood doesn’t really make epics of this kind anymore.“ “You can tell Eggers wanted a more elevated, visually-driven movie but the reshoots made it more ‘entertaining.’ Hopefully a director’s cut shows up someday, more of a pure Eggers version. The off-the-top influences are “Hamlet”, “Gladiator” and Game of Thrones”. “Alexander Skarsgaard’s lead performance is stellar. Ethan Hawke, as Skarsgaard’s murdered king-father, is in the film for maybe 10 minutes. Nicole Kidman, Hawke’s wife-queen, has a few scenes (her screen time comes to roughly 20 minutes) that she just nails. Anya Taylor Joy cuts a vivid figure, but a terrible accent.” “How many heads are split open with axes? I’d say about a dozen. The killings are extremely brutal. A fair amount of intestine spilling. There’s some kind of nod to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, he reports, and the skull of Yorick makes an appearance.”"
"Jun 3, 2022",NEGATIVE," Borges, el hombre que sabía todo de los libros, aunque confesara haber cometido el mayor de los pecados, o sea, no haber sido feliz, declaró muchas veces su amor y admiración incondicionales a las leyendas escandinavas y a las sagas islandesas. Imperdonablemente las desconozco. Imagino que el coguionista y el director de El hombre del norte las han devorado. Y, por supuesto, han leído a un tal Shakespeare, la persona que mejor ha descrito con palabras lo que ocurre en el cerebro y en el corazón de la gente. En esta película existe eco no solo de personajes como Hamlet. También de Macbeth y Ricardo III. Al servicio de una historia con pretensiones de espectáculo, de llevar a los cines al gran público, algo que solo consigue últimamente ese cine tan vacuo, bobo, clónico, fabricado por computadora, que lleva el sello de la factoría Marvel. Lleva la firma del director estadounidense Robert Eggers, avalado con prestigio crítico, aunque no entienda los motivos, ya que su aclamada El faro me pareció una tontería pretenciosa, inútilmente retorcida, complacientemente violenta, insoportable. En El hombre del norte la violencia no es psicológica, sino ante todo física, incluyendo más de una imagen de gente con los intestinos colgando. La venganza obsesiva protagoniza su temática. La que planea un hombre, cuyo padre, rey de Islandia, fue asesinado por su felón y traidor hermano cuando él era un crío. Y también se casó con la viuda. A lo largo de dos horas, que no me resultan aburridas, pero tampoco apasionantes, este ser prematuramente destrozado sobrevive duramente como esclavo, con el único fin de matar al que causó su desdicha. También aspira a liberar a su madre de la persona que destrozó a su familia. Pero habrá sorpresas con poder alucinatorio para el vengador. El pasado está lleno de aristas. Y se agradece el giro perverso del guion. La sórdida realidad huye de lo que podría ser adecuado o convencional. El hombre del norte posee cierta fuerza visual, también un ritmo adecuado a la brutalidad que están describiendo. Puedes acabar saturado de tantas peleas, del desparrame de vísceras, de enfrentamientos feroces. Todo es primitivo y salvaje. Miembros cercenados, sangre interminable, gritos y aullidos. Con el alivio de una historia de amor con presente tan crudo como pocas esperanzas de futuro. Al sombrío protagonista lo encarna el chico de moda, Alexander Skarsgård, hijo de ese actor modélico y sobrio llamado Stellan Skarsgård. Por ahora, prefiero al padre. Y aunque resulten inicialmente irreconocibles, también aparecen secundarios de lujo, como Willem Dafoe, Ethan Hawke y la enigmática Björk, haciendo lógicamente de bruja. Pero el trabajo que más me convence es el de la siempre creíble actriz Nicole Kidman. Su careto lleva mucho tiempo alterado o tieso por el comprensible terror al envejecimiento, pero su talento permanece intacto, haciendo de buena o de mala. Al llegar a mi casa vuelvo a ver, después de mucho tiempo, la deliciosa La princesa prometida. No es casual. Como El hombre del norte, habla de una venganza, plagada de duelos entre espadachines, peleas, personajes pintorescos, una historia de amor que el destino no pudo quebrar. Todo es de broma, con el humor y la ironía protagonizando situaciones graciosas y delirantes, con capacidad para captar la atención y la pasión de un crío enfermo al que su abuelo le lee un libro. Todo es imaginativo e inteligente en esta preciosa película, empezando por el extraordinario guion de William Goldman. Me duermo pensando en ella. No en El hombre del norte."
"Jun 3, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers aka Bobby Eggs is back, this time with a Viking epic featuring the talents of a Skarsgaard and Bjork. Does he bring us the blockbuster we've been advertised, or another classic Eggers indie pic? Is this this film that wins over Brian? We're talking all things NORTHMAN this week before Weekly Recommends and after a lil update on the 2022 Movie Draft."
"Jun 1, 2022",POSITIVE," The story: In this Viking saga set mainly in Iceland, Prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak as a child and Alexander Skarsgard as an adult) witnesses the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), at the hands of his uncle Fjolnir (Danish actor Claes Bang). Fjolnir also kidnaps his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Amleth grows into a warrior and a witch (musician-actress Bjork) starts him on his path of vengeance, where he meets priestess Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). His first two features, released to acclaim, were works of horror. The Witch (2015, starring Taylor-Joy in her breakthrough) and The Lighthouse (2019), with their eloquent wordiness, spawned Internet memes. The films were unabashed love letters to gnarled old things living in realms beyond time. Norse warriors of old are revered in heavy-metal music and comic books and recently have been featured in drama series. Eggers, with Icelandic novelist and co-screenwriter Sjon, consider most pop-culture depictions inaccurate. Here, in a screenplay adapted from a legend (one that supposedly inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet), Vikings are superstitious slavers and bloodlust-driven fighters. But they are also settled, relatively wealthy pastoralists and merchants with trade links with the remnants of the Roman Empire. The story stays close to realism in another way. It holds that the legends are true and in the 10th century, the beings of Norse mythology - such as the Valkyries (female spirits guiding the dead to the next world) and the Fenrir (the giant wolf god) - were real. It goes without saying that one's fate is inescapable. But if you go in expecting this to be paced like a Marvel movie, you will be disappointed. The beats are much slower and, when supernatural creatures appear, they do so like the Great Eagles in The Lord Of The Rings films (2001 to 2003). They unravel a knotty plot problem, then vanish."
"Jun 1, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers returns to the big screen for The Northman, an epic historical action drama that serves as his most ambitious, high-budget project yet. A career that began with low-budget horror films The Witch and The Lighthouse, Eggers has arrived in theaters with a good, old-fashioned revenge thriller. The emphasis here is on old-fashioned, as he masterfully transports us back to 895 A.D. for a movie about Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Viking on a mission to kill his uncle, who killed Amleth’s father and kidnapped his mother two decades prior. This is a triumphant effort from Eggers to tell a more mainstream narrative while keeping in tune with his distinct stylings. Those who have seen Eggers’s previous work know that he is partial to graphic, surreal imagery carefully constructed to be as evocative as possible. Eggers brings some of that to The Northman, giving his characters striking visions that lead to a beautifully unique cinematic experience. At the same time, he crafts a story of vengeance that serves the characters very well. Amleth’s words, “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir,” echo through the screen. At its core, the story is conventional. Amleth’s journey is what originally inspired The Tragedy of Hamlet, with the protagonists’ names serving as anagrams. Eggers tells a very Shakespearean tale, opening with a gripping prologue that introduces the audience to Amleth as a child. Oscar Novak does an incredible job in his scenes as young Amleth, and he shares the screen well with Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe, who provide excellent work with their brief screen time. As they perform a spiritual ceremony on all fours, their dedication to the craft is admirable. They behave like animals and sell a scene that could have been lost without the right performers and direction. What Eggers has mastered as a filmmaker is transporting his audience into a time entirely different from our own. Once his films begin, total immersion starts as you enter an experience unlike any other. The craftsmanship and attention to detail in every bit of The Northman are stunning, with believable, immaculate production design. While some films set in the past make the mistake of having everything feel polished and artificial, this movie is gritty, with dirty costumes in settings that complement the film’s dark tone. This is also Eggers’s first venture into large-scale action sequences. While the film’s focus isn’t the action, the movie features some of the most gripping battle sequences of the year. There are long takes with copious amounts of bloody, brutal violence that can be shocking. The barbarity of every insane fight scene matches the fierce nature of the Vikings and demonstrates the strength of Amleth as he embarks on his plan of vengeance. Skarsgård, who has shown his physical prowess in The Legend of Tarzan, outshines himself with his masterful stuntwork in this film. As far as the film’s story goes, the easiest complaint is that it uses familiar ingredients. Amleth’s goal of revenge is conventional, but it is perhaps the only accessible aspect of a movie that is uninterested in making things relatable for a 21st-century audience. The film is based on a classic legend, and Eggers does an excellent job of putting his artistic voice onto it. The second act can slow down at times, but the sublime cinematography and the performances are very engaging. Anya Taylor-Joy continues to outdo herself as an actress, and Nicole Kidman is phenomenal, as is Claes Bang as the film’s antagonist. Eggers also knew the right moments to bring his characters into dramatic directions, with a shocking revelation that pushes the protagonist into dark places. The Northman is an exceptionally crafted film with unconventional visuals and a filmmaking voice behind it that is powerfully unique. There is graphic violence and dark moments all over this film, and it is a story brought to life wonderfully by a cinematic auteur. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 7 equates to “Good.” A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films."
"May 31, 2022",POSITIVE," Blood runs, mud flies and bones crack — in crisp, percussive ways you’ve hopefully never heard in real life — throughout The Northman, a grand, gut-spilling Norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern. Plunging us into a Viking Age of elemental survival strategies and unfettered masculine brutality, Robert Eggers’ film shows off all the immersive world-building a huge Hollywood budget can buy, minus any obvious studio lacquer: everything here feels whittled from stone, woven from flesh, grown from the ground up, and then destroyed in a frenzy of bruising, exactingly choreographed warfare. By the time Björk shows up in a cameo — her first film appearance in 17 years — as a hollow-eyed mystic, you feel genuinely transported to another dimension. The Northman is a film touched by madness, that also happens to know exactly what it’s doing. With so much overwhelming sensory detail at play,  Eggers keeps the story back-of-a-postcard simple. When his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), is murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), young Prince Amleth flees and grows into the formidable form of Alexander Skarsgård, returning years later to avenge his father’s death, rescue his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman, revealing complex layers of feminine desire and pragmatism in this testosterone-driven tale) and reclaim his kingdom. If it sounds familiar, that’s no accident. Eggers is working from the medieval Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which centuries later trickled down into Shakespeare’s Hamlet; in Hollywood terms, The Northman shares DNA with The Lion King, if not a whole lot else. But as with Eggers’ previous films, the febrile period visions The Witch and The Lighthouse, it’s less about the story, and more about the go-for-broke telling, from the rich, flavourful historical idiom in which he writes — this time in collaboration with revered Icelandic poet Sjón — to the vast, visceral, carved-in-wood imagery that gives the words their weight. Meanwhile, the stripped, linear narrative is complicated by an anxious, uncertain moral conscience that you don’t find in, say, Gladiator: Amleth is unwaveringly determined to have his revenge in this life or the next, yet as much as we understand his motives, the more he slashes and slays his way toward that goal, the more we question its value. Disturbing and exhilarating at once, The Northman is troubled by toxic cycles of male violence, even as it gets us waist-deep in battle."
"May 29, 2022",POSITIVE," Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, who is determined to win back the kingdom stolen from his father, in Robert Eggers’ “The Northman.” (Photo by Aidan Monaghan, courtesy of Focus Features.) Like the muscular fighter and the seductive sorceress at its heart, Robert Eggers’ “The Northman” besieges and bewitches the viewer in equal measure with its realistically bloody and enthrallingly haunted view of life among the Vikings. It’s near the end of the 10th century C.E., and a Viking castle is awaiting the return of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and his cohort from their latest battles. The queen, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), prepares for the king’s arrival, as is their teen son, Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandil takes Amleth on a vision quest — involving a steam hut, psychedelics and the leering jester, Helmir (Willem Dafoe) — that’s the first step of the lad’s eventual ascension to his dad’s throne. But Arvandil’s brother, Fjölnir (Danish actor Claes Bang), has other ideas. He leads a group of soldiers to assassinate the king, kidnap Gudrun, and declare himself the new king. The only mistake Fjölnir makes is letting Amleth get away. The lad rows a small boat out to sea, with three vows on his lips: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Years pass, and Amleth — played as a strapping adult by Alexander Skarsgård — is still reciting those vows, but as a soldier in a mercenary army. After his group pillages a village, he rescues a Slavic maiden, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), from getting killed in the melee. When he hears Olga is being shipped off with some newly enslaved villagers to Iceland, where Fjölnir now lives, Amleth becomes a slave himself to join the voyage and finally exact his revenge. In Iceland, Amleth discovers Fjölnir has already lost Aurvandil’s kingdom, and the new settlement he leads is managed through fear by Fjölnir’s sniveling prince, Thórir (Gustav Lindh), who looks like a Dark Ages version of Jared Kushner. Amleth works cautiously at first, scoping out Fjölnir’s new kingdom before taking it down. Amleth also teams with Olga, who is as ruthless as he is. “Your strength breaks men’s bones,” Olga tells Amleth, adding, “I have the cunning to break their minds.” Eggers — as he did in his first two films, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — creates a world where harsh reality and mysticism live side by side. In long, fluid takes, Eggers captures the unrelenting violence of marauders ransacking villages and slaughtering the locals. But the script, which Eggers wrote with the Icelandic writer Sjón (“Lamb”), also leaves room for psychedelic spirit journeys, visits with vision-seeing priestesses (one of them played by Björk), and the influence of dreams on Amleth’s gory reality. Taylor-Joy, following her run that included “The Queen’s Gambit” and “Last Night in Soho,” continues to be one of the most fascinating young stars to watch. Kidman makes the most out of her one surprising moment, and Bang (“The Square,” “The Burnt Orange Heresy”) brings a weary menace to the traitorous Fjölnir. But “The Northman” forces all eyes toward Skarsgård, who presents Amleth as a brawny, brooding hero who must learn that the childhood ideas of vengeance must inevitably yield to the adult reality that many things are not what they appear to be.  Fans of “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” low-budget movies that orchestrated an atmosphere of dread, were going to be curious what Eggers could do on a larger scale. What he’s created is an authentic-looking and dream-filled world of a thousand years ago, sometimes beautiful and often brutal — but always fascinating."
"May 28, 2022",POSITIVE," A savage and mesmerizing Viking saga like no other, Robert Eggers’ The Northman leaves your senses bludgeoned by the time the credits roll. Like The Witch and The Lighthouse, which made Eggers an indie horror darling, his latest has an obsessive intrigue with pastoral history, baroque language, and pagan mythology, albeit on a much larger scale. With a budget of nearly 90 million dollars, this visually striking odyssey is distinguished by its heavily researched set pieces, authentic costuming, dreamlike vistas, and visceral, bone-cracking battle sequences. It’s the 9th century in Scandinavia as we’re introduced to Prince Amleth, the son of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). When the battle-weary ruler returns to his dilapidated kingdom and beautiful wife, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), after years of fighting wars and scouring the countryside, he takes young Amleth to a sage (Willem Defoe) for an initiation ceremony where they ingest psychedelics, howl like dogs, and experience visions of their family tree. This is pure Robert Eggers’ territory – a dark realm where uncertainty, paranoia and magic coexist. The spell quickly ends however, when the child witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murder his father. As the boy escapes into the wilderness, he vows to avenge his father and save his mother from his uncle’s tyranny. Several years later, a bearded and sinewy Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) travels the Scandinavian countryside with other grunting, homicidal Vikings. These musclebound marauders invade small villages and decimate entire families before feasting on their food and wine. One night, after a particularly brutal skirmish, Amleth encounters a bejeweled Seeress (Bjork) who informs him that his uncle fled to Iceland with his mother who he recently took as his bride. With his thirst for revenge rekindled, Amleth jumps on a ship and insinuates himself with a group of slaves bound for Iceland, including the alluring Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). From here, the movie ratchets up the tension as Amleth aims to exact his revenge on his uncle. If the story sounds familiar (a young man avenging his father’s murder by the uncle who married his mother), you probably heard of a play called Hamlet. Inspired by the same Scandinavian folktale, you can discern the contours of that play in the film’s narrative. Eggers simply exhumed its bones and slapped some muscle on it. Instead of a brooding Danish prince who wails, “To be or not to be,” our hero is a twisted ball of hate and cunning. He’s not apprehensive about killing his uncle as much as enjoying the process of tormenting him. It’s Shakespeare on psychedelics and Swedish Death Metal. If The Northman shares anything with other Hamlet adaptations, it’s the spiritual exploration of moral uncertainty, which questions the glory in killing another man, even if it’s justified. Co-written by Eggers and Sjon (Lamb), the film is not without a misstep or two. In constructing a world where loathing, lust and violence are a way of life, the filmmakers forgo levity and human empathy. Although we understand Amleth philosophically, we don’t feel an emotional connection to him or anyone else. A little nuance and humor would’ve gone a long way, especially since Eggers’ somber tone and often incoherent antediluvian dialogue already keeps us at a distance. But these are modest gripes for a work that achieves greatness on such an impressive canvas. Every frame of Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography is a carefully rendered baroque painting, while the score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough pushes us deeper into the ether with transcendent rhythms and primordial drums. Taking cues from films like Excalibur and Conan the Barbarian, Eggers is able to weave hypnotic hallucinatory sequences into the film’s embroidery without losing sight of the central plot. It also never hurts to have a remarkable cast. Skarsgard inhabits Amleth with such ferocity, you wonder if he had a mental breakdown on set. Bang’s murderous uncle balances repressed rage and existential confusion with an amazing fluidity, while Kidman’s Queen Gudrun absolutely slays. She’s frightening. And the always mesmerizing Taylor Joy adds a bit of romance and grace to a movie brimming with machismo. The real star however is the movie’s ethereal and paranoid atmosphere, which Eggers crafts with a sculptor’s precision. He’s proven himself to be a genuine filmmaker. Unlike a lot of contemporary directors who edit their movies like overly eager children on a sugar high, Eggers brings a sense of patience and curiosity. With a Kurosawa-esqe flair, he uses long tracking shots and detailed production designs to pull you into the dark landscape, while maintaining an undercurrent of menace. Even if some of the thinly drawn characters get buried under a mountain of mud, bone, and gristle, The Northman is a compelling experience. It’s also one of the most brutal and astonishing films of the year."
"May 28, 2022",POSITIVE,A complete cinematic experience from the sound&#44; score&#44; acting&#44; aesthetic&#44; story&#44; and directing is masterfully put together and executed&#46;  
"May 27, 2022",POSITIVE," Imagine being Robert Eggers right now. Stunning audiences in 2105 with the captivating The Witch (and also introducing them to the incredible Anya Taylor-Joy), following up in 2019 with the near-indescribable The Lighthouse – we’re now here with an epic for the ages. A feast for the senses, Norse mythology has never looked this good on the big screen nor felt as vitally visceral. What follows is a cinematic marvel. Continuing his partnership with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, the signature visual style with Eggers is present, correct and as brutally beautiful as we would expect. Each shot is a feast for the eyes – there’s something hauntingly captivating about every single frame. And there’s much to be haunted by here. This is a film that is as vicious and violent as you would hope for from a tale with these origins. It’s to point of near-ecstatic deliciousness that we bare witness to such primal and pulsating savagery. The reason it is so compelling is the substance that comes with the ascetic. Skarsgård in particular is a tour-de-force, a hulking embodiment of unbridled obsession with fate & destiny. It feels wrong to describe his undeterred quest for retribution as a pleasure to watch yet, thanks to Eggers at the helm it genuinely is. Within the barbarity, there’s wonderful teasing out on the threads than bind and drive us – how humans are dammed to follow a path that is not of their own choosing. "

"May 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Con solo dos películas en su haber: La bruja (2015), una de las cumbres del terror contemporáneo, y El faro (2019), una pesadilla expresionista que mezclaba en un salto sin red terror y comedia bruta, el cineasta norteamericano Robert Eggers da el salto a las grandes superproducciones (90 millones de dólares) de la mano de Universal y Focus Features con El hombre del norte, una película de vikingos -¡gran subgénero que nos ha dado películas de la talla de Los vikingos (1958) de Richard Fleischer o La furia de los vikingos (1961) de Mario Bava!-, que cruza el folk horror más lisérgico -hay mucha brujería e iconografía pagana absolutamente deliciosa- con la violencia más salvaje y gore que uno se pueda llevar a la cara (algo realmente poco habitual en los blockbusters norteamericanos). El cineasta la ha definido como un cruce entre Andrei Rublev (1966) de Andrei Tarkovsky y Conan el bárbaro (1982) de John Milius, una definición tan atrevida como acertada, a la que habría que añadir algo del nihilismo bruto de una de las joyas del género como es Valhalla Rising (2009) de Nicolas Winding Refn. El hombre del norte es una historia de venganza clásica ancestral de la literatura nórdica. Tanto es así que dicen que inspiró a Shakespeare para su Hamlet (1603), de ahí que el protagonista, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), sólo cambie una hache de sitio en su nombre. La raíz shakesperiana, en la línea de Trono de sangre (1957) de Akira Kurosawa, donde también se mezclaba las traiciones familiares y los asesinatos descarnados con el horror brujeril, es clara en la película de Eggers, donde el protagonista buscará saborear la sangre de su tío Fjölnir (un buen Claes Bang), responsable del asesinato de su padre (Ethan Hawke) y nuevo marido de su madre (Nicole Kidman, pocas veces tan aterradora como en esta película).  El hombre del norte  llega a las pantallas no sin polémica, tras las quejas del realizador por la injerencia de la major a la hora de realizar cambios sobre el corte final, al parecer, tras no haber funcionado del todo bien los “test screenings” realizados. Posición que el mismo Eggers ha debido aclarar esta misma semana diciendo que dichos cambios, al final, han mejorado la película al hacerla más accesible. Como no tengo ni la más remota idea de qué significa toda esa cháchara, vamos a hacer oídos sordos a la algo desastrosa campaña de marketing de la película (posters promocionales inclusive) y centrarnos en el resultado final que sí hemos podido ver. Y, visto lo visto, creo que El hombre del norte, incluso aún más que Dune (2021), es uno de los blockbuster de autor más brutales, a contracorriente y suicida que se hayan podido ver en pantalla grande. Eggers cambia de escala pero lo hace sin dejarse nada por el camino de aquello que convierte su cine en tan excitante y aterrador.  Jugando entre la abstracción, como digo, con una contundente iconografía terrorífica vikinga -la labor de documentación histórica y artística ha debido ser tremendamente exhaustiva-, y la fisicidad más visceral y gutural que uno pueda llevarse a la cara -es incontable el número de desmembraciones vistas en la película-, Eggers buscar que su Hamlet tenga fuertes raíces dramáticas -qué bien le sienta a la película el contrapeso romántico con el personaje de Anya Taylor-Joy- que luego no duda en solucionar con sólida densidad emocional y un placer por el gore analógico que hace que todas las películas de super-héroes por comparación parezcan Peppa Pig.  La película, claro, no deja de ser algo realmente extraño, pero extraño en la línea de la sublime El caballero verde (2021) de David Lowery: una puesta en escena magnífica, entre lo alambicado y lo brutalmente directo, en una narración que avanza sin miedo hacia el fatalismo existencial. Ojalá la taquilla responda a tan arriesgada propuesta."

"May 20, 2022",POSITIVE," 
Robert Eggers, one of the most vital contemporary American film-makers thanks to his uniquely captivating movies The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), scales things up considerably for this historical epic about a Viking prince's
quest for vengeance.
 Sometime around the 10th century, a Scandinavian king (Ethan Hawke) returns home from war to his queen (Nicole Kidman) and adolescent son Amleth (Oscar Novak). After partaking in a ritualistic rite of passage with his father, Amleth witnesses the king's brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), murder his father. Thought dead, Amleth escapes, vowing revenge, and grows up to be a hulk of a man played by Alexander Skarsgard, now with considerable abilities as a killer honed by years of being a Viking berserker. After an especially bloody raid (which includes a bravura single-shot sequence in which Skarsgard pummels multiple poor souls), Amleth encounters a Seeress (played by Icelandic singer Bjork), who informs him that his opportunity for revenge will soon present itself. Sure enough, Amleth is able to get himself sold as a slave into his now-deposed uncle's ownership, where he plots to kill Fjolnir and rescue his mother, who is now Fjolnir's wife. Apparently spurred on by Swedish star Skarsgard's desire to make a Viking movie, Eggers teamed up with Icelandic novelist/poet Sjon to write the screenplay based on the myth that also inspired Hamlet. Both of Eggers' previous films demonstrate a proclivity for intense visions of the past informed by dream-like imagery and a grimy, muddy aesthetic. As you might imagine, those skills are very well-suited to a bloody Viking epic, and there is a wide variety of aesthetic wonders to behold here. In a post Game of Thrones world, it's a challenge to make anything medieval seem especially brutal or bold, but Eggers easily clears that bar, evoking a primal, mythic quality that widens the eyes. But although there is not a single dull moment in this big-budget fever dream, there is a minor sense that something has been lost, emotionally speaking, with Eggers working on such a large canvas. He may be slightly better suited to more intimate storytelling. That said, it feels like a miracle that this film exists, and it's worth celebrating for the pure artistic ambition of it all. Big swings like this are always a good thing. Skarsgard looks the part but can never quite shake a slight contemporary quality. The Witch breakout Anya Taylor-Joy is great as a fellow slave, and The Lighthouse star Willem Dafoe is a hoot in a brief role as a jester/soothsayer. Danish actor Bang is fantastic as well, but in the acting stakes, Kidman (who played Skarsgard's wife in Big Little Lies) is the real star player here, once again displaying her ability to draw upon unparalleled levels of intensity in her performing.

"May 19, 2022",NEUTRAL," El hombre del Norte (The Northman, Estados Unidos/2022). Dirección: Robert Eggers. Guion: Sjón y Robert Eggers. Fotografía: Jarin Blaschke. Música: Robin Carolan y Sebastian Gainsborough. Edición: Louise Ford. Elenco: Alexander Skargard, Claes Bang, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, Willem Dafoe. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 136 minutos. Calificación: solo apta para mayores de 16 años. Nuestra opinión: buena. La nueva película de Robert Eggers era una de las más esperadas del año. Se había creado una corriente de genuina y generalizada curiosidad por saber cómo se manejaría el talentoso creador de La bruja y El faro por primera vez con muchísimos recursos a su disposición: una producción de elevada escala, una historia mucho más ambiciosa y un vasto elenco de estrellas. La elección de una historia tan intensa, brutal, impetuosa y feroz como la que se narra en El hombre del Norte completa el cuadro. Ya sabemos que Eggers no se impone límites ni reservas cuando se decide a explorar los vínculos entre lo real y lo fantástico en escenarios en los que prevalecen los rituales arcanos, los temores religiosos y las conductas primitivas. Por eso, no hay palabra mejor que “visceral”, en su más amplio significado, como síntesis compacta de todo lo que ocurre aquí. Abunda aquí la exposición de cuerpos abiertos y desgarrados en unas cuantas batallas muy cruentas y también el carácter simbólico del término: los personajes se dejan llevar todo el tiempo por comportamientos desbordados y hasta inmanejables desde lo emocional. Sobre todo cuando perciben que es imposible torcer el destino que se les asigna. Por eso, aunque la acción transcurra durante el siglo X de nuestra era en algún lugar de los dominios vikingos, el escenario real es el de una verdadera tragedia clásica no demasiado difícil de comprender. Un rey guerrero regresa al hogar tras una larga campaña con la certeza de que será traicionado y, a la vez, deberá apresurarse para pasar el legado de su corona a un hijo todavía adolescente. El heredero, testigo mudo del instante en que la traición se ejecuta con crueldad en el propio seno familiar, debe escaparse para no quedar arrastrado por ella. Muchos años después regresará para cumplir con su venganza, aunque el plan se torna cada vez más arduo con la aparición de detalles inesperados. Como en sus películas anteriores, Eggers parte de la certeza histórica para tomar impulso y moverse una vez más a partir de ellas en las difusas fronteras que separan a la realidad del mito. Se apoya en cuidadas referencias visuales y arqueológicas para mostrar cómo se vivía en ese hostil rincón del mundo azotado todo el tiempo por la crudeza del clima y la ferocidad de sus habitantes. Estamos en medio de un universo sellado a fuego por un espiral de violencia que parece retroalimentarse todo el tiempo y no terminar nunca. Quienes hayan visto El faro y La bruja encontrarán aquí marcas parecidas: ritos tribales y brujerías, conductas primitivas, constantes pulsiones sexuales (que hasta incluyen el fantasma del incesto), ceremonias de iniciación y de camaradería, tendencia al exceso. Lo que no se aprecia del todo en El hombre del Norte es aquello que rápidamente convirtió a Eggers en un creador provocativo, original, capaz de crear una fusión nueva y distinta entre varios géneros: el terror, el cine fantástico, el drama histórico. Con la notable ayuda de sus colaboradores habituales (el director de fotografía Jarin Blaschke, la vestuarista Louise Ford, los directores de arte Craig Lathrop y Robert Cowper) y un rodaje en espléndidos escenarios naturales de Islandia, Eggers logra sostener esa atmósfera a través de una sucesión de planos y secuencias de inquietante, magnética y poderosa belleza. Pero detrás de ellas hay aquí menos misterio y sorpresa que en sus obras anteriores. Por más que se asocien, por ejemplo, ciertas conductas humanas a comportamientos propios del reino animal (cuervos, osos, lobos), El hombre del Norte nos cuenta una historia de venganza no demasiado diferente a otras que hemos visto antes. Mucho más sangrienta, eso sí. En un elenco exigido por un gran compromiso físico y anímico, Alexander Skargard y Claes Bang aportan presencia y entrega absoluta. Anya Taylor-Joy se luce en un breve y enigmático personaje de gélida belleza y acento eslavo. Nicole Kidman viste de elocuente teatralidad su inquietante papel, y Björk, Ethan Hawke y Willem Dafoe apenas tienen tiempo para mostrarse. En cuanto a Eggers, queda claro que a ahora dispone de muchos más recursos para contar historias a su manera, pero todavía no termina de acomodarse a esta nueva realidad. Dijo, por ejemplo, que le hubiese gustado que toda la película se hablara en el nórdico antiguo que escuchamos aquí solo en los momentos ceremoniales. Para el resto debió resignarse al inglés que se utiliza cada vez que un cine con pretensiones quiere instalarse en tiempos antiguos o medievales. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"May 18, 2022",POSITIVE," Vikings in pop culture have gotten a bit too cozy as of late. Instead of depicting them as the bloodthirsty, pirating, raping warriors that they were, conquering every new land and leaving a bloody trail behind them, we’ve gotten a defanged version of the terrifying conquerors. While recent shows like Vikings and Vikings: Valhalla show a version of Vikings with a heart of gold (and not a slave in sight) and games like Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla romanticize the wandering journey and noble soul of a Viking, Robert Eggers’ The Northman does neither. I’m not saying the game and those shows don’t have their own merit, but The Northman is not trying to curry your favor for its berserker protagonist.  Based on the legend of Amleth which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet (something you quickly notice once you watch the movie) the only thing familiar about the world of The Northman is its plot. Indeed, from hauntings to Yorick’s skull, the film doesn’t deviate too much from the soul of the story we’ve gotten to know so well. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is a Viking prince on the run after witnessing the murder of his father Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) by the hand of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). He escapes as a child, vowing to return for vengeance and to save his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman).  Years on his own, plagued and infected by hate and vengeance have turned Amleth into nothing short of a beast. It isn’t until, during one of his blood-soaked raids, where he meets a Seeress (Björk) that he is righted once more. Sailing to Iceland disguised as a slave alongside a Slavic witch named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth schemes and seethes. Unlike Eggers’ previous features, there’s very little that is surprising or unexpected when it comes to The Northman. Those who label it as horror are fundamentally misunderstanding what horror is. This is a revenge story, closer in relation to The Count of Monte Cristo than The Witch or The Lighthouse.  Instead, Eggers proves that the connecting thread in his films is a distinct and enchanting blend of the bizarre and arcane with dashes of folkloric magic and indulgence in fantasy. Instead of dabbling in magical realism and making us question what is real and what is superstition, it is all real for these characters. Just as Thomasin can live deliciously, so too can Amleth become beast-like and wield magical blades.  It’s inspiring to see that stories like this can still exist. Ones that aren’t afraid to push the boundaries between genres, because while dubbing The Northman as a historical epic isn’t necessarily wrong, it would be inaccurate. Along with its violence and costuming and dead languages, there is also a surprising amount of humor, romance, and fantasy. From burping and farting to pretending to be literal wolves, the scenes that brought me surprising mirth were funny because of their unflinching intensity. The situation, as a viewer from 2022, is entirely comical, but for the characters, it’s real. That’s not to say that you aren’t meant to laugh at some of those scenes, they’re meant to be ridiculous.  On the same note, the scenes between Amleth and Taylor-Joy’s Olga are surprisingly tender. Wrapped within this story of Hamlet could have been a burgeoning story of a young Lord and Lady Macbeth. Olga is equal parts ethereal and vicious, far from a shrinking violet, her alliance and connection to Amleth ground his character in something real. She’s not there to be beautiful Ophelia and die, she is his partner, his savior, and his purpose when he becomes rudderless. It’s touching, to see the man who was once nothing but muscle and loud screaming and grunting noises turn into open himself up to a Slavic witch and speak of the future. Eggers blends these genres and tones together effortlessly, in a way that seems so simple but is difficult to accomplish. In The Northman, Robert Eggers sheds the title of a horror director. He shows just how far his range can lead him, and it is exciting to see him lean into that. Fueling his stories with healthy doses of fantasy only serves to prove this point and adds an extra layer of excitement when I think of what fantastical story he’ll conquer next."
"May 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"  Robert Eggers has carved a niche for himself making visually arresting, thoroughly researched historical films with supernatural and folkloric overtones. It’s hyper specific and gave us two of the best movies of their kind of the past decade, The Witch from 2015 and  The Lighthouse from 2019. Both movies are deeply unsettling affairs exploring several universal themes in the weirdest ways possible. His newest movie, The Northman, is by far his least weird. That, consequently, also makes it my least favorite. It’s not a bad movie in the least, it just feels like a lot of the Eggers special sauce got watered down, even if the brutality went way, way up. The Northman‘s attention to period detail is perhaps the most impressive of Eggers’ whole career. The scope of something like this is massive, utilizing the vast, frigid landscape of Iceland to explore several different cultures melded through pillaging and slavery. Norse, Celtic, Rus, and Pict characters all occupy the screen at the same time and they each feel different in their own particular way. I never once doubted the veracity of any element on screen. It truly feels like a journey through history. What doesn’t quite have the same feeling of immersion is the story. A young Norse prince named Amleth witnesses his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke),  murdered at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), is therefore taken as Fjölnir’s new queen. Though Amleth is himself sought for death, he escapes in a boat, vowing to return one day to avenge his father, rescue his mother, and kill his uncle. Years later, Amleth is a Bear-Wolf Viking raider, now in the ab-having portrayal of Alexander Skarsgård, the beefiest Skarsgård. After ransacking a Russian village, Amleth overhears a tale of King Fjölnir’s loss of his kingdom. He is little more than a town chieftain in Iceland, but Amleth’s hatred and fire for vengeance has not died. Amleth disguises himself as a slave, and joins a caravan heading to Fjölnir’s town. Along with a cunning young Rus maiden named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth plots the slow destruction of his uncle and everything he holds dear. But, as is always the question, will revenge truly sate his bloodlust? This is one of the oldest stories in the world. I don’t mean just because this movie takes place in the late-9th century AD; you have seen this story before. It’s Conan the Barbarian, it’s Hamlet, it’s at least 50% of all spaghetti westerns. The revenge story cannot exist without effectively turning the avenger into a beast who has to choose whether to succumb to their hatred or go down a more forgiving path. The body count goes way up while they decide, naturally. Certainly it’s not like The Northman is wholly without the trademark Eggers touches. The moments when the movie truly shines are when the narrative brings in elements of folklore and superstition. When Amleth begins his nighttime raids of his uncle’s farm, we get a bit of the Norse magic and mysticism. Fjölnir’s elder son Thórir (Gustav Lindt) believes it to be the heretical magic of the Christian slaves they’d acquired from Ireland. Olga uses “Earth magic” she picked up in Rus. We see Norse ritual sacrifices to the god Freyja. It’s a fascinating mélange of different influences. While the movie definitely has its fair share of cool elements like that—Björk as an eyeless seer is a standout, and Willem Dafoe as a weird jester-meets-mystic is another—it all too frequently feels like they are at the mercy of the narrative, which is as rote and pedestrian as it gets. I love a good revenge story, don’t get me wrong, but The Northman feels trapped by it rather than using it to explore any other greater themes. Both The Witch and The Lighthouse explore some fascinating avenues of toxic masculinity. They show us men who are in various ways impotent and unable to enact the change in their own lives. Which, of course, leaves them open to the otherworldly forces which inhabit the forest or the sea that surround them. Here, the toxic masculinity feels both horribly destructive and unchecked. Adult Amleth is a ball of rage from his first appearance to his last, literally roaring or howling like the animals he emulates. His actions therefore lead other men—notably, but not limited to, Fjölnir—to reply in kind. This does feel like the men here are in their own ways impotent, but we never see an opposite. Brutality begets brutality and, justified or not, brutality is all there shall be. The cast is excellent, the cinematography from Eggers’ regular collaborator Jarin Blaschke is gorgeous, and everything about the time period feels perfect and rich. And yet, I can’t help thinking about how much more David Lowery seemed to do with his Arthurian riff, The Green Knight, last year. It too is a hero’s journey of sorts, about a man with an unsure future attempting to follow or upend his fate. But it’s so much stranger, so much more interesting in a number of different ways, and seems to use its mystical and mythological elements to a greater level of effect. The Northman is a gorgeous, textured depiction of its place and time, with so much to recommend it on both sides of the camera. I just wish it had found something deeper to show us, a more nuanced story to tell than what we get. And it’s not like there aren’t plenty of opportunities. A couple of moments in the story had me saying “Oh wow, that’s interesting!” But they ultimately only broke the rhythm of the typical genre conventions briefly. The flow of the revenge movie could not be contained for long. If you have any interest in seeing a visual interpretation of a Viking epic at its pinnacle, I would recommend seeing The Northman wherever has the best sound and projection near you. It’s a beautiful looking movie. However, don’t go in expecting the unpredictability of The Witch or The Lighthouse, to which The Northman simply can’t hold a candle, or torch."
"May 17, 2022",POSITIVE," Con tan solo tres películas Robert Eggers se ha convertido en uno de los directores más atípicos y personales del cine contemporáneo. Su forma de crear atmósferas, sus conexiones con el folk horror, su estilización visual y la manera en la que a través de sus personajes nos conectamos con lo más oscuro del alma humana lo convierten en un creador de lo más atípico, enigmático, radical a la hora de llevar siempre un poco más allá su propia cosmogonía. En ese sentido, 'El hombre del norte' es su película más ambiciosa, no solo en cuanto a presupuesto, sino también a la hora de maximizar la experiencia telúrica y sensorial por encima del relato.  Eggers se adentra en el universo vikingo abrazando toda su mitología mística y la contrapone a la brutalidad intrínseca de los guerreros berseker. Este cruce se plasma en la pantalla a través de un trabajo tan físico y visceral como alucinógeno. Por eso, buena parte de sus escenas, planificadas casi al borde del delirio a través de largas tomas de una complejidad titánica, parecen enfocadas a sumergir al espectador en una experiencia estética hipnótica en la que la épica se da la mano con la locura expresiva. Es sucia, brutal, sanguinolenta, pero al mismo tiempo, de ella emana de una belleza sobrenatural.  'El hombre del norte' es una pesadilla shakesperiana en torno a la obsesión en la que campa a sus anchas la rabia, pero también la poesía, que está llena de ideas imaginativas, que tiene una grandilocuencia pictórica inabarcable e imágenes poderosas para el recuerdo.

"May 16, 2022",POSITIVE," Just seven years ago, a little-known filmmaker named Robert Eggers debuted his brilliant feature-length debut, The Witch—an extraordinary exploration of 17th-century religious hysteria, familial dysfunction, and folk horror. The unqualified critical praise that followed its Sundance premiere was more than justified. Four years later, Eggers returned with The Lighthouse, an equally brilliant 19th-century dissection of isolation, madness, and mermaids. His second effort all but confirmed his status as a world-class talent working in or out of the art-horror sub-genre. Only Eggers’s contemporary—writer-director Ari Aster— deserves to be discussed in similar terms of talent or output. Eggers conveyed his singular obsession with period authenticity into every meticulously hand-crafted frame, in every intentional camera move, and in every heavily researched line of mythopoetic dialogue. Adapted by Eggers with Icelandic poet-novelist Sjón (Lamb) from the same source material William Shakespeare used for the slightly better-known Hamlet, this third feature-length film, The Northman, centres on Amleth (Oscar Novak), a prince and heir to a minor kingdom ruled by Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and his queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth’s idyllic existence is highlighted by a peculiarly unique father-son bonding session involving a shaman-fool (Willem Dafoe), hallucinogens, and literal animalistic howling, which ends abruptly at the sharpened edge of Aurvandil’s half-brother’s (Claes Bang) weapon. Fjölnir takes Aurvandil’s kingdom, makes Gudrún his wife, and orders Amleth’s execution. Amleth escapes certain death but only after promising to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. It’s far easier vowed than done and a multi-decade interlude begins, where Amleth, now an outcast without title or property, grows up into a mega-brooding, hulking berserker (Alexander Skarsgård). Between the foundational trauma of losing everything at an early, impressionable age and the unbreakable vow he made then, Amleth’s future seems to involve Viking-era pillaging, plundering, and dying in combat (hello, Valhalla). That’s before, though, an unnamed seeress played by Björk in a remarkably memorable cameo, reminds Amleth of an immutable fate defined by the vow he made decades earlier. Where Shakespeare’s conscience-stricken Hamlet fatally hesitates in taking revenge against his brother-killing uncle and duplicitous mother, sealing his own fate, Eggers and Sjón leverage the idea of hesitation into a conflict between fate. Alongside that existential struggle comes Amleth’s long-buried desire for domesticity in the form of Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Olga is a Russian woman taken as a result of The Northman’s first extended set-piece, an elaborately choreographed, four-minute single take that pits Amleth and his fellow berserkers against a lightly defended Russian village. (Spoiler: The Russian village doesn’t stand a chance.) As bravura as anything in Eggers’s short, remarkable career, that first set-piece will linger in the audience’s minds as both mesmerizing and horrific. The filmmaker deliberately challenges the audience to continue their presumptive identification with Amleth and his quest. It’s a risk Eggers obviously considered and accepted when making The Northman, though it’s certainly likely to make some moviegoers or viewers hit the pause button and either bail or become apathetic toward Amleth’s blood- and gore-filled quest. They’ll still be pulled in by Eggers’ obsessive attention to period detail and visual style, but may keep Amleth and the characters in The Northman at arm’s length, their individual and collective fates more like pawns or minor pieces swept off a chessboard by a temperamental toddler. For those who aren’t alienated by the outcome of that first, brutal set-piece, Eggers’ exploration of Amleth’s monomaniacal journey suggests an inherent, if not necessarily original, critique of revenge narratives (i.e., who becomes the point of identification and why). And for Amleth, whose life has been defined by an intractable, inescapable vow (fate less as a mystical or supernatural form than a social, cultural, and political one), that journey comes full circle back to the foundational, life-altering experience watching his uncle commit regicide. It’s a toxic, ultimately destructive form of masculinity that leads in only one direction at the metaphorical, if not literal, gates of hell. Even as Olga, a pagan witch of sorts, offers another option (i.e., domesticity), Amleth can only see the vow he must fulfill and the fate he must embrace. That Amleth can’t bring himself to see any alternatives becomes, like Hamlet’s well-documented hesitation, his fatal flaw. While it’s impossible to separate his narrative from his visual style, Eggers continues his seemingly meteoric ascent to world-class filmmaker status, expanding his toolkit to encompass a breathtakingly intense, attention-grabbing, single-take approach to scene and story creation unlike anything else. It’s an approach that can be expensive (a reported $90M budget for a superhero- and spandex-free film) and demands next-level commitment from his collaborators on either side of the camera, including cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, editor Louise Ford, production designer Craig Lathrop, and costume designer Linda Muir, all of whom worked on Eggers first and second feature-length films.

"May 16, 2022",POSITIVE," Raise your alehorn and sword for mighty Robert Eggers, a true visionary, for he is the helmsman of The Northman (now on Prime Video), The Lighthouse and The Witch (or The VVitch if you please), a most awesomely unholy celluloid triumvirate. His latest is a Viking revenge saga promising enough barbarity and attention to authentic period minutiae to render one slackjaw with awe. Alexander Skarsgard and his pitiless trapezius muscles take center screen as a berserker questing to slake his thirst for vengeance, and his journey brings him in contact with fellow medieval nutjobs played by Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe and, lured back into film by forces surely beyond our comprehension, the sovereign goddess Bjork. I’m under the impression that if one doesn’t watch The Northman one risks being slaughtered for one’s great weakness, so here goes.  The Gist: The Northman opens as every movie should, with a direful prayer to a volcano. It’s A.D. 895, a time apparently void of rational thought. Odin has brought King Aurvandill War-Raven (Hawke) home from battle to his wife Queen Gudrun (Kidman) and tween son Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandill hugs the living shit out of his boy; it’s a man’s man’s man’s man’s man’s world. His subjects pose in firelight as if they exist in ancient paintings. He eyes his plunder. Chained female slaves parade solemnly nearby. Gudrun suggests they head to the bedchamber, but there’s no time for that – Aurvandill sports a torso gash that nearly rendered him paté for vultures. It’s time to initiate his successor to the Tree of Kings, which requires him to bring Amleth to Heimir the Fool and Also the Mystical Dealer of Scandinavian Psychedelics, who will have them bark and howl and run about on all fours like wolves and lap up the drugs and belch and fart and levitate in front of surreal visions and take a pledge of vengeance when fathers are killed in glory in battle and now Amleth is a man. Amleth has barely coming-of-age’d when Aurvandill is betray’d by his own brother. The boy watches as Fjolnir (Claes Bang) commits regicide and sends his men to commit nepoticide, but when Amleth escapes, he vows to commit avunculicide because one doesn’t take a stoned lupine-oath without being fully dedicated to it. YEARS LATER. Amleth is now played by Skarsgard and has oarboated his traps unto godliness. All the better to help one achieve fireside reverie in praise of battle, and then run fearlessly into such, putting an ax into lesser men until their blood runs down one’s chiseled f—ing delts, lats and abs – and one red droplet down his cheek like a tear. It’s a living. He visits the Temple of Bjork and she reminds him of his oath, and then a RAVEN alights and LOOKS him in THE EYE. He quits the Viking gig and cuts off his hair and brands himself like a slave and passes himself as such on a boat headed to Fjolnir’s sheep farm in Iceland. Fjolnir is no longer king but that doesn’t mean he deserves to still have his head attached to his body. That’s just logic. Over stormy seas the slavers doth sail, and Amleth meets fellow prisoner Olga of the Birch Forest (Taylor-Joy), who utters spells in foreign tongues. He shares his story and they do what everyone does on first dates in romantic comedies, they vow to help each other kill people. He can break men’s bones, she says, “but I have the cunning to break their minds.” This is love if I’ve ever seen it. They’re assimilated into Fjolnir’s enslavement ranks. Amleth looks up and sees his mother shooing ravens from her window. She is now Fjolnir’s wife and they have a young son and he has another son from a previous relationship who’s a sad, sorry weakling. Fate tugs at Amleth: He follows the fox to get to the He-witch, he consults the He-witch to get the rope, he uses the rope to get to the zombie, he vanquishes the zombie to get the sword and he’ll use the sword to get his revenge, which wiggled and jiggled and tickled inside him – but to what end? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: The Northman is sort of Mel Gibson’s The Green Knight. It recalls Apocalypto, The Passion of the Christ and Braveheart in its gruesome old-world bloodletting, and shares kinship with the likes of Gladiator and 300. Performance Worth Watching: Kidman acts up a storm in a key scene that cracks this plot wide open, and proves that sanity is a seed that finds no purchase in this world. Memorable Dialogue: I’m pretty sure Amleth’s mantra, “I will avenge you Father, I will save you Mother, I will kill you Fjolnir” is the “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die” for a new generation. I also feel Fjolnir’s pain when he declares, “This is not the work of my god. This is truly sorcery!” because I say the exact same thing when the Detroit Lions lose. Sex and Skin: Vaguely shadowy frontal nudeness by fire- and lava-light; exposed hindquarters when Amleth and Olga make love on the forest floor within a shaft of moonlight, surely dirty-talking about slaying thine enemies and such. Our Take: The Northman is lunacy delivered with dead sincerity, and you’ll either roll your eyes and be repulsed, or leap headlong into the flaming crazy and revel in it. The latter reaction is far more tempting for those of us familiar with Eggers’ immersive, unapologetically weird, unsettling visual style, rife with long, virtuoso shots; his occultic-spiritual nightmare stories; and his insistence upon authenticity, which borders on obsessive and dares us to find an anachronism. This Viking tale – co-written by Eggers and Icelandic poet-artist Sjon, and derived from the Saxo Grammaticus-penned legend that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet – is one damn thing after another, rotating among scenes of grotesque violence, whispered declarations and pagan rituals ranging from randy courtship dances to human sacrifice, because in this culture, putting people into this world is just as maniacally fun as taking them out of it. So what we have here is a revenge picture enriched by eye-widening things: surreal iconography, liturgical deliria, soothsayer Bjork, an old desiccated severed head whose incredibly distinctive bone structure is clearly that of Willem Dafoe – things we haven’t seen before. And that experience is such a rarity, something to be treasured. Eggers looks upon the not-tortured-enough morality of this strange world with an unjudging eye; it’s a kill-or-be-enslaved existence ruled by the most putridly toxic masculinity, the type that inspires a man to utter I WILL BECOME A HAILSTORM OF IRON AND STEEL as he plots to torture those who committed the gravest of betrayals against him. Discomfort may very well be Eggers’ intent, whether it’s the perverted joy we don’t want to admit we feel when Amleth, schooled in the cruel domination of those weaker than him, inflicts violence upon his foes; or the whiplash guilt we experience when we realize how not fun it would be to watch a movie about a Viking learning to turn the other cheek. This is, after all, not a Christian society – “Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree!” declares a Viking man known as Finnr The Nose-Stub, because his proboscis was sliced off and left for the squirrels. The Northman is perhaps a statement on the folly of revenge and, for that matter, that of fate itself, since the people of ca. 1000 A.D. likely could not fathom the concept of free will. Eggers’ more pointed goal may be simply to adhere unyieldingly and unapologetically to that worldview, so deranged, strange and fascinating to our modern eyes. Our Call: STREAM IT. The Northman marries the battle epic with the chimerical vision of a director who’s one of the best in today’s game. It’s weird and it’s wondrous."
"May 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Fans of director Robert Eggers will not be disappointed in his latest film “The Northman,” an epic Viking revenge saga that stays true to his vision and style. This extremely violent, bloody, and gory film is gorgeously crafted, the performances are masterful, and the care taken to make it as historically accurate as possible is something to be commended. Twenty years later, an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has become a warrior Viking, tearing through villages on a fighting and murdering rampage. When he learns where his mother and uncle are living, the man disguises himself as a slave and goes to work on their farm. There he meets the ethereal witch Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave who also possesses magical powers. After suffering for years, Amleth finally gets revenge on those who wronged him so long ago. Brutality rages in this film, and it’s not for weak stomachs. Blood, guts, and beheadings continue throughout. This is one of the most intensely violent films I have ever seen, and at times it’s a challenge to watch. Eggers seamlessly incorporates aspects of Viking mythology, from their spiritual beliefs to historical customs. Mysticism and fantasy in the form of valkyries and witches exist in his story, as does the savagery of their way of life in 10th century Iceland. It’s evident that the filmmaking team took their time doing exhaustive research on what it was like at the time in order to make the film as historically accurate as possible. For that reason, it feels like being transported back to the dark, barbaric past. The film gives a real sense of what it must have been like to be alive during that time. The attention to detail is incredibly precise, and the costumes and makeup are jaw-dropping. The performances are phenomenal across the board, from Skarsgård’s primal fury to Kidman’s wicked-tongued mother, there isn’t a dud here. The casting is excellent, and everyone fits their part. The film dives into strange and artsy territory, which may try the patience of viewers expecting no-holds-barred historical action. There are plenty of exciting scenes of bloodthirsty battles, but the script has some unexpectedly thoughtful moments as well. Thank you very much for this encouraging review. I was betwixt and between re watching the film having been a regular viewer of ‘Vikings’. I decided against seeing it and watched my usual fare instead, though I’ll definitely watch when it comes up for hire.
I had the feeling it may have been ‘in the style’ of ‘The Revenant’ which I did not like, due to my reservations with this. Well, it is very much like “The Revenant,” and it is SUPER violent and gory. That was difficult to sit through, but the historical accuracy of the costumes, rituals, etc. is something pretty special. "
"May 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ third film, The Northman, continues his cinematic tradition of creating fanatically detailed, historically grounded worlds so tangible you can practically smell the body odor and see the lice crawling on his characters. The Northman, co-written by Eggers and Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, is basically a Heilung concert in cinematic form, a work of art that is built on contemporary foundations but reaches back into a distant past’s storytelling tradition for authenticity and to tap deeper, earthier emotions, evoking an instinctive response to the unfolding story that twangs not just our heart strings but also ancestral memory of darker, more brutal times. Based on the legend of Amleth, the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet, The Northman is an Icelandic saga come to life, a tale of family, loss, revenge, and pitiless fate from which there is no escape, realized with Eggers’ usual zeal and a nihilistic beauty that threads through the violence and bloodlust as it should in an Icelandic saga. Because of Shakespeare, the bones of the story are recognizable, from the disenfranchised prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard); to the betraying uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang); to the duplicitous queen mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman); to the court jester’s skull; though there is no Ophelia here, instead there is a witch, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who thrives where her courtly counterpart wilts. Amleth witnesses the death of his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), as a child and flees into the vast sea, swearing vengeance on his uncle. Years later, Amleth emerges a man turned into a beast by the pillaging culture of the Norse circa the tenth century, an organized but pitiless society formed around “might makes right”. “Barbarians,” spits one Viking after he and his tribe have scoured a village in the land of the Rus, leaving most dead, the rest enslaved, and the women defiled. It would be funny if the realism of a Viking raid wasn’t so blunt and ruthless in Eggers’ depiction, a fast-moving force of wolf-men bent on the utter destruction of those they perceive as weaker.  Violence is the language of The Northman, and Skarsgard, a hulking physical presence, embodies the Viking essence of man—big, brutal, conquering. In another, dumber film, Skarsgard would be rendered upright, all angles and planes and classic masculine beauty, oiled and lit to perfection for the camera; Amleth would pout his way through his quest more directly aligned with his sulky Shakespearean counterpart. But here he is a beast hunched and hulking, spattered with blood and mud, and Eggers, aided by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, frames him like a monster, muscles bulging with ugly purpose, his face twisted into snarls and inhuman expressions of pain and rage. Skarsgard’s physical performance is astounding, Amleth hardly needs to speak to communicate, but when he does, there are hints of the man he could have been had the Norns not claimed him for a hideous fate as a child. But he is a reflection of the inherent nihilism of Norse religion, in which there is no free will, only the threads the Norns weave, predetermining the outcome of every life. Amleth cannot escape this web, he must fulfill his destiny not because it is honorable, but because it is simply his destiny.  Amleth’s is a soul-crushing world of subsistence farming and merciless pillaging, where even celebratory games are fights to the death. And while Eggers never depicts sexual assault directly, there is no question the women of this world are totally lacking agency, at the mercy—or unmercy—of their husbands and captors, who are often one and the same. The Northman is not a celebration of Viking culture, it is a stark, vicious imagining of life in the Dark Ages. Not even a touch of magical realism can soften this world. Odin is a silent watcher, his ravens damned useful in a pinch but no amount of a god’s favor will save Amleth from his fate, and a Valkyrie’s ride is as thrilling as it is haunting. Whether hallucination or real, the Valkyrie is omnipresent death, waiting to carry off her charges when the Norns snip the last threads of life. There is a constant sense of doom permeating The Northman, from the elemental smoking volcano looming on Iceland’s horizon to the mythical appearance of that Valkyrie, as much a promise of rest as a premonition of death.  With its naked sword fight on top of an exploding volcano, The Northman is rad as hell, its blood-soaked tale of vengeance right in line with the great Icelandic sagas, an epic cinematic rendering of a story that has been told for at least a thousand years. But it is also melancholic, nihilistic, an ugly portrait of a truly dark age. What Eggers has crafted, what Skarsgard inhabits, is a spirit of the Viking age at once complicated and simple. Elaborate, competing religious rites occupy life and death, and people live and die by simple might and the whims of those cruel enough to seize power by any means necessary. But there is also love and renewal and earth magic, and the Norns might be merciless, but the Valkyrie’s final ride is a triumph. Fate is cruel and inescapable in The Northman, and life is carved from the small moments between two people rushing to meet their destinies. As in the best Icelandic sagas, in The Northman death promised is death delivered, and the cycle begins anew."
"May 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,Visually it is darkly stunning&#44; but storywise it is all over the place&#46; Nicole Kidman is one film and Alexander Sharsgard is in another&#46; Anna Taylor-Joy doesn&apos;t know where the heck she&apos;s supposed to be&#46;&#10;
"May 14, 2022",POSITIVE,Eggers&apos; film didn&apos;t resonate with me after I left the theater&#46; I never felt pulled into the orbit of Amleth&apos;s revenge close enough to really empathize with his plight&#46; Gorgeously shot yet oddly hollow emotionally&#46; 
"May 14, 2022",NEGATIVE," I wanted to love Robert Eggers’s follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, but maybe a big-budget Viking saga just isn’t the right fit for a wonderful weirdo like him? I was so looking forward to The Northman, I’m bewildered to report that it didn’t dazzle me, that I gazed on this Viking epic largely unmoved. A serious disappointment. And I like Viking movies. If I can get decent longboats, berserker fights, vengeful slaves, axe-throwing, and the chilling moan of those crazy goat horns, I don’t even mind if stuff gets a little cheesy. Bonus points for Ernest Borgnine in The Vikings (1958) yelling “Odin!” as he leaps into a pit of ravenous wolves, sword in hand. Backed by Universal’s Focus Features, The Northman is Robert Eggers’ first launch into studio filmmaking and mainstream Hollywood, with the director’s previous projects, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), making waves on a much smaller scale as indie horrors. Unfortunately, The Northman’s opening weekend was a box office bomb, bringing in only $12 million domestically — $23 million in total globally — against Eggers’ quoted $70-90 million budget. The Northman is about a glowering, muscle-bound man-mountain named Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, son of Stellan) who as a boy witnesses the killing of his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), and the abduction of his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), by the king’s betraying half-bastard brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth vows revenge. If that sounds vaguely like Hamlet, it’s by design. It seems Shakespeare adapted his play from old Norse sagas, and director Robert Eggers is a stickler for them and Norse history in general, hiring scholars to fact-check him throughout the development process. But first Amleth has to escape, grow up, and channel his hate, “which runs like a freezing river through my veins,” into the berserker lifestyle. Finally, he resumes his quest for revenge, disguising himself as a slave so he can be shipped off with the others to the Iceland settlement run by King Fjölnir, who by now has already lost the kingdom he usurped in Norway. For the first time in an Eggers film, the casting is a distracting problem. In The Witch, the luminous Anya Taylor-Joy in her star-making debut led an inspired ensemble, and in The Lighthouse, Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe gave performances of awe-inspiring conviction in impossibly demanding roles. But in The Northman, dull brooder Skarsgård makes you realize how highly watchable Arnold Schwarzenegger was in Conan the Barbarian (1982), which just happens to be one of Eggers’s inspirations, along with Andrei Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev. Even more frustrating is the fact that frequently standing next to Skarsgård is a far more scintillating actor, Anya Taylor-Joy, who’s given very little to do as Olga, a witchy slave captured in the raid on the Land of Rus by the gang of Vikings that included Amleth. Once in Iceland, Amleth and Olga sneak off frequently behind hillocks to plan their slave revolt. Olga says darkly, “Your strength breaks men’s bones. I have the cunning to break their minds.” Which sounds pretty cool, but unfortunately you sit through the entire film waiting for her to do some mind-breaking, and she never does. She mixes up a batch of hallucinogenic soup at one point, but that’s the extent of it. There’s something so basically off about the whole project, I can only wonder: What happened to you, Robert Eggers? Cowriting with Sjón, an Icelandic poet and novelist, Eggers brings his usual obsession with historical accuracy to bear on the film, cross-checking his script and locations and costumes and props and everything else against what leading scholars say about the North Atlantic at the turn of the tenth century. Eggers’s obsession with minutia led to wild choices like Alexander Skarsgård wearing the same pair of boots throughout the entire shoot, repaired with strips of leather when they fell apart. We must laud these excesses, this fixation on weird-but-true history, because it thwarts the typical Disneyfication of older, stranger worlds that we tend to see in Hollywood. And this approach worked wonderfully in Eggers’s triumphant debut, The Witch, and in his even more daring follow-up film, The Lighthouse. But somehow here it’s run him aground. All through The Northman, it seems as if the Viking epic was directed by someone working in the style of Robert Eggers but without his ability to zero in on the specific shots and scenes to make a compelling vision of the past come alive. In The Witch, it’s those handheld shots from the back of the family wagon, roughly sharing the point of view of the children as their Puritan community’s big wooden gates shut on them, consigning them to their fates in the terrifying seventeenth-century wilderness. In The Lighthouse, it’s those first black-and-white shots (in a vintage, square-shaped aspect ratio) of that godforsaken rock off the coast of 1890s New England. The Northman has all the lavish resources studios can command, and it looks extraordinarily handsome throughout, shot by the same gifted cinematographer as Eggers’s previous films, Jarin Blaschke. It’s got gorgeous scenery, wonderful firelit interiors, cool beards and braids, nice fur wraps, and even Bjork in a small role as a scary seeress. But somehow those key shots that ignite the imagination and deliver you into the power of the narrative never appear. Frankly, I don’t think I will do it again. Even if it means, like, not making a film this big ever again. . . . And by the way, I’d like to make a film this big. I’d like to make one even bigger. But without control, I don’t know. It’s too hard on my person. But he’s also walked back those earlier remarks, insisting that the film represents no loss of authorship and that the studio’s role through postproduction was necessary to achieve the best version of The Northman. Still, it seems clear that he’s ambiguous at best about the process of making big-budget mainstream movies that almost inevitably involve a lot of interference from studio brass. If you read about Eggers’s childhood as a wunderkind encouraged at every turn by intellectual and creative adults to fulfill his potential, it seems he’s had such a rarefied experience overall, it’s made him unlikely to thrive in the meat-grinder system of the mainstream film industry. As Eggers put it himself, when asked why he thought test-screening audiences were having trouble with earlier cuts of The Northman, he said, “Currently, with my best intentions, like, I’m not normal. I look like a poster boy for a Bushwick hipster, but that is where my relatability ends, I fear.” It’s that “I fear” at the end of the sentence that marks Eggers as a reader, a dreamer, one of those obsessive kids who lives in their heads full of art and history and fantasy and as a result talks in unusual phraseology even into adulthood. (Guess how I know!) Eggers admits he was initially indifferent to Norse sagas, which were “too macho for my sensibilities.” It was his wife, clinical psychologist Alexandra Shaker, who inspired him with her love of all that blood-spewing, bonebreaking, honor-killing folklore. And it could be that it’s just not an ideal meeting of writer-director and subject matter. The film’s an honorable failure, in my view, but I also feel a certain urgency in saying that the sooner Robert Eggers goes back to his previous independent mode of filmmaking on subjects that obsess him personally from the start, the better."
"May 13, 2022",POSITIVE," Es un hecho que la industria en Hollywood está cambiando. El que una película como El Hombre del Norte llegue a las salas de cine, con ese reparto, esa manufactura y esa profundidad en su narrativa, es prácticamente producto de una alineación astral vikinga. Robert Eggers forma parte de una generación de directores de género estadounidenses que han demostrado que una nueva narrativa no es ajena al público masivo. Jordan Peele, de la mano de Universal, y Ari Aster, con A24, se han encargado de revitalizar el cine de Estados Unidos al seguir apostando por la experiencia teatral. En el caso de la tercera película de Eggers, El Hombre del Norte, ésta es un evento inmersivo desde sus primeros segundos. Una voz grave y la imagen de un volcán humeante son nuestro primer contacto con la historia trágica de venganza de Amleth. Dicho relato está basado, en cierta medida, en la saga escrita por el historiador medieval danés Saxo Grammaticus en su Gesta Danorum. Estos eventos ocurren en poco más de 20 minutos de iniciada la película, pero Eggers se encarga de presentarnos toda una forma de vida vikinga. Incluso se da el lujo de proyectar un ritual en el que Amleth debe dejar la niñez para convertirse en un hombre con la ayuda de su padre (Ethan Hawke) y Heimir el Tonto (Willem Dafoe). Ya en su etapa adulta, el camino de Amleth (Alexander Skärsgard) naturalmente va a recordar elementos de historias de venganza. Pero prácticamente estamos ante uno de los primeros relatos sobre el camino del héroe hacia su destino, su vendetta. Desde el ya mencionado Hamlet hasta El conde de Monte Cristo, la venganza ha jugado un papel importante en las historias clásicas sobre la redención y la justicia. Para Eggers esto es importante con un personaje que prácticamente debe dejar a un lado su comportamiento animal más básico. Incluso así lo conocemos como un Berserker, guerrero que pelea semidesnudo sólo con pieles de animales. Simplemente tiene que esperar al momento exacto para cobrar venganza y cumplir esa promesa que le hizo a su padre, a su madre y hasta el criminal de su tío. Es entonces donde la línea entre cine de autor y producción de estudio se mezcla, mostrando un resultado como pocas veces vemos en pantalla. En la década de los 60 era común ver en Hollywood superproducciones épicas como Cleopatra o Ben-Hur. A finales de los 90 e inicios del Siglo XXI regresó el género épico brevemente con Corazón valiente y Gladiador, cintas épicas donde precisamente la venganza y justicia juegan un papel importante. Naturalmente todo eso cambia con dos eventos que han modificado el panorama. Las franquicias son las que mandan, con presupuestos grandes o pequeños, pero siempre favoreciendo a los títulos conocidos. Y, por otro lado, el streaming ya ha seducido a más público. Es por ello que algo como El Hombre del Norte es sumamente raro, por no decir único, de ver en pantalla. La visión de un director como Eggers, con una fijación por la historia y los detalles. Y, por otro lado, que una película de ese presupuesto y tamaño se haya producido. El Amleth de Skärsgard desde que lo vemos de niño es noble y bondadoso, es testigo de una muerte que a cualquiera lo dejaría mal psicológicamente (de hecho en la historia escrita por Grammaticus, Amleth finge demencia y así logra estar cerca de su tío para planear su venganza) pero que incluso con todo ese dolor, aún existe humanidad en él. Al igual que Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy),  quien sufre de los estragos de la sociedad vikinga, eso no la deshumaniza ni la convierte en una dama en desgracia, su personaje da pelea y busca tan sólo un lugar en el mundo. Y aunque la historia pueda ser por muchos conocida, Eggers y Sjón logran una dinámica interesante a lo largo de sus actos. Con el ritmo necesario en cada uno de ellos y con algunos giros de tuerca que algunos ya verán venir, la experiencia cinematográfica no disminuye. Al contrario, una vez presentado el verdadero rostro del destino de Amleth, no hay vuelta atrás. La historia toma una dirección hacia la vorágine y acción dignas de cualquier venganza vikinga. En medio de un volcán en lava ardiente y un destino que cumplir. Debido a la crisis sanitaria por COVID-19, en Cine PREMIERE te recomendamos revisar con las autoridades de salud las medidas sanitarias necesarias (especialmente el Lineamiento general para la mitigación y prevención de COVID-19 en espacios públicos cerrados) antes de acudir al cine a ver una película.

"May 13, 2022",POSITIVE,This is a movie that doesn&apos;t shy away from emotions&#44; it embraces them fully&#46; The actors don&apos;t shy away from overacting&#44; either&#44; they revel in it&#44; and this is both refreshing and entertaining&#46;
"May 12, 2022",POSITIVE," He may be known for the arthouse rather than the mainstream but writer/director Robert Eggers' action and ideas are never knowingly undersold. Tone is incredibly important to this Viking tale of revenge, which is so full-on it could easily tip into parody, and Eggers makes his attentions clear from the off with a spot of portentous voiceover and strong visuals - it feels Shakespearean, and so, perhaps, it should, given that its central figure Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) was also the inspiration for Hamlet. Eggers previously tackled American puritanism with The Witch and late 1800s superstition in The Lighthouse, taking an immersive approach to the belief systems in his films. You genuinely feel how much his characters have faith in their gods and their folk tales as an extension of their everyday lives, to the extent that the dividing line between what is real and what is imagined becomes almost nonexistent. His films also have an elemental feel, that's particularly in evidence here, with water present as icy snow and waves, while fire is represented both in ritual and by way of volcano. The story, co-written by Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón is as old as the volcano itself and sees young Amleth witness the death of his Viking king father (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his dad's brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Going on the run, he chants the mantra that basically drives the story: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Eggers' mantra is equally straightforward: ""Go big or go home"". Eggers' approach offers some glorious moments, including an atavistic coming-of-age ritual in which Ethan Hawke and his young co-star Oscar Novak (playing Amleth as a child) bring home the Viking connection to the natural world as they howl like wolves or a viking raid, shot in a long take that brings home its murderous menance. The problem with Eggers' love of a big mood is that, as with all his films, he operates at such a high level of intensity that he has barely anywhere else to go as the action progresses. I longed for some of the subtlety and allegorical underpinning of David Lowery's The Green Knight - hinted at in the film's more mystical moments. Anya Taylor-Joy (who got her break in The Witch) turns up as love interest Olga - not that Eggers has much time for such fripperies, a shame given the matriarchal structures of Icelandic society - while Bjork has an enjoyable cameo as the Viking equivalent of Macbeth's three witches, although I do have to question the casting of Nicole Kidman as Amleth's mother (she is only nine years older than Skarsgård and looks a lot less than). You can also feel the studio at work when it comes to the film's final act, or rather, acts, uncertain whether to offer happiness or tragedy it tries, not entirely successfully, to go for both in a bid to provide something for everyone. There's plenty of might about Eggers' films but I could use a bit more heart."
"May 11, 2022",POSITIVE,The Northman is brutal&#44; bloody and violent&#44; even a little gory at times&#46; But its beautiful aesthetics displayed in every shot and every sequence place it above other movies with similar topics&#46; &#91;REVIEW IN SPANISH&#93;
"May 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Tras La bruja (2015) y El faro (2019), ese director de culto y de moda que es el estadounidense Robert Eggers concibió la película más ambiciosa de su carrera con una épica de venganza inspirada en la mitología vikinga para la que contó con un elenco de lujo y con un generoso presupuesto de 90 millones de dólares. El resultado es imponente desde lo visual, pero no tanto en términos dramáticos."
"May 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," Los vikingos han sido un fenómeno muy popular en nuestra cultura pop contemporánea durante la última década. Aunque ya existen grandes películas de vikingos como Los vikingos (1958), El guerrero número 13 (1999) y la injustamente fallida Valhalla Rising (2009), solo con la serie Vikings (2013 - 2021) se puede hablar de un verdadero hype, que también ha penetrado en el popular mundo del juego con Assassin's Creed Valhalla y God of War, entre otros. Ahora el director de cine estadounidense Robert Eggers también ha hecho uso de este tema. Este director es popular entre los cinéfilos y amantes del cine indie por sus anteriores películas La bruja (2015) y El faro (2019), en las que combina lo histórico con lo oculto de una forma cinematográficamente muy inusual. Para todas sus películas, Robert Eggers lleva a cabo una investigación histórica, lee en profundidad el tema y se deja asesorar por varios expertos. En este caso, entre otros, el reconocido arqueólogo Neil Price, especializado en vikingos y chamanismo. Y así, aunque The Northman es mucho más un thriller de venganza fuertemente mitológico que un recuento de la historia; es, con mucho, la película vikinga más realista en términos de historicidad, desde la ropa hasta la armadura y los ritos. Especialmente con esto último The Northman destaca, ya que otras películas y series nunca han profundizado tanto en la mitología nórdica y sus rituales. Desde el punto de vista de un historiador, lo único que se podría criticar es la falta general de color en la película, como ocurre con la mayoría de las historias ambientadas en la Edad Media. Pero esta frialdad es también el estilo del director, como en este caso. Se agradece que Robert Eggers no haya rodado esta película íntegramente en blanco y negro, como hizo con El faro. Pero hay una gran diferencia con sus dos películas anteriores: esta vez Robert Eggers no ha rodado para el estudio de cine independiente A24, sino para el mucho más grande Universal Pictures. Esto probablemente también le permitió conseguir un presupuesto de 90 millones de dólares, seis veces más de lo que costaron sus dos películas anteriores juntas. Ahora uno podría temer que Robert Eggers haya vendido su alma por el gran estudio cinematográfico, pero aquí podemos dar el visto bueno. Robert Eggers sigue siendo fiel a su estilo y The Northman lleva claramente su firma. Hasta qué punto el estudio ha interferido en sus libertades artísticas, por supuesto, es imposible de decir. En una entrevista, Robert Eggers afirma que sólo hubo compromisos de no mostrar los genitales masculinos para que la película también pudiera proyectarse en otros países como China. Audiovisualmente, se pueden ver y oír los altos costes de producción de la película. La fotografía, la música y el diseño de sonido son del más alto nivel, aunque no cabe esperar nada revolucionario. La película se rodó principalmente en Islandia, pero también en parte en Irlanda debido al coronavirus, con posterior postproducción digital. La trama se esboza rápidamente: en el año 895 d.C., el joven Amleth (interpretado posteriormente como adulto por Alexander Skarsgård) debe suceder a su padre, el rey vikingo Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), en el trono de un pequeño reino. Pero este rey es asesinado por su propio hermano Fjölnir (Claes Bang) para apoderarse de su trono y reino. El joven Amleth debe huir y busca venganza. La historia se basa en la antigua saga danesa de Amletus, que inspiró el Hamlet de William Shakespeare. Seguimos a Amleth, que busca la venganza, en su locura por la sangre, la suciedad y el barro durante más de dos horas. ""Ahora ves el mundo a través de los ojos de un hombre"" le había anunciado su padre a Amleth poco antes de su muerte. Esta cámara asume por completo el papel de sus ojos supuestamente masculinos. Sigue a nuestro personaje principal en todo momento y no permite ninguna distancia. Al igual que Amleth, la cámara se deja capturar completamente por el odio y el fanatismo. El gran problema aquí es que el motivo de la venganza no arrastra al espectador lo suficiente. Para mí, el punto llegó a los 20 minutos, cuando sólo pude seguir la loca sed de sangre de nuestro ´héroe` sin comprender y negando con la cabeza. Probablemente el propio Amleth no cree en su plan de venganza en todo momento. Tras un largo periodo de represión y olvido, primero tuvo que ser persuadido de nuevo por un Norne (una figura fatídica de la mitología nórdica) para llevar a cabo este plan asesino. Tendría una profecía que cumplir. Posteriormente, todas las atrocidades cometidas se justifican por esta profecía hilada por las Norns. Todo esto es extremadamente determinista y parece que no hay forma de salir de este ciclo de violencia y venganza para nadie. En ningún momento Amleth actúa aquí como una persona autónoma; siempre sigue siendo un hombre impulsado. Cuando las cosas no están claras, siempre recurre a las Norns y a las brujas para que le dicten el camino a seguir. El protagonista de la película está manipulado y no es el dueño de su propia historia, aunque la cámara nos lo haga creer. La imagen del héroe aquí es muy anterior a la Ilustración, una imagen realmente contundente y totalmente primitiva. Sin embargo, el elemento psicológico es el que marca el ritmo de la película cuando los límites de la locura se vuelven muy fluidos. En El Faro, esto seguía ocurriendo debido a las circunstancias, el aislamiento y el exceso de alcohol. En cambio, en The Northman, estas secuencias son una expresión de las convicciones de los personajes, especialmente en la conexión con lo mitológico. En el mundo de los vikingos, tal como lo muestra Eggers, la religión no es simplemente un aspecto parcial de la vida, sino que la impregna por completo. Una y otra vez vemos a Amleth o a otros perderse en visiones, mezclando los mundos físico y espiritual. Genial, por ejemplo, es una aparición desgraciadamente muy breve de la cantante de culto Björk como vidente que recuerda al protagonista su destino. La trama de venganza basada en la figura legendaria de Amletus es la parte más débil de la película. Eggers y su coguionista Sjón (Lamb), no consiguen distinguirse de forma significativa de las miles de historias de venganza con las que se inunda el mercado cinematográfico cada año y tampoco parece importarle, ni a sus personajes. Se pueden calificar benévolamente de clásicos. De forma menos benévola, son bastante aburridos y carecen de cualquier forma de caracterización digna de mención. Hay que reconocer que esto es bastante inusual en este tipo de obras históricas. La idea de una personalidad es un poco más reciente. Sin embargo, a veces es difícil mantener el interés por el destino de los personajes individuales. Hasta cierto punto, esto se compensa con el conjunto absurdamente destacado, que una y otra vez tiene momentos de brillantez. Especialmente queda en la memoria un monólogo de Nicole Kidman -que interpreta de forma un tanto irritante a la madre de Alexander Skarsgård después de que ambos aparecieran como matrimonio en Big Little Lies- en una escena clave en la que todo el marasmo se vuelca de nuevo ante el público. No es agradable, pero es aún más fascinante. Justo antes del final habría una oportunidad para que la película rompiera esta ley de violencia contundente y deconstruyera el motivo de la venganza y la masculinidad primitiva en los metros finales: habría una forma de que Amleth escapara de la locura, de que se liberara de la fatídica red de los Norns. Pero la película le prohíbe hacer esta elección. ""Sólo los tontos intentan escapar del destino"". Y como no se nos permite ser tontos, nosotros, como público, seguimos siendo testigos de la locura hasta el amargo y ardiente final. Además, la historia de amor, algo hilvanada aquí y allá, no le toca a uno en absoluto. No es muy creíble y esta película oscura y fría es incapaz de evocar verdaderas emociones. Dado que la violencia ha entrado en nuestro mundo real de la manera más brutal, no podemos evitar ver esta película bajo la influencia de la situación política mundial actual. La lección que debemos aprender de la película: no nos dejemos guiar por un supuesto destino predeterminado, aunque la situación parezca no tener camino ni alternativa. Sí, seamos tontos en la duda,rompamos la rueda de la violencia y la venganza en cuanto haya la más mínima posibilidad de hacerlo. Si no lo hacemos, sólo dejaremos atrás tierra quemada, como en las películas, y libraremos la batalla final a las puertas del infierno (nuclear), donde sólo puede haber perdedores. Debemos tener cuidado de no dejarnos embrujar por nuestras Norns actuales y embarcarnos en un camino brutal y sangriento en el que, a partir de cierto punto, ya no hay vuelta atrás. Porque ya no nos espera ninguna valquiria y las puertas del Valhalla, a diferencia de las del infierno, hace tiempo que se cerraron. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"May 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Su nueva película es épica, masiva y ostentosa, pero lo que ha perdido en intimidad y ambigüedad lo compensa con una dirección sublime y estilizada. El hombre del norte (The Northman, 2022) es una magnífica ópera visual. Su trama, un relato de venganza relativamente primitivo, no esconde grandes sorpresas. Pero hay una indudable cualidad hipnótica en la composición del film: es a la vez bello y horripilante, violento y esotérico, elevado por su cosmogonía y rebajado por el melodrama. Hay un balance delicadísimo de antinomias en juego y Eggers lo ejecuta con la destreza de un maestro de su propio arte. La película adapta la leyenda nórdica que inspiró el Hamlet de Shakespeare, acerca de un príncipe vikingo y su violenta venganza contra el asesino de su padre y captor de su madre. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), un guerrero dedicado a arrasar aldeas poseído por un frenesí sanguinario, es un héroe menos psicológicamente refinado que su contraparte teatral. No hay lugar para la duda o la introspección. La historia es sencilla porque la perspectiva del héroe es sencilla, simplificada por un juramento repetitivo y arengada por visiones fantásticas. Si hay un hilo conector entre las tres películas del director - que habita pasados históricos con la comodidad y verosimilitud de un viajero del tiempo - es este: sus personajes tienden a ofuscar su entendimiento del mundo (y de sí mismos) invocando supersticiones que los terminan destruyendo o trascendiendo, si es que pueden distinguir entre ambos. La bruja (The Witch, 2015) se sirve del folclore puritano para contar su historia de paranoia corruptora. El faro (The Lighthouse, 2019) cita a la mitología griega para contar una críptica fábula de anhelo y represión. Arraigada en un Medioevo brutal en el que una muerte cruel es parte de cualquier buen desayuno o deporte amistoso, El hombre del norte admite a la mitología nórdica en clave de visiones espectaculares, desde criaturas fantásticas hasta la mítica Valhalla y un gigantesco árbol genealógico, tan literal como abominable, similar al Yggdrasil. Todas vienen a justificar la violencia, en definitiva. El camino del héroe es glorificado a la vieja usanza de las sagas pero también es cuestionado, sino por el propio héroe, por quienes lo rodean. Aquí el impulso masculino es acomplejado por la intrusión del escrutinio femenino, en particular Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) y Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), quienes se guardan los mejores monólogos de la película. Hay ritos de sobra dentro de la trama, pero la propia película cobra una dimensión ritual al emular a través del simple accionar de los personajes el ritmo, el ánimo y la mentalidad de una época en particular (excursos mágicos inclusive). En manos de otro director ésta sería una película de venganza más, otro film de acción disfrazado de algo que no es. Robert Eggers y su equipo capturan un mito y lo elevan como sólo podría haberlo hecho el cine."
"May 8, 2022",POSITIVE," There’s a poetry to Robert Eggers’ language. As a storyteller, his incredibly detailed world has a gravitational pull toward excellence. It comes through in his dialogue, camera framing and immersive production design. And although his latest, The Northman, is a classic tale as old as time, Eggers bakes a brutal cake layered with meaning, incredibly rewarding themes, and a grand sense of mystery. Like Eggers’ previous work (The Witch and The Lighthouse), The Northman is wicked and delightfully weird without ever losing its grip on being a compelling character study engulfed in dazzling imagery – and it’s his best film to date. The Focus Features’ Viking epic follows Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) on the verge of becoming a man when his father (Ethan Hawke) is ferociously murdered by his uncle (a terrific Claes Bang of The Square). Amleth’s uncle kidnaps Prince Amleth’s mother (an award-worthy Nicole Kidman), leaving his world upside down as he tries to find his place in it. Raised with tremendous hate in his heart for the next 20 years, Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is ready to exact revenge and take back what’s been stolen from him. Compared to Eggers’ previous two films, The Northman is his most straightforward narrative. However, that doesn’t hinder the experience one bit. Eggers' films are mesmerizing because of the haunting and psychedelic imagery and detail. The Witch and The Lighthouse both feature images that will continue to live on, and The Northman is no different.  There’s a scene involving children that will stick and really upset some people. It’s incredibly dark and brutal, but it raises interesting questions about where the line is for Amleth? He is someone so consumed with hate that he’s strategic about everything, making the basic need to be human feel nonexistent. This is perfectly visualized in a scene where he cries his last tear as a child. And what kind of Eggers movie would this be if it didn’t dip into the supernatural? This is an arena that Eggers excels in as a filmmaker. Anything that feels otherworldly is always grounded because of his navigational skills with tone. He can show you the most disturbing material and still have you eager to see where the story goes.  One terrific duel between Amleth and a giant, undead entity will excite those who have a taste for the weird. But the sequence also pumps the brakes with its follow-through. All these larger-than-life experiences have a reason for going to the extreme. For instance, the fight scene mentioned above could be read as an internal battle to prove Amleth’s worthiness in receiving heroic gifts (like a sword). Eggers is cautious about blurring the lines between fantasy and reality.  Performance-wise, so much can be said about Skarsgård’s beastly take. Not only does he tap into the complex emotions of a man trying to fulfill a promise and have a legacy of his own, but he also brings so much physically to the role that’s intoxicating. One scene when he catches a spear and throws it right back to its sender is chilling. How Skarsgård walks (in a slow, deliberate, and blood-thirsty manner) is something that deserves to be decorated in gold. You’ll believe Amleth’s pain 100 percent. But it is Kidman who gives the most surprising turn of the film. It’s been some time since she’s gone to this level. She accomplishes so much in such little screen time, primarily in a scene near the film’s last third, which is one of the most powerfully constructed and acted moments in any movie ever. You’ll know it when you see it because you’ll feel a fire build within you.  The Northman may not pull everyone in at once, but it will have some serious legs. More and more people will discover it over time, and those who do will sing its praises far and wide. It’s an old story, older than Hamlet. (Hamlet, with his similar sounding name, is actually based on Amleth’s journey.) But there’s such a freshness to its view on fatherhood and what we lose along the way. There’s also a lot to admire and learn, like how the younger generation sees the older generation as having more integrity for having faced a harder world.  From visionary director Robert Eggers comes THE NORTHMAN, an action-filled epic that follows a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father’s murder. With an all-star cast that includes Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe.

"May 6, 2022",NEGATIVE," Directed by Robert Eggers, The Northman follows Viking-era warrior Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as he sets out to avenge the brutal murder of his father (Ethan Hawke’s Aurvandill) at the hands of his own brother (Claes Bang’s Fjölnir). Filmmaker Eggers, working from a screenplay written with Sjón, delivers an often astonishingly impenetrable endeavor that contains few, if any, elements designed to capture and sustain the viewer’s attention, and there’s little doubt, ultimately, that the arms-length atmosphere is compounded (and then some) by an ongoing emphasis on frustratingly (and palpably) indecipherable dialogue – as Eggers has seemingly directed his talented roster of heavily-accented performers to mumble and whisper their way through the picture’s entire, interminable runtime. It is, as a result, not surprising to note that The Northman suffers from a pervasive lack of context that grows increasingly problematic/disastrous as it progresses, with Eggers’ frequent reliance on head-scratching asides and digressions, including a series of laughably pretentious dream sequences, certainly going a long way towards perpetuating the nigh endless vibe. And although Eggers has admittedly peppered the proceedings with a very small handful of engaging interludes (eg Amleth violently storms a small village alongside other Vikings), The Northman builds towards a completely (and hopelessly) underwhelming climax that ensures it concludes on as lackluster a note as one could’ve envisioned – with the end result an epically-misguided trainwreck that couldn’t possibly be less interesting or involving."
"May 6, 2022",POSITIVE," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Robert Eggers es uno de los cineastas más interesantes de los últimos años —un director que no está en lo absoluto interesado en contar historias que se lleven a cabo en la actualidad, más bien enfocándose en el pasado y en personajes y lugares muy específicos. “La bruja”, su primer largometraje, es un excelente filme de terror con una precisión histórica envidiable, y “El faro” se siente como algo extraído directamente de los diarios de marinos y cuidadores de faros del siglo pasado. Para “El hombre del norte” (The Northman), sin embargo, ha regresado incluso más atrás en el tiempo, a la época de los vikingos, inspirándose en el mito que inspiró a William Shakespeare para crear “Hamlet”. Considerando la filmografía y estilo de Eggers, entonces, no debería sorprender que “El hombre del norte” se desmarque de cualquier otra película de vikingos. Ciñéndose, como siempre, a la precisión histórica, pero mezclando lo realista con lo fantástico —especialmente durante secuencias de alucinaciones y sueños—, lo que ha hecho Eggers con esta película es desarrollar una intensa historia de venganza, sin ocultar lo barbárica y sangrienta y brutal que era la vida en aquella época para estas personas. Es por eso que, a pesar de contar con un mayor presupuesto y con más actores que en sus dos películas anteriores, “El hombre del norte” no se siente como un blockbuster tradicional. Se trata, de hecho, de una película de Eggers al 100%, lo cual, desgraciadamente, podría terminar por alienar a aquellos que esperen ver algo más del mainstream. “El hombre del norte” comienza de manera similar a “Hamlet”, pero felizmente se va diferenciando cada vez más de la obra de Shakespeare mientras va avanzando. En el prólogo, vemos a un joven príncipe Amleth viviendo en relativa paz en su pueblo, con su madre, la Reina Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), y cuando regresa de sus aventuras, también con su padre, el despiadado Rey Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Desgraciadamente, su tío, Fjolnir (Claes Bang; ¡gran nombre!) quiere usurpar el trono, por lo que asesina al rey, dejando al chico por muerto. Años después, un Amleth ya adulto (Alexander Skarsgård) ha encontrado a una nueva familia, dedicándose a la violencia y las redadas. No obstante, no ha olvidado la promesa de venganza que se hizo a sí mismo: rescatar a su madre, vengar a su padre, y matar a Fjolnir. Y cuando se le presenta la oportunidad, logra viajar a Islandia, haciéndose pasar por esclavo, para trabajar en la granja de su tío. Es ahí donde conoce a Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), de quien se enamora, y quien lo ayuda a planear el asesinato de su nuevo jefe, para que luego puedan escapar libres y, con algo de suerte, acompañados de Gudrún, quien felizmente sigue viva. Estilísticamente hablando, “El hombre del norte” es una película que trata de recrear la vida y sociedad de los vikingos de la manera más realista y cercana posible. Las locaciones —incluyendo a la impresionante Islandia— contribuyen a que el espectador se transporte a esta época en el pasado, y todo aspecto artístico y estilístico, desde el vestuario hasta el diseño de producción, está lleno de detalles que ayudan tanto a la caracterización de los personajes, como a la narración de la historia. “El hombre del norte” es una película sucia, sangrienta, en donde uno hasta puede oler a los personajes, siempre cubiertos de barro, tierra y tripas. Esto contrasta perfectamente con algunos planos francamente bellos; la suciedad de este mundo y las imágenes impactantes que Eggers y su equipo logran diseñar se complementan de manera inesperadamente efectiva. Esta interpretación verosímil de los vikingos también se ve reflejada en el trabajo de personajes. “El hombre del norte” es una historia interesante porque no está poblada por héroes y villanos; la moralidad de los personajes es relativa, y nada es presentado en blanco y negro. Amleth es nuestro protagonista únicamente porque no es tan salvaje como sus enemigos, pero eso no quiere decir que sea una figura heroica. Igual es capaz de asesinar despiadadamente, y está tan enfocado en la venganza, en el odio, que muchas veces comete errores o toma decisiones que podrían costarle la felicidad o, al menos, la tranquilidad. Una escena en particular, en donde su madre la revela una verdad inesperada, sirve para esclarecer las diferentes perspectivas que estos personajes pueden tener de los mismos eventos, y para terminar por confirmar que nadie en esta película es totalmente bueno o totalmente malo. De hecho, a nivel narrativo, dicha escena sirve para introducir el mejor giro con el que cuenta “El hombre del norte”. Porque fuera de eso, no se trata de una experiencia particularmente compleja a nivel de historia. La premisa es algo que ya se ha visto antes, pero lo que importa acá, más que el “qué”, es el “cómo”. La mezcla de precisión histórica con secuencias visualmente impresionantes —muchas de ellas relacionadas a los sueños y visiones que tiene Amleth— logran otorgarle una identidad muy propia a la cinta, y aunque “El hombre del norte” no se podría describir como una experiencia tradicionalmente divertida, es muy posible que los deje impactados, tanto por lo brutal que puede llegar a ser, como por su conclusión emocionalmente agridulce. Alexander Skarsgård —más musculoso que nunca— está muy bien como Amleth, interpretándolo (especialmente al inicio) como una bestia en cuerpo de hombre, caminando de manera jorobada, matando sin piedad, casi como una máquina. No obstante, resulta interesante ver cómo, hasta cierto punto, se va humanizando y suavizando, pero sin perder de vista su objetivo principal. Anya Taylor-Joy, por su parte, no da una mala actuación, pero a diferencia del resto del reparto, tiene problemas con el acento que intenta darle a su personaje. Claes Bang trata de ir más allá de los clichés con Fjolnir, y a pesar de que no tiene demasiado qué hacer, Nicole Kidman resalta como la Reina Gudrún, especialmente en un par de escenas particularmente intensas. Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, y hasta Björk (como una bruja, porque obviamente) tienen roles pequeños pero importantes. “El hombre del norte” es el tipo de película que ya no vemos con demasiada frecuencia en el cine —un filme que no pertenece a ninguna franquicia ni tiene como protagonistas a superhéroes, y que sin embargo cuenta con un presupuesto relativamente alto, como para cumplir sin problemas con las exigencias del guion. Adicionalmente, es una película para mayores; no es gratuitamente violenta o sexual, pero sí cuenta con momentos sangrientos y con algo de gore, así como escenas breves de desnudos que, felizmente, no abusan del male gaze. Por ende, no me sorprende que no le esté yendo tan bien en la taquilla; es una experiencia difícil de vender, pero si se animan a darle una oportunidad, estoy seguro que saldrán de la sala de cine igual de impactados que este servidor. “El hombre del norte” es, pues, de lo más memorable que podrían ver este año, y una experiencia que vale la pena tener frente a una pantalla grande."
"May 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Northman falls short of being an epic film, but the mastery in composition of the film is noteworthy."
"May 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Execution&#44; performance&#44; and art direction are all unparalleled&#44; but the whole simply proves a solid familial melodrama in the end&#46; They can&#8217;t all be &quot;great&#46;&quot;
"May 5, 2022",POSITIVE," Those familiar with HAMLET will find some familiar things in Robert Eggers’ THE NORTHMAN, and that is no coincidence. The source material for both is Sjón’s Gesta Danorum (circa 1200) about a prince with both mommy issues and a usurping uncle. Where Shakespeare adapted the story to his time creating an elegantly and eloquently melancholy protagonist, Eggers has embraced the wildness of the original, creating a world of primal ritual where the spirit realm regularly interacts with the material one, and life is nasty, brutish, and short. Mercifully so, if we can take the word of Amleth’s father, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), whose fondest hope is to die in battle rather than be disgraced by lingering into decrepit old age. It does give a whole new cast to the ending, and if only for that, Eggers is to be highly commended. This Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), more direct in his speech and far less elegant by modern standard, is the beloved son of Aurvandil and Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). On the last sunny day of his childhood, his father newly returned from battle with the spoils of same, takes young Amleth to an overnight, underground ritual that will mark him as his heir and usher him into manhood. The mind-altering substance involved along with the burps and farts that separate humans from the beasts, affords fantastic visions (the first of many in a film dense with symbolism and savagery), and bonds father and son so tightly that when brother and Uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) sets upon them as they leave the ritual caverns, it commits Amleth to a life pledged to avenging his father, saving his mother from the rapacious Fjölnir, and killing said rapacious Fjölnir. It is the invective the young prince spews as a mantra as he rows away from certain death into the Land of the Rus. Years pass, and the young man, now grown to ferocious manhood as a warrior pillaging the countryside, learns the fate of his treacherous uncle. He summarily decides to pass himself off as a slave in order to infiltrate the king’s exile settlement in Iceland, and take his revenge. He meets the sly and subte Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave who isn’t fooled by his disguise, but who is taken with his plans and offers to break minds the way Amleth plans on breaking bones. Eggers spares us little of what made Northmen (aka Vikings) so feared. The scenes of just how the Rus decimate a peaceful village without mercy or even much thought as to the humanity of their victims, is the stuff of nightmares. This Amleth is no scholar home from university dithering about what to do. This is a killing machine whipped into a Berserker. Skarsgård embodies the physicality effortlessly and imbues this tortured soul with an equally tortured emotional state. He simmers with rage while mouthing humility to his new masters, and evokes the psychic scars of remorse when seeing his mother again for the first time since the fratricide. There is also a complexity to his relationship with Olga, at first latching on to her only as an instrument of revenge, and then slipping into an attachment without sentiment, yet with a similarly seething passion. This is a character of his time and place, certainly made unsympathetic to us by his actions. Yet Skarsgård, while never mitigating Amleth’s warrior code, still makes of Amleth a sympathetic character, capable of invoking our sympathy by keying into the part of Amleth that is resonant in his plight. It’s a subtle performance in a film that is ferocious, and all the more effective for it. The spirit world and the material world share the same psychic space here, such that no raven is merely a bird, and a Valkyrie with graven teeth flying Amleth through the air to meet his fate is no more unusual than a seagull floating over the landscape. In a place where dismembered corpses provokes no horror beyond the disrespect inflicted on one’s honor, and where human sacrifice is little more noteworthy than any other kind, the spirit world’s hold is not only credible, but a necessary component in the context that Eggers provides. The mystical is an explanation and a release, not unlike the orgiastic rituals and the proto-cricket played with extreme prejudice. When death is merely a transition from one reality to another, the fleeting nature of life is a given, and not something about which to fret. As in the case of Aurvandil, death, achieved honorably and in one’s prime, a gift. THE NORTHMAN is a dark tale told with precision and wonder. It is a brutal experience for the viewer, forceful and forthright in its vision, but it is an experience that is more than mere entertainment, because it does more than merely immerse us in an alien culture that is abhorrent by modern standards. It makes it sensible on many levels. We might never want to spend a day, or even an hour, in this place and this time, but there is something about the easy communion with the invisible world that is aspirational. Plus a hero every bit as complex as the one with which Shakespeare gifted us."
"May 4, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers has quickly made a name for himself in Hollywood thanks to his first two features, the somber yet entrancing horror films The Witch and The Lighthouse. But with his third feature, The Northman, Eggers has definitively proved that he’s a cinematic force to be reckoned with. The Northman is a revenge tale based loosely on a Viking legend, and it allows Eggers to lay bare his ambitious, sweeping vision with emphatic determination and well-earned confidence. The story itself is as predictable as most movies about retribution, but the fact that this movie is nonetheless bewitching despite its predictability is the most telling testament to Eggers’ unique and effective style of storytelling. Set mostly in a small kingdom off the coast of Ireland sometime in the 9th Century, The Northman opens as King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns to his wife, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), and their young son, Prince Amleth, who encounters bizarre beings such as a he-witch played by Willem Dafoe, and a Seeress (who may not even have eyes) played by Icelandic singer Björk. The King is soon struck down in his prime before his son’s very eyes, and though the boy runs away to spare himself the same fate, he eventually grows up to be a man hellbent on avenging his father’s murder. Played as an adult by Alexander Skarsgard in a career-best role, Amleth sets out to find the target of his vengeance — his own murderous uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Given the rather simple setup, it doesn’t take a Seeress to know what you can reasonably expect to occur over the next two hours. Amleth knows he is fated to die at the Gates of Hell, but not before he rescues his mother and kills his uncle. Anna Taylor Joy also shows up to lend the proceedings some additional intrigue as a mysterious sorceress peasant, but the role proves ultimately pointless, and The Northman proceeds almost exactly as you expect it to from start to finish. That said, Eggers and his co-writer, Icelandic poet Sjón, earn the film’s leisurely running time, as they make this familiar story utterly captivating. The point, clearly, is the journey, and not Amleth’s fateful destination. That trek is created by Eggers’ confident camera and Jarin Blaschke’s vigorous cinematography as well as Louise Ford’s seamless editing, and Sebastian Gainsborough’s heart-pounding score. Other talented veterans from Eggers’ first two films include Costume Designer Linda Muir and Production Designer Craig Lathrop. This gifted below-the-line group works in harmony together and the gorgeous final product reflects both their devotion to the project and their dedication to each other. Muir designs the Viking-style costumes you might expect, but she accentuates her characters with various flourishes such as headpieces and other bits of armor that denote a heightened sense of importance. Lathrop gives you fireplaces, sheds where a lot of scary and important things happen, a witch’s cavern, and a mighty volcano appropriately called Hel, while Ford takes you from fast-paced action to panoramic still shots of the incredible vistas that Blaschke captures. In the background, Gainsborough’s soundtrack insists that this story is epic and that more is at stake than simply “fate” or “honor.” After all, Prince Amleth is widely understood to be the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet, so much is riding on his swole shoulders. Of course, this story would not be nearly as interesting were it not for the equally capable actors who help Eggers tell it. Skarsgard and Bang are two of Scandinavia’s best working thespians today, and what can one say of tireless Aussie Nicole Kidman? Though the amalgam of accents that these actors of different nationalities employ at times teeters dangerously close to House of Gucci territory, most of the action in Eggers’ screenplay is thankfully on the battlefield or in the shadows, and there is insufficient dialogue to grate the senses with a spoken mélange of tones. At the end of the day, these three actors, as well as Dafoe and Taylor-Joy, triumph with their expressions and visceral movements, and The Northman conveys the same grandiose consequentiality that any of Shakespeare’s royal tragedies do. Few will walk out of The Northman without taking something memorable with them. Though the inherent predictability of revenge movies, with their familiar themes of fate and destiny and excessive use of animal symbolism (in this case ravens and goats), can often result in a heavy-handed movie, that is fortunately not the case with Eggers’ third film. Thanks to Eggers’ confident manner of storytelling, one that permits his brilliant cast to meld seamlessly with the monumental efforts of numerous craftspeople, The Northman is one of the most impressive if not downright haunting movies to hit theaters in quite a while."
"May 4, 2022",POSITIVE," The environment of The Northman is one of ice and fire, one where it’s difficult to imagine anything beyond cloudy skies, dirt & mud, windy days, and volcanic nights. And such an environment, of course, breeds a kind of man who fights as if dominated and possessed by the elements. Knights of ice and fire, they could be. Director Robert Eggers, after his previous effort The Lighthouse, continues his exploratory thread of male gender politics and bonds, if by way of ripped abs and pure vengeance. No matter how potentially challenging, his movie is a revenge action picture first and foremost, crafted out of iron and sorcery, delivered to a moviegoing world that demands the familiar and the colorful. Revenge is familiar and colorful, but the landscape is cloudy and bleak, smothered in the smog of smoke. This is a film that gives what is wanted, without any regrets, through an environment that’s as angry as it is awesome. Nothing about The Northman is unattainable to standard observation. It’s all simple to gather if dressed up with the legend of spells and rituals. The young prince of a Viking kingdom goes on the run after witnessing the murder of his father and the kidnapping of his mother at the hands of his uncle, vowing to avenge his fallen family and to kill anyone and everyone in his way, living for nothing more. Growing up to become an ax-wielding pack of muscles in the form of Alexander Skarsgard, the prince covers his animalistic intent with the sheepskin veil of a mild-mannered slave in order to fulfill his fate and end his journey. A standard tale, but boldly told. Moviegoing with Bill is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts, get exclusives, join my Movie Club, and support my work, consider becoming a paid subscriber. Skarsgard plays this prince with a hulking presence, speaking as if to grunt and shout - at least at first. It’s celebratory how well he’s able to transition the character back into a human being and thinking individual after years and years as an instinctual beast. It’s through both his long-form hunt and his meeting with a young handmaiden slave, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The Northman bludgeons and brutalizes and casts much magic, but it’s in the performance of Joy, whose role is on a path towards freedom and life and genius, that a kind of grace is found. No duh, but absolutely fine as is. Joy shines with intensity when calm and control when intense. She’s come so far from her revelatory turn in Eggers’s The Witch, pushing herself further and further, if in baby steps. Slow and steady. It would be a shame to write about the acting in this film without mentioning its best-performed sequence, between Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman. There’s a spectrum between Joy and Kidman’s female characters, both with a kind of push and pull on the prince’s very soul. Kidman’s queen and mother, when confronted by her son, becomes yet another obstacle and source of sorcery for Skarsgard to conquer. But, at this moment, he stalls like a stunned child. Kidman exerts such frightening and non-resonant power, by which I mean hardly anyone could relate to the game she’s playing. At least, no one would want to admit relating to that. And that’s an amazing feat.  When your movie begins with a foreboding shot of a premature (feels like it) volcanic eruption and a snarly and growly voice-over, you’re setting up for something that rarely could be lived up to. Something absurdly visionary, born of nightmares and male genetic jackhammering. True to this design, The Northman achieves this kind of ethereal environment and, surprisingly, another - something that resembles a high definition video game story mode. I couldn’t help but think of Crazy Samurai Musashi, a one-take sword-swiping escapade that’s more gameplay than narrative when watching The Northman. There is no second-hand experience with this film though; I didn’t feel as if I was impatiently watching my brother play something exciting. The excitement this time out was playing for me and me alone. "
"May 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Drenched in testosterone&#44; Northman is less concerned with reinventing the wheel with it&apos;s narrative built on the same mythology that inspired Hamlet&#44; but rather with making you feel the visceral human anger and rage underpinning it&apos;s entire proceedings&#46; 
"May 3, 2022",POSITIVE," In director Robert Eggers’ (“The Lighthouse”) latest, the ripped Swede portrays a Viking hell-bent on revenge alongside Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, and Björk. Robert Eggers crafts ancient fairy tales drenched in torment and madness, and The Northman proves a fable of fire, blood and fury that expands the ferocious scale of his folk-horror cinema. Fuming with a rage so fearsome as to be otherworldly, the latest from the director of The Witch and The Lighthouse is at once a kindred spirit to those masterful predecessors and a turning point for the 38-year-old auteur, employing his trademark aesthetics and atmosphere for a more streamlined and archetypal story about a Viking prince on a quest for revenge against his treacherous uncle. Coated in dirt and muck and stained in swaths of crimson, it’s a grand and gruesome epic of destiny and decapitations, malevolence and magic—a death-metal ode to honor, retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly, and thrillingly, positive light. With ripped abs and a cold, single-minded stare, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is a man without a home or a clan, living among other Viking marauders who believe themselves to be lycanthropic beasts, howling at the moon like wolves and roaring at the sky like bears around blazing campfires. By the time we meet Amleth, we already know what’s made him so feral, courtesy of an introductory 895 AD passage that focuses on the ordeal suffered by the young Amleth (Oscar Novak) years earlier, when his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returned home from battle to his Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Aurvandill is an aloof monarch to his wife but he exhibits rugged affection for his son, taking him to a forest temple where—under the guidance of court jester and spiritual shaman Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe)—they participate in a hallucinatory pagan ritual that links man to animal and allows Amleth to spy the Tree of Kings, which resides within their bloodline. Though Amleth is heir to the throne, his world is shattered when, following this mind-melting experience, his father is set upon and slain by Fjölnir in an act of betrayal that will forever shape the prince’s path. The Northman’s set-up is pure Conan the Barbarian, replete with heads being separated from shoulders by mighty blades in the snowy woods, and like John Milius’ 1982 gem, Eggers’ film carries itself like a legend, full of hulking mass and import (the only nod to historical reality is a brief mention of King Harald Fairhair). From the armor and fur cloaks worn by Aurvandill, to the mist and smoke that cover this chilly landscape, to the crunching footsteps of the men and horses that traverse it, the action moves like a lumbering goliath, trudging onward toward ruin, mayhem and tragedy that’s as inevitable as the rotation of the Earth. There’s mammoth weight to this saga, and once it shifts its attention to Skarsgård’s grown Amleth, that heft is embodied by its protagonist, who screams and bellows with a vehemence that’s also expressed through bludgeoning combat. From the desolate look on his face, it’s apparent that Amleth’s days of killing and pillaging are only temporary, and they conclude following an encounter with a blind Seeress (Björk, as mesmerizingly weird and chilling as expected) who prophecies that his fate is to avenge his father’s assassination on a fiery lake with a mythic steel sword, at which point a maiden king will assume the crown. This compels Amleth to join up with a group of slaves bound for the Icelandic homestead of Fjölnir, who despite his fratricidal perfidy has been reduced to living life as a farmer. In this group, Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), an imprisoned woman who speaks in outmoded tongues to the god of the soil, and together, they conspire to achieve Amleth’s ends, along the way falling in love. Amleth seeks to save his mother and murder his uncle, and he takes a slow-burn approach to serving Fjölnir his just deserts. Fjölnir doesn’t know Amleth’s true identity, and he and his arrogant and unworthy sons treat Amleth as a lowly piece of property. Much of The Northman’s middle passages involve the Viking’s acts of sly insurgence and stealthy terror, including dismembering two guards and impaling them against a hut in the shape of a steed. Everything builds toward inevitable hellfire and doom, and Eggers stages it with a methodical, head-down resolve that echoes the determination of Amleth, whom the magnetic Skarsgård turns into a figure of obsessive purpose, convinced that felling his disloyal uncle and liberating his mom are his sole reasons for existing, and will grant him the peace and freedom he’s never known. The Northman immerses itself in a pit of anguish and anger, equal parts mystical Valkyrie-and-Valhalla dreams and gritty real-world nightmares, and Eggers evokes it with his usual array of silky and muscular camerawork and gray-black imagery (via cinematographer Jarin Blaschke), as well as a Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough score of thunderous malice (here, punctuated by bagpipes). His cast is highly attuned to the dour and demented atmosphere he’s conjured; a merciless Bang and cruel Kidman tap into the ugliness of this bygone world, Taylor-Joy radiates holy hope as the sole person committed to Amleth’s enterprise, and Dafoe exudes a familiar brand of maniacal deviance. Noseless soldiers, human sacrifices, undead warrior kings and packs of wolves and birds (the latter imbued, as in The Lighthouse, with menacing spiritual power) are additional elements of this grim stew, which Eggers transforms into a primeval portrait of the desire to wrathfully redress past wrongs that can never be undone. Amleth executes his mission with ghastly resolution, and if The Northman boasts less of the delirious, spiraling lunacy of The Lighthouse, it makes up for it with broad-shouldered, battering-ram savagery shrouded in flickering gloom. His tableaus of agony and wonder enhanced by unsettling CGI, Eggers spins a yarn that’s 1,000 years old and yet pulses with timeless ire, his story locating the sweet spot where the archaic and the new seamlessly intertwine. Moreover, while his film adheres to the tenets of its chosen genre, it eschews the moralizing that often defines it, instead embracing the notion that vengeance can fuel a righteous cause rather than merely be an annihilating force that destroys the vengeful. There’s horror and insanity in The Northman’s vision of predestined reckonings, and also beauty in its final contention that some ordained undertakings are worth the blistering, brutal cost."
"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE," In early June Netflix is having a “Geeked Week,” featuring a lot of content geared towards genre fans. But it looks like that moment is already here, given the arrival of two films that could hardly be more custom-tooled towards a particular kind of cult cinephile, and which have both been eagerly awaited by that demographic for some time. Both could be nutshelled as “action movies,” but neither are exactly within the range of “normal” for that genre: One is by a bona fide auteur (and no, Michael Bay’s Ambulance a couple weeks ago did not count), while the other is, well, about as postmodernist as such things get. Robert Eggers has acquired considerable cache by directing two chamber-scaled period horror films that were really psychological thrillers, at least until the end. (And even then, you could argue whatever supernatural events occurred were only hallucinated by characters pushed past sanity.) 2015’s The Witch was an extraordinary portrait of religious fear and fanaticism amongst an exiled settler family in 1630s New England.  Three years later The Lighthouse, with Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattison as island station keepers going mad from isolation in the 1890s, was equally striking if arguably a mite less successful as a whole. Both were singular visions that had an uncompromising severity of style, atmosphere, and story content—something hard enough to pull off at all, let alone excite a fairly large general audience with. The Northman is something else entirely, though, a big, long, starry sword-and-sorcery epic that probably cost five or six times the combined production budgets of those prior features. It begins in the Ireland of 895 AD, as King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns from conquests abroad, eager to reunite with Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) and their son Prince Amelth (Oscar Novak), who at age 1o or so is considered ready to undergo a ritual passage to manhood under the guidance of his father’s holy fool Heimir (Dafoe). But soon after Aurvandill is murdered by his own jealous sibling Fjolnir (Claes Bang), forcing the boy to flee or be killed himself. When we next meet Amelth, he is played by the strapping Alexander Skarsgard, and is part of a roving band of bloodthirsty barbarians, raiding villages for loot and sport. He abandons that mercenary lot to pose as a captured slave upon learning that Fjolnir and Gudrun are now living in Icelandic exile. He then sets about proving himself “loyal” in many ways to gain access to the fallen royal couple, all the while scheming revenge—for his dead father, and for his presumably unwillingly-remarried mother. It’s a brutal, very masculine world, in which The Witch’s Anya Taylor-Joy (as a Slavic slave-sorceress-love interest) and Icelandic icon Bjork (in a glorified cameo as “The Seeress”) have the sole other female roles of note, ones that might easily have been cut with little change to the central plot. You can tell Eggers and co-scenarist Sjon were as scrupulous as possible about period veracity; like the director’s previous films, this one is visually arresting in ways that emphasize the physical challenges of landscape, custom, and era. All the performances are strong. Skarsgard was born for this kind of role, as he’s got the requisite awesome physique and heroic handsomeness, as well as the acting chops to create a credible real-world character rather than a cartoon action figure like Conan the Barbarian.

Yet impressive as it is in all these departments, The Northman—which the director did not have final cut control over, calling its post-production process “painful”—never quite transcends genre the way Eggers has before. It is an exceptionally serious (even humorless) Dark Ages spectacle of combat, adventure, and Shakespearean intrigue, with a dash of magic. But while it lacks the pulpier qualities of “Game of Thrones” or “The Vikings,” it nonetheless doesn’t land far enough from them in gist, nor from big-screen “muscleman” epics stretching from Steve Reeves to Schwarzenegger. Eggers hasn’t quite elevated the familiar conventions such that they become something else entirely, the way David Lowery did with the Arthurian saga in last year’s The Green Knight. Of course, you don’t hand someone $75-90 million and expect them to deliver anything in the realm of 1967 Czech Marketa Lazarova or Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2009 Valhalla Rising, two brutally “pure,” near-abstract representations of medieval hardship. That would be financial suicide. But for all its pagan mysticism, intelligent detail, and frequent beauty, The Northman ultimately feels like a fairly formulaic costume revenge tale—one with higher pretensions than most, to be sure, but not so much of a higher effect. It’s a good movie, yet also a little disappointing, because it’s not quite good enough to get away with being so little fun. There’s really nothing but fun on the agenda in The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, which also opens in theaters nationwide Fri/22. Its central joke is, well, Nicolas Cage: Playing Nicolas Cage, semi-washed-up movie star, still starring in a whole lot of movies (most recent years he’s released about six per), their very erratic quality considered part of his charm—and of his self-harm. Given that he was known almost from the start for giving peculiar, over-the-top performances (even in mainstream hits like Peggy Sue Got Married or Moonstruck, but especially in quirkfests like Vampire’s Kiss, Wild at Heart and Raising Arizona), it seems rather astonishing in retrospect that for a while there, this weirdo was one of the most popular actors in the world, starring in at least a few of the most middle-of-the-road entertainments imaginable, from 1996’s The Rock to 2004’s National Treasure. But it didn’t last, and his increasingly busy, decreasingly selective filmography (purportedly encouraged by very spendy offscreen ways) gradually turned him into a sort of professional novelty act. How gonzo would he be this time? How random could his eccentricities get? Would they actually relate to the movie they’re in, or not? Will he elevate it, or sink it? Or if he’s in an infrequent earnest mode, will the effect be touching, or just seem disinterested? I have really enjoyed some Nic Cage performances and movies in recent years (chief among them Mandy, Mom & Dad, and last year’s Pig), but he remains a true wild card—not only in that you don’t know what he’ll do, but you don’t know whether what he does will be good for the movie, or even for Nicolas Cage. Unbearable Weight has the clever if risky (see: the cautionary example of Burt Reynolds’ 2017 quasi-swan song The Last Movie Star) idea of having its star basically play himself. Well, he is playing himself, Nicolas Cage, albeit a version that apparently took some arm-twisting before he was willing to accept: Endlessly self-absorbed, pretentious about his art (and its applied “shamanic thespian instincts”), very sensitive about criticisms re: his career trajectory, a bit too eager to please, borderline desperate to get “the role of a lifetime” that would put him back on top (but which he may be too no-longer-hot to win). In other words, exactly the mix of larger-than-life swaggering celebrity and terminally insecure basketcase we might well imagine Cage to be. That’s the Cage 2.0 director Tom Gormican and co-scenarist Kevin Etten levy upon a long-suffering fictive ex-wife (Sharon Horgan) and teenage daughter (Lily Sheen) who are really fed up with his shit. Particularly after he reacts to a professional setback by getting very drunk and extremely embarrassing at the latter’s 16th birthday party. Just as well, then, that the next gig arranged for him by agent Neil Patrick Harris is not a movie but a paid personal appearance at the estate of a rich Spanish superfan, alleged olive grower Javi (Pedro Pascal). Yes, it is demeaning to parade one’s nearly-60-year-old self before complete strangers and pretend to be their “friend” just for a $1 million paycheck. But such are the travails of a former-A-list actor. Belying his luxurious digs and high security, turns out Javi appears a pretty nice guy, as well as a sincerely flattering fan. And despite the occasional harassing inner-voice snark from his younger self (“Nicky,” Cage digitally youthified to the mid-1980s), our protagonist has started to actually enjoy this sojourn when he is informed by two CIA agents (Tiffany Hadish, Ike Barinholtz) that they require his cooperation. Javi, they say, is in truth a “violent international arms cartel” chief whose goons just kidnapped the teenage daughter of a Latin American president he wants ousted. The captive girl may even be held on the premises where the star of Face/Off and Con Air is currently boozily suntanning.  For America, for love of decency, he must use his acting skills to make like a spy, perhaps even an action hero to save her. What could be easier? How many times before has he played that kinda part? Could it be so hard to do “for real”? Needless to say: Oh yes it could. Unbearable Weight is not deep, but it juggles a lot of balls rather delightfully, paying affectionate homage to its “fucking legend” star while also ridiculing him (and letting him ridicule himself), operating as an actual action movie while parodying the genre. There are a bazillion references to past Nicolas Cage films—you might even say the passage in which he and Pascal trip on LSD is one long bow to his screen gonzo-dom. Yet a measure of the film’s essential good naturedness is that the best cinephile in-joke here is a running gag reference to a movie he had nothing to do with: Paddington 2, the cuddly 2017 sequel that could well be the single best feature film of the last decade no childless adult ever even thought about watching.  Why is it plugged so incongruously in this goofy fan-flick for grownups? Well why not?! Paddington 2 really is all that. And The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent only makes itself even more agreeable for saying so.The Northman and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent both open at theaters throughout the Bay Area on Fri/22. 48 Hills welcomes comments in the form of letters to the editor, which you can submit here.

"May 2, 2022",POSITIVE," The tale of Amleth, or the legend that inspired it, was the inspiration for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” Titled “The Northman” in this Robert Eggers version, the two stories have much in common.  Eggers is both a researcher and a filmmaker. His movies “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” were based on writings from the eras in which they were set. He wrote this one with the Icelandic poet Sjón to create an accurate depiction of Viking life. The tale is set just before 930 A.D. We meet Amleth as a boy whose father (Ethan Hawke) initiates him as a prince in a ceremony conducted by a shaman (played by an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe.) The boy runs away, and is said to be dead. But Amleth survives on his rage, and vows to avenge his father, kill his uncle and save his mother. Amleth grows into a strong, violent brute, killing almost at will while he wanders. After he discovers his uncle and mother now live in Iceland, he poses as a slave to reach them.  It wouldn’t be fair to tell you the rest of it. Although it is not a fantasy, it does involve fortunes being told – I was reminded a couple of times of The Weird Sisters – and ritual, as well as a magical sword. The performances, not surprisingly, are superlative, and so are the visuals. Watch the details in the objects and the extras who populate the environments. Eggers has created a stunning, harsh world.

"May 1, 2022",NEUTRAL," With an obsessive attention to historical detail and a fascination with lore, language, and ritual, there is no mistaking THE NORTHMAN for the work of anyone but Robert Eggers (“The Witch” “The Lighthouse”). But despite a bigger budget and a much bigger canvas, does the director’s new Viking revenge epic add up to anything but a bloody good time? Along with that review, Adam and Josh return to the Buster Keaton Marathon with the actor/director’s first masterpiece, 1924's SHERLOCK JR."
"May 1, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is a film that’s right up my alley. From the setting to the buckets of blood spilled over the 2+ hour runtime, it’s a violent, visceral, and engrossing voyage. And I was hooked for every minute of it. It also continues to mark Robert Eggers as a director to watch. Additionally, fans of his work on The Witch and The Lighthouse are probably purchasing their tickets as we speak. But what makes this film worth a watch? Here are three reasons why you should watch The Northman. Eggers has worked with some of Hollywood’s most prolific actors, including Anya-Taylor Joy and Willem Dafoe. The Northman boasts what may be his most impressive cast yet including those two. The narrative focuses on Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), who seeks vengeance against his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) for murdering his father Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) and kidnapping his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Along the way, Amneth encounters the witch Olga (Joy), and the two form a partnership that quickly grows romantic. Much of the cast has previously starred in genre fare. Skarsgard is best known for his role in HBO’s True Blood, while Hawke is playing Arthur Harrow in Moon Knight and Bang portrayed Dracula in the BBC’s adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel. And as mentioned before, both Joy and Dafoe have had roles in Eggers’ previous films and show up here – Dafoe shines in a brief role as Heimir the Fool, who despite his name is responsible for sending Amleth on the path to manhood. Skarsgard himself carries the film on his extremely ripped shoulders. He runs through a gauntlet of emotions, from fury to sorrow to passion. And his chemistry with Joy is electric. Another reason to watch The Northman? Well, the film has been described as “Arthouse Conan The Barbarian” and that’s not far off, as the fight scenes in this film are extremely grisly. Heads are hacked off, warriors are impaled, and literal blood and guts fly across the screen. One warrior even has his nose bitten off in a particularly gruesome scene. However, the end fight is truly amazing – I don’t want to spoil what happens, but it’s definitely worth the price of admission. What really makes the fight scenes stand out is how Eggers and his go-to cinematographer Jarin Blaschke stage them. A fight in a tomb features a shining beam of moonlight, which bathes a brutal fight scene in unusually soft lighting. Another scene features snow covering a forest, which serves as prelude to slaughter. This movie may be brutal, but it’s also surprisingly beautiful – and shows that Eggers made good use of the $90 million budget. With a narrative that takes place in the time of Vikings, and a screenplay that was co-written by Icelandic poet Sjón, it’s only natural that Norse myth plays a role in The Northman. Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, is often referred to and even features in a dream sequence as a glowing tree comprised entirely of light, with bodies hanging from its branches. Another dream sequence features a Valkyrie riding through the sky, her face contorted in a roar of primal fury. Not only does the use of Norse myth play into the setting, but it also continues a trend of surreal imagery that’s permeated all of Eggers’ films. These are just a few of the reasons why you should watch The Northman. it hits that sweet spot between “arthouse cinema” and “adrenaline-pumping revenge film”, and like Everything Everywhere All At Once proves that indie features can appeal to mainstream audiences. The Northman also marks a trio of new releases including The Bad Guys and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, which proves that there is a wealth of options in the theaters besides superheroes and remakes. Born and raised in Texas, Collier “CJ” Jennings was introduced to geekdom at an early age by his father, who showed him Ultraman and Star Trek: The Next Generation. On his thirteenth birthday, he received a copy of Giant Size X-Men #1 and dove head first into the realm of pop culture, never looking back. His hobbies include: writing screenplays and essays, watching movies and television, card games/RPG’s, and cooking. He currently resides in Seattle.

"Apr 30, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers is behind the camera in this historical epic that seems to have appeared on cinema screens with little fanfare. This in itself is strange, as the film is by nature a bombastic and energetic presentation that revels in its own energy, and embraces everything that such a film can represent. Apparently, Eggers and the film’s lead Alexander Skarsgard wanted to do a Viking movie together, so The Northman became a labor of love for both artists. The story of revenge is a well worn one, but the setting and mystical presentation of the themes elevate this production for audiences that may initially feel they have seen this story done before, and despite the criticism from some that the accents are a bit weird, the performances here are well above average with the no-compromise direction producing a visceral and often shocking finished product. With a cast that includes Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Nicole Kidman, and Anya Taylor-Joy, it seems incredible that with a budget of just 70 million, the film pulls itself together so satisfyingly. Admittedly a lot of the bigger names here provide just slightly more than cameos, but you can’t help wonder if some of the cast worked here for cheap. Skarsgard plays Amleth, the Northman of the title, who witnesses the murder of his father by his uncle, in a Shakespearian style plot point, and is forced to flee as his uncle takes control of his brother’s land. He vows revenge, and we follow his journey towards a final confrontation. The film manages to juggle all the tropes you might expect in this kind of film, with some very stylistic directorial flair that elevates this to a more artistic production than you might expect. If you are of a certain age, you may remember the Robin of Sherwood TV show from the 80s. The show reimagined the Robin Hood legend and used mysticism and magic to add new nuances to it. Well watching The Northman, you get a similar feeling. Basically, this is a violent tale of revenge, yet we are presented with witches, visions, and often MCU levels of action sequences, that blend perfectly. The balance between some truly violent imagery and the more fantastical lifts the screenplay away from your basic historical adventure into a more complex narrative. Exciting and sprawling, The Northman is almost a throwback to an earlier time of movie-making, with a story of redemption, presented in a fascinating and spellbinding way. Impossible to turn away from, this movie has style and substance and is probably in my top ten films of the year so far. Its one problem is perhaps its run time, which could have possibly been trimmed down just slightly to tighten up the final act, but apart from that, this is a triumph of action-adventure filmmaking that you should check out if you like this type of thing.

"Apr 30, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers again reminds us that he hasn’t adopted filmmaking as merely a vocation but a platform to tell stories that haven’t been told – or in the least, told LIKE THIS, with his 10th century Icelandic actioner The Northman. In what can only be described as a brutal, testosterone-fueled profusion of ”Game of Thrones”, 300, and Kill Bill, Eggers (The Lighthouse) and co-writer Sjorn serve up a ‘ye old tale’ of nipple sweat and literal head-bashing that follows a young Viking’s (Alexander Skarsgard, looking ever the spokesperson for Gold’s Gym) pursuit of the hardhearted killer (Claes Bang) that took the breath from his father (Ethan Hawke) and stole his momma (Nicole Kidman). When Prince Amleth catches up with the treacherous ‘uncle’, the bad dude has lost his throne and is now ruling a smaller village. The determined terminator plays the part of a slave as long as he can – before the shadow of the moon, a witch, and his fondness for fellow hand, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) suggest the time is ripe to make his move. One time HBO pin-up Alexander Skarsgard (“True Blood”), and his workout regime, rule the roost here but Nicole Kidman is equally impressive (the likes of which she hadn’t been in quite a while, in my opinion) as the title character’s ‘complex’ momma. Hawke and Willem Dafoe, in extended cameos, also add to the tasty meat at the core of this beast’s bones. Much of the praise though belongs to the production team – skilled, imaginative visionary Eggers, the stupendous production design of, and cinematographer, who skillfully and flaringly capture the beauty and blood of a nightmarish past. It won’t be for all, particularly those with a weak stomach, but it deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as it can. Another fine notch in the ‘2022 movies’ belt."
"Apr 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Both beautiful and brutal, The Northman is a saga worth seeing."
"Apr 29, 2022",POSITIVE," Vengeance is an easy desire to rationalize. The injustice of suffering leaves a void that the heart naturally wants to fill. The cost of delivering such retribution often plays second fiddle to the mind’s manifestation of the sweet delight seemingly offered by correcting an egregious wrong. Of course, the world is not a binary of good vs. evil, not that vengeance has to care about such realities. The Northman follows a life of vengeance. An adaptation of the legend of Amleth, a Scandinavian figure more familiar to Western audiences for inspiring Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the narrative follows the prince (Alexander Skarsgård, with Oscar Vovak playing Amleth as a young boy) as he seeks to avenge the death of his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also burned his village and abducted his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Prophecy shapes Amleth’s quest, believing himself to be put on the soil solely to take his uncle’s life. Amleth gives up a promising career as a Viking berserker to stow away aboard a slave ship headed to Iceland, the seat of his uncle’s exile. Becoming enslaved himself in the process, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress and kindred spirit. As Amleth and Olga grow closer, the prince faces a fork in the road, the cost of his quest for vengeance contrasted by the prospects of breaking the cycle, to forge a new path free of the endless violence. Director Robert Eggers delivers a slow-burn that’s singularly focused in its step-by-step depiction of Amleth’s submission to prophecy. Just as good and evil exist outside a binary, the question of nature vs. nurture is a bit irrelevant when faced with a reality where the two work in almost-complete tandem. Violence may not be the only life that Amleth could choose to live, but it is the only life he knows how to live. Eggers’ every motion hammers that point home. The cast all seem to understand their place less as characters, but as part of the legend. Eggers seems to understand the weight of epic, the performances and cinematography carrying a soft touch even amidst the narrative’s extreme brutality. Skarsgård never once puffs his chest to assert his place as the hero, in complete alignment with Amleth’s sense of prophecy bestowed upon him at an early age. His approach to character development feels almost more like character actualization than any real sense of growth. Not all boys change as they grow into men. The supporting cast, also including Willem Dafoe and Björk in bit roles, have quite a lot of fun with the material. The 137-minute runtime is a bit over-bloated, but Eggers never loses his grip on his audience through the cerebral narrative. Larger-than-life material is rarely delivered with such serene execution. Epics are not necessarily meant to feel intimate, yet The Northman carries itself like performers in a black box theatre, welcoming even against a backdrop of endless miles of nothingness. The Northman demonstrates Eggers’ immense maturity as a filmmaker, a testament to cinema’s power to communicate rich art to a wide audience. In a world full of crowd-pleaser films fighting for their share of the box office, the film instead aims to leave its viewers with a calmer sense of satisfaction by the time the credits roll. It feels good to be challenged in the theatre, to see an epic wrestle with morals humanity has been grappling with for hundreds of years. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary!

"Apr 29, 2022",POSITIVE," I'll be honest, it didn't take much to sell me on ""The Northman."" The stunning look of it, the particular period setting, the epic scale, its gritty edge -- all of those things are right up my alley. And then there's the film's director, Robert Eggers. I loved his 2015 debut feature ""The Witch."" And while I was pretty lukewarm on his 2019 follow-up ""The Lighthouse,"" it was still an audacious bit of maverick filmmaking. Both of those movies bear many of the same marks of their creator. They're both rooted in Eggers' interests in folk horror and legend. Both show off a near obsessive level of period detail. Both are clearly made by someone fully embracing their creative freedoms. And both feel completely original and unlike anything else that may fall close to their ""genres."" ""The Northman"" is what you get when those very distinct creative signatures are used to tell a bigger story with a bigger cast and with a much bigger studio budget (in this case nearly $90 million). Penned by Eggers and Icelandic screenwriter, poet and novelist Sjon, ""The Northman"" is a brutal and at times bonkers Viking revenge epic based on the same Scandinavian legend that inspired Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" Set in the North Atlantic at the turn of the 10th century, Eggers sits us down in a brawny and violent world, caked in mud and stained with blood. It's a world where human savagery is more commonplace than anything resembling compassion. And where the supernatural and occult co-exist, allowing the director to veer down some dark and twisted paths. More specifically based on the legend of Amleth, ""The Northman"" opens up with a table-setting prologue that sets this revenge-soaked tale in motion. In it, 10-year-old Prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak) enthusiastically greets his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) who is returning home from battle. Wounded and weary, Aurvandil decides it's time to begin preparing his son to take his throne. With the help of the wild-eyed shaman Heimir (Willem Dafoe), Aurvandil leads his son through a gonzo ritualistic rite of passage involving blood oaths, trippy visions and flatulence (it's the first of several scenes sure to test mainstream audiences). The next morning, after a night of unconventional bonding, the course of Amleth's life is changed after he witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) butcher his father and kidnap his now widowed mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). With Fjolnir's bloodcurdling command ""Bring me the boy's head!"" still echoing through the thick air, Amlith flees by boat repeating to himself a mantra that will burn into his soul and fuel his hate for the rest of the film, ""I will avenge you father. I will save you mother. I will kill you Fjolnir."" The screen fades to black and many years pass. When the image returns we see a much older Amleth (played by a hulking Alexander Skarsgard), now a member of a barbaric Viking clan who ravage the Land of the Rus like a pack of ravenous wolves. Here we get one of the film's more spectacular moments -- an incredible single uninterrupted take of the berserkers raiding, pillaging and slaughtering a Slavic village. The intensely difficult and complex sequence sees Eggers and his go-to DP Jarin Blaschke weaving their camera through the chaos and carnage, sucking us into the sheer savagery of the scene. It's gruesome and unflinching. It's also incredible filmmaking. Upon getting word that Fjolnir has now settled in Iceland with Gudrun as his captive wife, Amleth stows away on a boat posing as a slave. There he meets a fellow captive who introduces herself as ""Olga of the Birch Forest"" (Anya Taylor-Joy). She claims to be a sorceress and the two form an immediate bond. ""Your strength breaks men's bones,"" she utters, hinting at an inevitable partnership. ""I have the cunning to break their minds."" The two arrive at Fjolnir's settlement and are immediately put to work. But rather than killing Fjolnir and his men like a rabid beast, Amleth begins a methodical campaign of physical and psychological terror, brutally picking off his prey one-by-one in the dark of night and sending waves of fear throughout the commune. While Eggers is clearly the architect and his fingerprints are everywhere, the movie succeeds thanks to a fine collective effort. Blaschke's camera not only captures the ferocity of the action, but also the beautiful yet harsh textures of the Icelandic landscape. There's also the amazing period richness of Craig Lathrop's production design and Linda Muir's costumes. Add to it the pulse-pounding propulsion of Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough's score. Of course you also have the cast ably led by Skarsgard. He's an imposing mix of cold primal rage and quiet intensity. And though aptly (and somewhat comically) described as a ""Beast cloaked in man-flesh,"" Skarsgard also reveals Amleth's pain and vulnerability. Kidman is a blast, Hawke is as wily as ever, and Bang is pure villain material. Amid the showers of blood, the grime-covered abs and hallucinatory mindtrips lies a fairly basic story. Sure, it features a screaming Valkyrja (Ineta Sliuzaite), a creepy soothsaying seeress (Bjork), and crows working at the behest of Odin himself. Yet the story remains simple. It's the creative juices of Robert Eggers that gives ""The Northman"" its unique identity, from the impeccable detail and design to the wild flourishes and overindulgences. Now where will such a movie land with audiences? That's the $90 million question.

"Apr 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,What you’ll get is neither the bold weirdness of Eggers’s previous efforts in the critically-acclaimed margins nor a clean strike into the blockbuster mainstream.
"Apr 28, 2022",POSITIVE," I recently rewatched Robert Eggers' debut film, “The Witch,” and it’s legitimately impressive this guy gets to keep making the movies he wants to make. A supernatural folk tale set in 1630s New England with period-accurate dialogue didn’t scream “breakout hit,” but thanks to the director’s firm vision and a lead performance by a young Anya Taylor-Joy, he was given a long leash for future projects. He followed that up with “The Lighthouse,” another period film that explored loneliness and isolation with deeply committed performances from Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe. It was a critical favorite but not exactly accessible to wide audiences. (Fun fact from the press junket for Eggers’ latest, “The Northman”: Taylor-Joy revealed she volunteered to play a mermaid in the film. Eggers wisely told her she didn’t want to play that mermaid.) But Eggers is also commanding a bigger budget than he’s ever had (reportedly around $60 million), so he’s also made one of his more accessible movies. One concession he made was having characters in his Viking epic speak English instead of the original Norse. We meet the titular character as young Prince Amleth, who witnesses the murder of his father (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle (Claes Bang) who then takes Amleth’s mother (Nicole Kidman) as his bride. Young Amleth’s memorable refrain from the trailer is a pretty good plot summary: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Skip ahead a couple of decades. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has spent this time getting ripped and plotting his vengeance. His path back to Fjölnir has him joining forces with Olga of the Birch Forest (Taylor-Joy), who’s been taken as a slave and spoil of war. Eggers’ biggest movie to date, “The Northman” truly feels big. Big sets, big battle sequences and big themes. Eggers shows he’s ready for the jump to a bigger budget. Speaking of Icelandic icons, Eggers co-wrote the script with writer Sjón, Icelandic poet, novelist and lyricist who recently penned “Lamb,” as well as Björk’s foray into the world of Lars von Trier, “Dancer in the Dark.” While primarily a character study for Skarsgård’s Amleth and his journey for vengeance, the script goes big, as well, paying a reverent debt to Nordic mythology with a plot that’s complex but mostly clearly defined. Eggers continues to showcase a mastery for exploring this kind of folklore in another authentic period piece. I’d be curious to see what his style would be like on a more modern story, but “The Northman” nevertheless marks him as a director with an exceptional vision."
"Apr 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,&quot;The Northman&quot; is a sweeping epic driven by blood and brutality&#44; offering up a bleak and unrelenting take on the legend that inspired it&#46; It might be great - hell&#44; it almost certainly IS great - but sadly&#44; it left me behind&#46;
"Apr 28, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman, a bodaciously gory new Viking revenge odyssey from director Robert Eggers, charges early into an elaborate long take of carnage and chaos, the kind where the camera just keeps running as all hell breaks loose. Our eponymous anti-hero, a ripped, blood-streaked Nordic he-man played by Alexander Skarsgård, wanders a conquered village, admiring the spoils of his invasion. The air is thick with smoke and screams, and little moments of death and suffering keep passing in the background of the frame, filling every corner of this showboat panorama with grisly detail. We’re witnessing a nightmare from the annals: The horrors of 10th-century pillaging rendered pungently vivid. Yet the way Eggers stages the sequence as an unbroken survey, à la similarly muscular cut-free set-pieces in films like The Revenant and Atonement and 1917, betrays more gleeful fascination — more childlike wonder, even — than disgust. It’s hellish history as a badass ride. This writer couldn’t help but think of Lisa Simpson, daydreaming about a virtual tour led by Genghis Khan. It’s no great insult to suggest that The Northman, for all its impeccable craft and diligent verisimilitude, possesses an intrinsically adolescent appeal. This is teenager cinema par excellence, an opera of old-world mayhem fit for Beavis and Butthead. Eggers is drawing on The Icelandic Sagas, milestones of ancient Scandinavian storytelling, but in doing so, he’s also evoking a whole library of violent pulp entertainment distantly indebted to them: Comic books of barbarian combat, baroque fantasy novels of magic and murder, hack and slash dark-age video games. Certainly, few filmmakers have ever come closer to approximating the horns-up sensibility of heavy metal; were someone to adapt both the album art and lyrics of Swedish Viking-metal titans Amon Amarth for the screen, the results would surely resemble Eggers’ epic. The actual source of inspiration is an iconic legend, shaped into movie form with help from the Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón (an occasional creative collaborator to Björk, who makes a memorable cameo here). A doomy prologue introduces Amleth, the boy destined to be hardened into a wrathful man with a “heart of cold iron.” His formative trauma is the murder of his magnificently bearded father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke, in mortal combat with a tricky accent), ruler of the fictional island of Hrafnsey in AD 895. The culprit: Aurvandill’s brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang of The Square), thirsty for both the crown and the boy’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Narrowly escaping his usurping uncle by boat, little Amleth grows into a strapping warrior prince, devoid of mercy or any motivation deeper than a dully throbbing desire for vengeance. His ancient grudge is reignited when he receives word of Fjölnir’s own pilgrimage, of how he lost his stolen kingdom and was driven to a stretch of hopeless Icelandic soil. There, the traitor has started a new life, and a new family, with the former queen — one of a few discoveries Skarsgård’s Viking marauder makes upon arriving at the far-flung farm in chains, having deliberately fallen into the clutches of slavers to get close to his mark. If this bare-bones plot seems to recall the thrust of Hamlet, that’s no coincidence: The story of Amleth is considered a likely template for the Bard’s revered tragedy. Eggers’ previous movies, The Witch and The Lighthouse, were claustrophobically small affairs — ominous New England folktales that stranded tiny casts within isolated single settings, abandoning them to paranoia, unholy terrors of the mind and body, and ravenous birds. (Danger comes feathered in all of his films.) Perhaps the cabin fever that haunted these characters got to their creator, too. In the scope of timeline, geography, and budget, The Northman represents a frost-giant-sized step forward for Eggers. Somehow, he has secured $90 million to go hunting once more for dread in the pages of history. Will the man only rest once he’s explored every godforsaken, bygone era of cruelty and superstition? The Northman revels in all the filthy spectacle money can buy; every unlikely dollar invested has been splurged on creaky ships approaching ashen shores, collisions of beast-like men, and archaic domiciles engulfed in mighty flames. But Eggers hasn’t abandoned the pet obsessions of his indie work. Again, he’s immersed himself in period research, going nitty-gritty on the look, dress, customs, and vernacular of the terrifying past. Those who enjoyed Willem Dafoe’s crassly eloquent seadog monologues in The Lighthouse will find more purple speechifying where that came from — some of it courtesy, in fact, of a brief court-jester supporting performance by the same game actor. And once more, the grubby environmental realism is offset with glowing supernatural visions, including a literal family tree (the fruit it bears is a lineage of kings), dreams of valkyries battle-crying en route to skyward Valhalla, and an undead swordsman who marks The Northman as a kindred spirit in artisanal mythmaking to last summer’s The Green Knight. A less expected comparison the director might refute: The portentously macho big-canvas action of Zack Snyder. Jason Momoa’s fanbase of fisherfolk serenaders would fit in well here, and it’s easy to imagine Skarsgård among the 300 of 300. The movie’s a feast for the eyes, no doubt — an IMAX-worthy Grand Guignol opus bathed in shades of inferno orange, moonlight blue, and intestinal red. It’s less satisfying as drama, revenge-, psycho-, or otherwise. Skarsgård looks great drenched in all manner of viscera, but he’s playing a man so hollowed out by a lifetime of Viking bloodlust that he’s become as rigid as an action figure. A little of the soulful sorrow Russell Crowe brought to the like-minded Gladiator would have helped, especially in regards to a malnourished romantic subplot featuring a fellow steely slave played by Eggers’ Witch star Anya Taylor-Joy. Then again, Amleth’s unwavering, consuming brutishness might be the closest The Northman has to a point beyond shock and awe. Just as The Lighthouse poked deranged fun at anxious masculinity, Eggers’ apocalyptic latest finds folly in a legacy of machismo, passed down from father to son for generations. It’s an idea best expressed through the surprises nestled into later stretches of the plot, including one big subversion of the straightforward righteousness of our hero’s journey. (Shrewdly, this turn rests on a dynamite scene with Kidman, who seems faintly wasted in a thankless role right up until the moment that she sends the film careening off in a darkly, juicily perverse new direction.) What Eggers has made, with much intelligence, improbably bottomless resources, and an almost touchingly geeky obsession with historical accuracy (marvel at the detours into funeral rites and manhood trials and musical festivities), is a single-minded pageant of excess. The unyielding brutality is the movie’s limitation — it knows only how to bludgeon, however artfully — but also what will endear it to pubescent hellraisers of all ages. That, and a proudly juvenile sense of humor that pokes through the poker-faced savagery from time to time, provides another link of plain authorship to Eggers’ last movie. If there’s anything the proverbial 12-year-old moviegoer loves more than severed heads and zombie knights, it’s a good fart joke. The sci-fi genre owes much of its evolution to a myriad of television series that have shaped and redefined it over the years. These influential shows underscore the power of the small screen to captivate audiences, particularly through sci-fi's distinct combination of innovative storytelling and ambitious visuals. Whether viewers are fans of futuristic technology, extraterrestrial encounters, or dystopian futures, there's something for every kind of sci-fi lover among the genre's best entries. April was a bit of a low-key month for movies, but there was still plenty of pleasure to be had at the theater. Indies were well-represented with the surreal sci-fi movie The Beast while multiplexes enjoyed the social commentary and IMAX action set pieces of Alex Garland's appropriately divisive Civil War. Ousted from Champions League action over the week, Manchester City turn their focus to a different trophy today when they take on Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinals at Wembley Stadium. City are unbeaten in their last eight matches against the Blues across all competition, but Chelsea have played the Premier League leaders tough this season, setting this one up as a potential thriller.

"Apr 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers take a predictable revenge tale and makes it his own, especially early on. Definitely a slow-burn that builds effectively with assured, confident direction that also asks for patience. Visually, it's one of the best of the year. "
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," In a number of ways, most especially in terms of budget, The Northman is Robert Eggers’ most ambitious film so far. And in the sets, the sprawling locations, the visual effects and the deep bench of notable actors, that financial ambition is up there on the screen. Yet there remains the impression that all of that money has had a tempering influence. The Northman might have some fantastically evocative character names (Fjölnir the Brotherless, King Aurvandil War-Raven, Olga of the Birch Forest) but it never gives itself over to the otherworldly lunacy lurking within in the way The Lighthouse did. It flirts with madness but remains in the mainstream. Of course, that’s only in relation to Egger’s earlier work. By comparison to other megaplex fare, The Northman has unnerving, bad trip psychedelia to spare. Bodies float in smoky chambers and the voices of eyeless seers reverberate in our very skulls. Men like Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) pursue their worldly aims—like avenging the murder of his father (Ethan Hawke) and the kidnapping of his mother (Nicole Kidman) at the hands of his uncle (Claes Bang)—but they do so at the whim of gods and demons. Yet Eggers, as usual, grounds the supernatural in the empirical. The Northman may be full of dark mysticism but it’s irrevocably entwined with Amleth’s world of mud, blood and iron. There’s a reason that blind oracle (Björk) calls what she does her “earth magic.” The Lighthouse was told in vivid black and white and The Northman is in color. But’s not a 180 degree turn for Eggers. This is a world of gray skies and muted, worn garments but Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography does not belong to the dark-therefore-serious school of 21st century aesthetics. Color is used sparingly but gorgeously, as when rivers of lava begin to open viscous, orange wounds in the terra. There’s a pushback, in certain spheres of cinephilia, against movies that are cool as fuck for the sake of being cool as fuck. This is a wrongheaded form of classicism that seeks to exclude from the discourse the very type of filmmaking that will likely, in the future, be seen as representative of this era’s taste. The Northman is certainly “badass” (or maybe just super metal, once you take the thrillingly percussive score into account) in a way that may seem superficial but that says more about the aesthetic values of the present day than most of the bland and visually undeveloped stuff that tops the box office. And yet there is a nagging blandness, an expectedness, at the core of The Northman. Perhaps it’s simply that the formula of the revenge movie is too hard to shake. Even though Eggers tries to interrogate the subgenre–using his knack for creating versions of our world that are still somehow alien to question whether, by the rules of this society, the man who so wronged Amleth and his family may actually be more just–the film becomes less interesting the more it succumbs to the necessities of its plot. It’s better than most of the current movies in its weight class but it’s less than that of which we know Eggers is capable."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I would say it's one of my favorite movies of the year, but it's really one of my favorite experiences of the year."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is grounded in a manically precise capture of the Nordic world of the 9th century AD, but refracted through the lens of a whacked-out visionary in a spew of eye-popping images. After the revelation of The Lighthouse in 2019, I would have rushed to see any film by indie auteur Robert Eggers. Lighthouse is a bleakly hilarious account of two “wickies” manning a remote lighthouse (Willem Dafoe, Robert Pattinson in career-bests) who engage in a toxic power struggle that spirals into mutual self-destruction. As the teaser for my review of the film had it, “Nothing good happens when two men are left alone in a giant phallus.” With its brew of the historical, the mythical, and the paranoid, Lighthouse distilled a kind of madness I needed more of. Now Eggers has come crashing back on the scene with The Northman, a rude, bloody, hyper-violent Viking saga like nothing you’ve ever seen. It’s remarkable that Eggers not only conceived a film that posed such daunting challenges, but had the guts to see it to completion through the pandemic and clashes with the production company about creative control. (And speaking of guts, I’m afraid they make a dramatic appearance worthy of a mention in the credits). Northman is grounded in a manically precise capture of the Nordic world of the 9th century AD, but refracted through the lens of a whacked-out visionary in a spew of eye-popping images. Set in Iceland in 895 AD, Northman revisits a quest for revenge, a tale as ancient as they come. An opening image of a volcano belching ash and fire sounds a thrilling note of foreboding. Young Prince Amleth rejoices as he and his mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) welcome back from the wars King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). The festivities include a nutty Viking-style bar mitzvah, as Amleth is initiated into warrior-hood by his father and court jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe). The trio tap into their inner beast, complete with ferocious growls and flatulence — no pickled herring here — and ingest a substance that accesses the spirits of heroic predecessors. As the king predicts his own impending death, Amleth vows he’ll avenge him. In one of Eggers’ many insane images, a pantheon of warriors descend as desiccated replicas hanging off a tree like Christmas ornaments — a detail that Eggers likely unearthed in Icelandic art. Credit his regular cinematographer Jarin Blaschke for translating these eerie findings to the screen. In short order Amleth’s uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang, The Square) murders the king and kidnaps the queen. The boy evades his pursuers and sets out to sea in a rowboat. Cut to two decades later, and Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård.) is now a towering Viking hulk sporting a wolf’s head chapeau and powered by a single unwavering mission: kill his uncle, save his mother, avenge his father. If the set-up feels familiar, it’s because Shakespeare drew on the same ancient legend about Prince Amleth for Hamlet. Though Eggers’s ferocious Amleth could hardly be more different from the waffling Danish prince; nor would he have attended the university of Wittenberg unless they were diversifying by admitting wolf-men. Amleth has signed on with a band of Viking beserkers who raid neighboring villages. (“Beserker,” I learned, is a noun, maybe even a trade.) From a seer he learns that Fjolnir has been dethroned and fled with Gudrun and his sons to Iceland. The seer is none other than Bjork, witchy as hell in blue lighting, and sporting a head dress of dangling cowrie shells as the ur hippie. After stowing away in a boat full of war prisoners, Amleth arrives on Fjolnir’s farm a slave, and poses as a loyal servant. En route he hooks up with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) who’s on direct dial to the spirit world. In the third act Gudrun confronts her son with explosive details that reframe the story, but Amleth remains undeterred from his mission. At the center of all the mayhem is Skarsgård as Amleth. The actor’s bulked-up ursine posture, washboard abs, and bulging traps convey a Viking man-beast risen up from centuries past. It’s rare to see an actor project so powerfully with steely eyes and ripped physique — but language is beside the point: “my heart knows only revenge,” Amleth repeats. Sidebar: to build those massive traps, Skarsgård. ate 3,700 calories a day and trained in the gym to capture Amleth’s “spiritual animals,” a bear and a wolf. Says his trainer Magnus Lydgback, “one look at him and you get scared.” If I saw this correctly, Amleth rips out an enemy’s throat with his teeth; he also wins a Viking version of cricket, in which rocks meet skulls, and the victor is the man who still has his head on. Ancillary characters appear to be missing a nose, or peering with the whites of their eyes into the plans of the “norns” (the Viking weavers of fate). A couple of discerning women friends have told me they’d just as soon give Northman a pass. So is this a film mainly for the bros? In fact, the female characters hold their own amidst the brutal exploits through cunning and visionary prowess. Kidman (always superb) delivers a barn-burner of a scene when she recognizes Amleth as her son. If Anya Taylor-Joy didn’t exist, Eggers would have to invent her. With her freaky wide-set eyes and beauty that belong to some otherworldly creature, she’s the ideal match for his sensibility. That said, yes, Northman does celebrate Nordic testosterone, casting the viewer back to a ruder moment when male brawn ruled land and sea. But the theme of unwavering obsession should resonate with any viewer. Eggers has made himself a scholar of Viking lore and artifacts. The wooden boats plying the North Atlantic in a snowstorm, the head gear of toothy wolves, the rough-hewn, fire-lit Viking dwellings, accurate down to the last wooden peg, the mire and blood — all feel authentic as hell. For sheer beauty, add the craggy vistas of Iceland — and Ireland, where Northman was partly filmed. Yet Egger’s fetish for exactitude never cramps his cinematic fluency. He’s partial to long takes that deliver a you-are-there immediacy. A spectacular sequence of the beserkers scaling a tall fence to lay waste to a village are shot in a single take with an on-rushing momentum. The standard approach would chop the sequence into several takes. Eggers pulls you into real time. Equally remarkable is that Northman, the third work of an art house auteur, was bankrolled by a major studio for a purported seventy mil — numbers that are almost always attached to some numbing blockbuster based on a comic book action hero franchise. We got lucky. The guys who greenlit Northman clearly succumbed to the nuttiness and the magic. I mean, think of it, two all but naked men dueling to the death on the fiery lip of a volcano at the Gates of Hell! Where will Robert Eggers take us next? Erica Abeel is a novelist, film and cultural critic, and former professor at CUNY. Her 2016 novel Wild Girls, about three women rebels of the ’50s, was an Oprah Magazine pick. Her journalism has appeared in the New York Times, Indiewire, and other major sites and national publications. A former dancer, when not writing she’s in a Pilates class or at the barre. Her new novel, The Commune, was recently published by Adelaide Books. I look forward to reading Abeel reviews as much or more for her incredible ability and talent with
language, descriptions, sentence constructions, words, which are magical, imaginative, indescribable,
as I do for the actual movie review.  After reading this review i would both rush to see this movie,
and have lunch or dinner with Abeel to hope she is as entertaining as dinner partner, as she is
as movie critic.  Long live this Director, the hulky Greek God like Star, the movie, and most of all
Ms Abeel’s superb word skills. Very dark, satanic and evil. Story line is weak and long and at one point boring.  I’ve  seen many movies re: The Viking men from the north. This one is the worse.  Trust me don’t waste your money on this movie."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," Hell hath no fury like a Nordic prince wronged. That’s the premise of this 10th century Scandinavian revenge allegory. Deceit, murder and vengeance rain down in torrents.  King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke, Training Day) has just returned from war to his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, Being the Ricardos) and tween son Amleth (Oscar Novak). As the father prepares his son the prince to transition into adulthood, the king’s sibling Fjölnir The Brotherless (Claes Bang, The Square) comes home too. In short order, the jealous Fjölnir kills Aurvandil, steals his wife and tries to murder the son, who escapes.  This ultra-cruel parable is of biblical proportions. Hard not to want to see Amleth complete his mission. Tough to watch a young man waste his life filled with so much hate. Yet that is the fuel he and the narrative burns. In-between heads getting chopped off (an over-used device), men being speared, women abused and enough debauchery to shame Game of Thrones, some viewers may wonder who the hell directed this. There is nothing cheesy, generic, B-movie or lackluster in the entire production, from a technical or artistic standpoint. How did a Viking story become a work of art? Director Eggers evidenced his exquisite style in the gorgeous, haunting B&W film The Lighthouse. So, no wonder his take on an historic medieval ode is an amazing spectacle. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke’s fluid camerawork captures battle scenes, assassinations, brawls, lovemaking and sea voyages in perfectly composed shots with impeccable lighting. Craig Lathrop’s production design, Robert Cowper’s art direction and Pancho Chamorro’s set decoration recreate the period and places as if they’d lived through the times. Dark chambers, dingy colors, worn furniture and tarnished jewelry.  Costume designer Linda Muir should applaud herself for making the clothes look filthy dirty. The score (Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough), with loud pounding drums, crescendos at the right times and the only musical hiccups are two eccentric Björk performances. For 2h and 16m, scenes are cut with exacting precision (editor Louise Ford). Lots of Egger’s tech crew worked on The Lighthouse, and he should keep them in his employ indefinitely—even if he has to give them pension plans to do so.  Egger forgoes a completely literal adaptation, and instead adds supernatural images of mythology, sorcery and witchery. Bodies float in air, a mysterious seeress foretells the future and wild dogs howl in unison. Yet you never question this extra dimension, even with its Native American-like overtones, because it elevates the storytelling. This ethereal, spiritual realm counteracts the dark realistic savagery on earth. Violence is power. Instincts are primal. The language is gruff. All that comes across in the battles, interactions, threats, perils and animalistic behavior. Through it all, Egger pulls excellent performances from his cast, maintains a steady forceful tone and drives the storylines to a cataclysmic ending. Try as you may, you can’t take your eyes off the screen."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"If anyone is victorious, it's the viewer of this immersive saga, who will emerge wobbly-legged, dazed and probably a little more appreciative of the relative tameness of modern life."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Pure cinematic bliss. Great performances, a blood-soaked revenge story and Karin Blaschke' gorgeous shots - all amazing. Full review in Spanish"
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," If you enjoy the brisk swoosh of a sword carving fabric and flesh, or that thunk! thunk! sound of an axe chopping into someone’s torso, then get ready for The Northman. Those who prefer movies with witty dialogue and psychological complexity may have to look elsewhere. Robert Eggers’s medieval saga has been hailed as the most “authentic” drama ever made about the world of the Vikings. If this is true, it makes one doubly thankful not to have been born in an age when life or liberty could be extinguished by a sudden visit from a group of Scandinavian marauders whose business model was wholesale plunder and massacre. As we seem to be returning to an age of mass aggression and superstition, it’s only to be expected that stories about the Vikings, along with other ‘sword & sorcery’ tales will grow in popularity. The History Channel’s Vikings, which might be seen as a violent, historical soap opera, has run through six seasons, and Netflix has just launched a sequel series. Perhaps it will help revive a flagging share price. Eggers keeps things a lot simpler in The Northman, which stays within the boundaries of a medieval mentality. That means a view of the world that extends no further than the distance one could travel in a longboat. The Vikings made pretty good distance, but they went everywhere with hostile intentions. What seems barbaric and cruel to us was standard practice for them. To die in combat was a glorious fast-track to Valhalla, to seek revenge for injuries and insults was a sacred obligation. It was a world in which the presence of the Gods, spirits, witches and other supernatural beings was taken for granted. The Gods, forever hungry for blood, had to be appeased with rituals and sacrifices. All these elements are present in The Northman, which begins in the year 895, with King Aurandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), returning to his kingdom on the Irish coast, after a successful raiding expedition. The King, who has been wounded and is feeling his mortality, decides to initiate his 13-year-old son, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) into the ways of manhood and kingship. This he achieves with a lot of animalistic role-playing, orchestrated by court jester and part-time sorcerer, Heimir (Willem Dafoe). Shortly afterwards, Amleth watches in horror as his father is murdered by his own brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who seizes both power and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth escapes by boat. When we meet him again, he is a musclebound berserker who has grown up in the land of the Rus. He joins enthusiastically in the warriors’ extravagant male-bonding rituals, whereby men become wolves. After a raid, executed with maximum violence and cruelty, Amleth meets a sorceress (Björk), who reveals his destiny, which is focused on a single-minded desire to exact revenge on his uncle. To do so, he has to join a party of slaves being sent to Iceland, where Fjölnir now has his estates. On the boat he meets another semi-sorceress, Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who will play a big part in the unfolding story. Amleth endures the life of a slave as he assembles the necessary components of his revenge campaign. Naturally, he needs the right, supernatural sword for the job, and has to wrest it from a ghostly warrior by the light of the silvery moon. Each step he takes is dictated by inexorable fate, building to a predictably brutal climax. As you can see by now, there’s no mystery about where this story is heading. The strength of The Northman lies in its evocation of place and time. The spectacular scenery of Iceland, where the last chapters of the story play out, is no less impressive than the blow-by-blow portrayal of the Viking raid in which Amleth plays such a starring role, lumbering around the village like an automaton, casually dispensing death and revelling in the carnage. To prepare for this role, Alexander Skarsgård has bulked up to superhero proportions. A mass of muscle with a weapon in each hand, he’s a terrifying prospect. By contrast, Anya Taylor-Joy, with her strange but sexy looks, doesn’t have to change a thing to pass as a sorceress. Nicole Kidman gets to play the bad mother, while Claes Bang must have enjoyed escaping all those artworld roles and putting on the medieval togs. The film features a complete smörgåsbord of accents, with actors adding Irish or Scandinavian inflections as the mood takes them. The babble does little to detract from a film that relies so heavily on the visuals. For Eggers, who achieved cult status for his first two features, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), this movie is a big step forward. I thought both of those earlier movies were little more than sketches with Gothic trimmings. Eggers was a designer before he became a director, and his passion for detail means the look of his films seems to take precedence over the substance. The superiority of The Northman must owe a big debt to Eggers’s co-writer, the Icelandic poet and novelist, Sjón, a longterm friend and collaborator of Björk’s. You may recall last year’s low-key Icelandic horror movie, Lamb, for which Sjón wrote the story. In all his works, (try the novella, The Blue Fox), there is a fascination with the history and mythogy of Scandinavia, a preoccupation with nature mysticism and the supernatural. Sjón has left a heavy imprint on this attempt to make a contemporary cinematic version of a Norse saga. If there are distant echoes of Hamlet it may be because Shakespeare took the plot of his famous play from a Danish saga of c.1200. The name “Amleth” , which allegedly means “insane” in Old Norse, is a giveaway. There are also echoes of Greek mythology, in the character of Orestes, driven mad by his need to avenge the murdered of his father, Agamemnon. In the manner of Aeschylus’s Oresteia, there is a tragic inevitability about The Northman. Amleth’s fate is decided by the Gods, and he is compelled to go where it takes him if he is to achieve his one burning objective. All the mechanics of the plot are mapped out in his encounters with male and female sorcerers. At one point Amleth begins to believe he can choose whether to follow that path or not, but we know that in tales like this, true choice does not exist. Once again, this is a reflection of the mindset of the middle ages, when life was precarious and predetermined by the circumstances of one’s birth. Brute force was one way of getting ahead, sorcery was another. The Gods laughed at our ancestors’ efforts to seize control of their own fate, and they are still laughing today."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Robert Eggers has a unique conception for the film, and he's guided his actors and technical team to bring it to the screen with extreme vividness."
"Apr 27, 2022",POSITIVE," These muttered, repeated words by Viking prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak as a young boy, and a hulking, angry Alexander Skarsgård as an adult) are essentially summarising Robert Eggers‘ narrative intentions in The Northman, an ugly, brutal, at-times Shakespearean drama. Witnessing the death of his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), at the hand of his uncle, Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang), Amleth’s aforementioned tripartite vow consumes his mentality as he flees his island village and vows revenge. Revenge and violence has clearly been all the damaged Amleth has raised himself on, so much so that he’s momentarily lost his way and indulged in a wolf-pack of fellow-minded ferals who pillage villages throughout Europe.  This life of murder (and, evidently by Skarsgård’s shredded frame, consistent crossfit) means he’s in need of a realignment, and thanks to an otherwordly Seeress (Björk, the Icelandic singer returning to feature films after 2000’s controversial Dancer in the Dark), he’s reminded of his vow and sets a course to save his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Given Eggers is such an unconventional storyteller, it makes sense that The Northman indulges in a fever-dream temperament over the course of its 137 minute running time.  Though it’s arguably his most accessible title compared to The Witch and The Lighthouse, Eggers still injects a sense of fantasy and outer-realm placement to assure his enthusiasts that his sense of accessibility doesn’t necessarily equate to mainstream normality. It’s his most straightforward narrative to date, with a void of ambiguity or thematics to ponder over, and his sense of story balance with physical set-pieces working in a lush harmony.  Similarly, Eggers has opted out of entire historical accuracy by allowing his characters to speak in English with vague Scandinavian inflections; Kidman’s first line of dialogue leaning into slight camp territory that her wild performance maintains throughout. As mythic and as violent as it proves to be, The Northman remains quite a human story at its heart though, with Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest, a sorceress who becomes an ally and, later, love interest to Amleth, injecting much needed humanity and kindness into a story dripping with sweat and unpleasantness.  Their bond spurs Amleth on in a manner that forces him to reinterpret the relationships and dynamics he believed he knew, primarily with his mother and his uncle, characters that are painted in much more complicated strokes than initially believed. Utilising his healthiest budget to date, Eggers should be commended on seeing through his interpretation of such a story, with the elements that speak to the masses (revenge, love, redemption) infused with his unique sensibility that may catch general viewers off guard, but will sure tickle those that have come to expect nothing less from a filmmaker unafraid to be bold and gorgeously weird. Film critic with a penchant for Dwayne Johnson, Jason Momoa, Michelle Pfeiffer and horror movies, harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news."
"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," Whether it’s the demonic tenet of living deliciously, the madness of isolation, or the driving lust for vengeance, elemental human forces and primal fury - both knowable and ineffable - are at the center of Robert Eggers’ works. His first two meagerly-budgeted features, the astounding The Witch and the feverishly unhinged The Lighthouse, revel in rich period details and blistering imagery, delivering harrowing tales of ascetic (and supernatural) struggle. Eggers’ latest movie, The Northman, continues to pull the same threads of its predecessors with its magnitudes-larger budget and scope, detonating the director’s filmmaking to a whole new level. Maintaining his meticulous, arresting artistry, Eggers constructs a sweeping tale of laser-focused retribution, woven into the alien tapestry of ancient Nordic myth. Unfurling the Scandinavian legend that begat Shakespeare’s Hamlet, The Northman tells the simple story of a man consumed by revenge. King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his own brother (Claes Bang), and his young prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) watches helplessly as his beloved father’s head is cleft from his body. Usurping the throne and marrying Amleth’s mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Fjölnir - now Fjölnir the Brotherless - dispatches his helmed warriors to finish off the fledgling heir, but the boy escapes via rowboat, vowing revenge and chanting the mantra that will follow him for the rest of his days: “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” In The Northman, the the path of vengeance is long, arduous, and roundabout, but the fires of rage stoke an ever-hot thirst for revenge in Amleth, now a grown man (Alexander Skarsgård).  “You must choose between kindness for your kin, and hatred for your enemies.” With words imparted from an encounter with a He-Witch (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson), The Northman flirts with Amleth’s interiority, teasing an inner conflict pitting bloodlust against introspection, but admirably enough, Eggers’ script - co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón (2021’s Lamb) - rejects such modern sentimentalities: Amleth’s vengeful terminus is fated, even after he falls in love with Olga of the Birch Forest (a sublime Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic sorceress who aids him with his quest. There’s a purity of purpose within the walls of The Northman, where every decision wholly informs an unquenchable desire for retaliation; utilizing his berserker upbringing to hone his body for a singular, bloody purpose, Amleth - steeled with rage and sinew - journeys to exact his revenge upon his traitorous uncle, and everything else is just a distraction. The temptation of a mundane farmer’s life flits about the story’s periphery, especially when a blind seeress (Björk) reveals that Fjölnir himself has been overthrown into a humbled station of exile, but even then the die is already cast for Amleth and the only purpose he has known his entire life. This is not a sword-to-plowshares story.  Robert Eggers’ maniacal attention to period details unspooled transportive, intimately terrifying cinema with both The Witch and The Lighthouse. And now with The Northman, he scales up his deeply-researched visions to newly massive proportions, sprinkling its cold-steel warfare with ethereal imagery that would feel utterly alien if you didn’t know how deftly it was excavated from actual history. An atavistic coming-of-age ritual finds Amleth and his father ululating like animals; a moonlit duel with a draugr zombie wrests a fabled runeblade from its skeletal altar; a glass-eyed valkyrie with carved teeth screeches upon a flying mount; and visions of a vast, cosmically tendriled tree conveys a long bloodline of warrior kings; The Northman plays out like the fables of last year’s The Green Knight with a guided missile attached, combining illusory phantasmagoria with focused and determined bloodshed. If esoteric fever dreams aren’t your jam, you needn’t worry - there’s plenty of straight-laced action to drink in. Eggers, with his DP of choice Jarin Blaschke, cuts a nasty swath of brutality through The Northman: ugly eviscerations, gruesome tableaus, and volcano-top duels are just a few of the film’s visceral pleasures, all captured with sweeping camerawork and precise long takes.  The Northman is full of fiery performances. Alexander Skarsgård is note-perfect as the tunnel-visioned berserker killer, and Nicole Kidman - still queen of the soul-baring monologue - throws the biggest gut punch of the film. Even Claes Bang’s fratricidal Fjölnir is tinged with a surprising sadness: A usurper marked for death with no crown or throne, you almost feel bad for the guy. The most disarming performance, however, belongs to Anya Taylor-Joy, radiating self-possession and remarkable depth with her limited screen time. Filling in the cracks and fissures of humanity in the wake of the era’s sanguine carnage, Taylor-Joy is almost supernaturally adept at throwing weight behind her defiant glances, tender softness, and wounded prayers; despite her fleeting presence, it’s nigh impossible to envision any other young actress in the role. A straight shot of cold-dished vengeance, The Northman delivers brutal melees and a mesmerizing hypnosis through olde mythology. Where Hamlet soliliquies through his pained quest for justice, Amleth suffers no such pretensions: Trudging through dirt, snow, and magma, there is only one destination for his blade, with no recourse and no battle for the soul. The most single-minded revenge flick in recent memory, The Northman speaks volumes about the cost of violence…by barely mentioning it at all. A rain of metal, blood, and ash wrapped in a one way ticket to Valhalla, Eggers - in true Viking fashion - leaves no room for interrogation, only fatalistic exhilaration."
"Apr 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"An incredibly well-made and well-acted film with some spectacular attention to detail, but the slight story and Skarsgard's stoic performance undermines Eggers' technical achievements. "
"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," In the 12th century or thereabouts, a fellow we know today as Saxo Grammaticus sat down to write a history of Denmark, a chronicle of its mythology, history, and conquests. I doubt he knew that his work would inspire generations of adaptations. But, as fate would have it, two of his 16 books told a rollicking tale of Amleth, grandson of a king. Amleth’s father was murdered by his brother, Amleth’s uncle, who then married Amleth’s mother. Amleth feigned madness to escape his uncle’s sword, but eventually, he took his revenge. Historians believe Saxo Grammaticus’s account of Amleth was itself an adaptation, based on older Icelandic poems. But it would be far from the final retelling of the tale. Most famously, a few centuries later, an English playwright used Amleth’s tale as the inspiration for the story of a Danish prince who avenged his own father’s death at the hand of his uncle-cum-stepfather. He titled it The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.  A recent New Yorker profile delves into the meticulous research that Eggers — who was similarly attentive to historical accuracy in his earlier features, The Witch and The Lighthouse — engaged in to make The Northman. It stars an extremely ripped Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth alongside Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Claes Bang, Willem Dafoe, and Björk. Eggers, who co-wrote the film with the Icelandic poet Sjón, had historians of Icelandic and Viking history on speed-dial throughout production. The filmmakers integrated archaeological discoveries and ancient symbology into the film; they recreated the past so carefully that, as the New Yorker put it, this “might be the most accurate Viking movie ever made.” It’s far more intricate than your average layperson, or even your above-average layperson, would probably be able to recognize, even upon a dozen rewatches.  So The Northman’s Amleth has a life quite different from the one in Saxo Grammaticus’s tale. He is a boy prince recently initiated by his father (Hawke) and their witch-priest (Dafoe) into his royal responsibilities, who sees his uncle Fjölnir (Bang) kill his father and carry away his mother, Queen Gudrún (Kidman). He flees the scene, and an adviser tells the new King Fjölnir that Amleth has drowned. Amleth vows to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir, and his vow turns to a kind of mantra as he grows to adulthood. As a man, Amleth is a roving Viking, pillaging and murdering his way across Europe, when he catches wind that Fjölnir and Amleth’s family now live in Iceland, Fjölnir having lost his kingdom. Amleth poses as a slave, joining a group of captured Slavs in order to get close to his hated uncle. Among them is a seer (Taylor-Joy); the two plot to take his revenge, fully aware that his fate, to avenge his father no matter the cost, is always lurking. So in The Northman there is feigning, but not of madness. There are many more twists and turns in Saxo Grammaticus’s account than in the film, including sojourns in England and Scotland and many brushes with death, but there’s no sign of The Northman’s seer. And in the film’s more straightforward telling, fate has other tricks up its sleeve, particularly in the case of Gudrún. The Northman, set in a world where dreams, supernatural forces, and magic are as real as mud and blood, emphasizes within Amleth’s story the Vikings’ deep-seated belief in the inescapability of fate. The core remains familiar, a tale of treachery and bravery and villainy, but this is a new spin on a very old story. Amleth is not a modern man dropped into the Vikings’ world; he doesn’t really think or act like us. There’s no sense here of defending his individual honor. Though he talks of reclaiming what’s been taken from him, it’s his sense of being woven into a broader history, a history that needs straightening out, that drives him. He’s the rightful king, but not of some great nation-state; he stands to gain very little if he regains that position. And the few things that seem to make him happy, like his love, are of very little consequence to him in the face of fate. He’s fascinating, but you don’t really want to emulate him. Braveheart this is not. His choices make little sense to us. They aren’t really supposed to. He isn’t chasing fame or glory or salvation or some kind of patriotic duty, in the manner of the tales of heroism Hollywood movies often tell. His incantation-like drive to avenge, save, and kill turns out to be built on shaky foundations. And in the end, it all feels a little futile. He’s just on the path set out for him by the inexorable will of fate, a force that’s more like gravity than anything we’ve seen.  That means that, among recent films set in medieval eras, The Northman is a lot closer to the weird, spooky, somewhat inexplicable The Green Knight than The Last Duel, which is populated by people who seem like they’re basically us but really regressive and mean. It also makes it a bit more inscrutable and a lot less “satisfying,” if we measure film-watching satisfaction in terms of catharsis. We modern moviegoers want a swell of triumph, even if our hero dies. The marketing team for The Northman seems to know this, spinning up a trailer that makes it feel more like a chilly, wet Gladiator than what it really is: something very weird and gnarly and bombastic and explosive. The poster’s tagline is “Conquer Your Fate,” which is exactly what Amleth doesn’t do. He doesn’t even think he can do it. He is a hero, of a sort, and a tragic one. We’re still telling his story. If you can extract a modern message from The Northman — that “toxic masculinity” has been destroying men for literal eons, that women have been granted limited agency to push back — it’s really not the point of this retelling of Saxo Grammaticus’s already retold tale. Eggers recreated, with obsessive accuracy, the world of the medievals in order to lower us into a myth that feels primordial and strange, as if it’s tapping into something in the back of our minds that we’ve always known but half forgotten. Today we assume we have agency, that we’re the captains of our own ships. But thousands of years ago, the assumption was different. They might have known something we don’t.

"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," Filmmaker Robert Eggers enjoys delving into the past and putting a punctuation mark on his efforts.It was true in “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” and now he performs the same feat with “The Northman.” Simply put, the story centers on a son who sees his father betrayed and murdered by his brother, and his mother taken by the brother. Eggers seems to have done his homework. While the movie is fictional entertainment, Eggers creates a culture that seems real, with religious and traditional precepts that ring authentic. And like “Hamlet” and “Conan,” “The Northman” blends the real world with folklore as well as supernatural and mystical elements in which people rely on talismans and omens to chart their destiny. After fleeing his homeland, Amleth is raised by Vikings. He is a merciless berserker, killing those who fall under his sword. But Amleth never forgets the vow he made when he fled — avenge his father, save his mother and kill his uncle. To achieve his aims, Amleth falls in with a group of slaves being sent to his uncle’s farm in Iceland. It seems his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), lost his usurped kingdom to a more powerful king. Thus, the small, rocky and bleak domain he now rules in the middle of nowhere. Alexander Skarsgård is a driven Amleth, allowing nothing to distract him from his quest; not even the beautiful sorceress, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who aids Amleth. The two fall in love, but even that cannot deter Amleth from fulfilling his vow. “The Northman” may not be your kind of movie. Eggers does not seem to care whether or not the violence offends you. His purpose is to showcase a brutal time when life and death meant less than today. I am a founding member of the Indiana Film Journalists Association.

"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Roger Eggers has a flair for the historical. He does painstaking research into crafting his worlds that reflect such specific moments in history that still speak to contemporary themes. With his third feature The Northman, Eggers continues that trend. But this time, he has a $90 million budget, Viking violence, and blood spurting across the screen. In his previous films, The Witch and The Lighthouse examine the power and destruction of restraint. But with The Northman, it is nonstop chaos with not an ounce of restraint in sight. Here, Eggers and his co-writer Sjón are tapping into the darker, feral part of the human psyche where feelings are worn on sleeves and violence is almost always the answer. From the get-go, The Northman taps into pure id, where men are farting, burping, screaming, and slaughtering with reckless abandon. The film opens in a Scandinavian kingdom ruled by King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). He rules with his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his son Amleth (Oscar Novak). As he returns from war, he takes his son on a spirit quest of sorts. They drink a hallucinogenic concoction, guided by Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe). The duo howl, bark, fart, and burp to prove their own humanity; they are not beasts, but triumphant men fit to rule. Quickly, Amleth’s life is derailed as his uncle and Aurvandil’s bastard brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) decapitates Aurvandil and takes control of the kingdom. Amleth must flee for his life and row away on a tumultuous ocean. This is the birth of his chant, “I will avenge you father, I will save your mother, I will kill you Fjölnir.” Flash forward 20 years and Amleth (Alexandar Skarsgård) is now a grown man who has joined the ranks of the Vikings, pillaging villages and taking slaves. Here, comes one of the film’s most impressive shots, a long take showing Amleth and his comrades absolutely destroying a village. He catches a spear in midair, scales a massive wall, and slices necks and bellies, all while grunting and screaming in nothing but his underwear and a wolf pelt. This shot captures the absolute chaos and violence of the Vikings. There’s no romanticizing of the time period. Instead, Eggers showcases the constant state of fear and war that permeated the landscape. From there, Amleth is visited by a seer (the iconic Björk in her first role since Dancer In The Dark). She tells him how exactly he can achieve his goal of revenge. He learns of Fjölnir’s location in Iceland and quickly leaves the Vikings in pursuit of his ultimate goal. Disguised as a slave, he boards a ship bound for Iceland bringing Fjölnir a group of slaves to help him establish his new kingdom. Here he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and they begin to establish a tentative report to save themselves.  Everything about The Northman is disgustingly beautiful. From the costume design to establishing shots of the lush Icelandic landscapes, DP Jarin Blaschke (who previously worked with Eggers on The Witch and The Lighthouse) has a talent for making this violent subject matter a visual feast. Whether it’s one of the film’s numerous battle sequences or Amleth’s kaleidoscopic fever dreams, Blaschke offers more than just muddy villages and dirty Vikings. He strikes a stunning balance of the abject and the gorgeous. Speaking of kaleidoscopic fever dreams, Eggers is a master of creating a vague sense of the supernatural. Certain sequences involving reanimated corpses and flying-horse-riding Valkyrie tease Norse belief as more than just legend. But then Eggers pulls back. He makes us question if Amleth is truly going through a mythical journey or if he’s merely hallucinating what he wishes to see. And Eggers never really provides a clear answer, similar to what he accomplishes with his previous two features. This ambiguity enhances this typical revenge tale into something even more engaging. Between battling enemies and plotting his revenge, Skarsgård anchors Amleth as the anti-hero. He believes he has a noble quest while leaving a trail of carnage in his wake. This is not a performance where Skarsgård necessarily has a particularly deep emotional performance. But he captures Amleth’s primary emotion of rage perfectly. He is animalistic, with his stance replicating that of a bear. He’s slightly hunched over and he holds his arms slightly away from his body with hands in fists. This constant intimidating physicality shows that this man is one-track-minded and will do anything to get his revenge.  Then, opposite Skarsgård, is the incredible Claes Bang as Fjölnir who is the smoldering bastard brother scorned. His cruelty is much more understated, despite what the film’s opening would suggest. Fjölnir is trying to make a quiet life for himself with his taken wife, his two sons, and his loyal soldiers. He reflects a certain degree of restraint at first. But that’s almost instantly released once Amleth begins to wreak havoc upon his small farmstead. Bang is able to strike a balance between a rage-filled man and a more sensitive soul just trying to live as peaceful a life as possible. Again, with Skarsgård and Bang, Eggers isn’t just telling a tale of good versus evil. Both of these characters are deeply flawed yet are sympathetic in their own ways. This creates a fascinating dynamic that leaves the viewer conflicted on who they want to come out victorious. And we cannot forget the iconic Nicole Kidman who, despite a small amount of screentime, absolutely chews up every minute she’s in front of the camera. A particular monologue at the end is a knife to the heart as Kidman captures the deep sadness of a woman scorned. While this is a movie that revolves mostly around masculinity, Kidman, and Taylor-Joy, make space for strong female voices who are mostly silenced in this time period.  The Northman is a classic story done perfectly. Eggers knows what makes a revenge tale effective, and injects it with his own flair for the deeply historical, vaguely supernatural, and hauntingly beautiful. While the film is steeped in Norse mythology, there’s no need to be super familiar with tales of Odin or the Valkerie. The Northman doesn’t demand previous knowledge, but instead an engaged viewer ready to dive into a new Eggers’ world that delivers gut punch after gut punch. This isn’t an arthouse film. This is a violent, expensive action-filled epic that proves that filmmakers like Eggers deserve this kind of studio support. So don your armor and practice your best primal yell, because The Northman will have you ready to dig into your most animalistic self. "
"Apr 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A sublime technical feat with no emotional core. Eggers doesn't offer anything new or subversive to the Hamlet tale, including its discussion on masculinity. Skarsgård feels miscast (or perhaps Anleth is just boring?)  "
"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE,It's all very bleak and cruel. And stylistically intoxicating.
"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers delivers exactly what you’d expect from the filmmaker in THE NORTHMAN. However unlike his previous projects, THE NORTHMAN may be the most straightforward film, but it still veers into the weird realm. THE NORTHMAN isn’t simply a revenge tale. Eggers and Icelandic author Sjorn imbued the script with Icelandic sagas and Norse myths which added intrigue by combining action and fantasy elements. The epic film is both beautiful and brutal in its depiction of the Viking age. Skarsgard's castmates are also impressive with Anya Taylor-Joy reteaming with Eggers, Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke, Claes Bang and a cameo by Björk. Ironically Kidman and Skarsgård played a couple and Big Little Lies and here the actors play mother and son. Taylor-Joy once again plays a witch type in her second outing with the Director. The Witch brought Taylor Joy to Hollywood’s attention for her performance. As usual, she’s quite striking and leaves an impression on the viewer as she does on the Viking Prince. Likewise, Skarsgard brings rage and a determination to Amleth that’s riveting. He plays it just right so as to not alienate the viewer with his scary presence. You are rooting for him to avenge his father. Even in the end when he commits some questionable acts, you feel for him. THE NORTHMAN is Egger's most ambitious film to date. Grand in scale, the mostly outdoor setting couldn’t have been an easy feat for the production given the landscape. While beautiful to look at, tracking your cast and crew in the mud was no walk in the park. However, it paid off. I had the privilege of watching THE NORTHMAN at the Dolby laboratories in Burbank California. The visuals and sound were top-notch. The sound design jumped off the screen with the Dolby Atmos speakers surrounding the screening room. It was the best cinematic experience I’ve had in a long time. The violence is quite brutal but it’s no surprise given the Viking theme. THE NORTHMAN is probably the most straightforward in Eggers filmography. His prior projects were hard to comprehend because of the specific tongue in which the characters spoke, but here there is no language barrier. It’s still not your ordinary film but it’s the least abstract of his movies. THE NORTHMAN is not for the faint of heart but the cinematic experience is quite profound that is a must-watch."
"Apr 26, 2022",NEUTRAL," The Northman looks and sounds like it cost $90 million to make. Robert Eggers is a master at his craft perfectly melding every element — particularly Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography — to create his Viking-era world. Where the movie goes south is in its narrative and characters. Beneath the twisting Scandinavian folklore is a simple and familiar revenge story that never gives us real reason to care. The movie lacks the emotional impact to become fully immersed. Still, Eggers is a masterful director and holds your attention even if the movie isn’t as narratively compelling as The Witch nor as visceral as The Lighthouse.

"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Its easy to get lost in time during those two hours.
"Apr 26, 2022",POSITIVE," The ninth century is drawing to a close. The Vikings have yet to convert to Christianity. Snow falls over the North Atlantic. Ravens fly about. In fact, the name of the local ruler is King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). He’s married to Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Several decades later, their son, Amleth, will be played by Alexander Skarsgård. Oh, and watch out for the king’s brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). That’s the set-up for Robert Eggers’s “The Northman.” It’s a brutal and brooding drilling down to the legend that underlies “Hamlet.” The film yokes together the intensely naturalistic and ludicrously mystical. You want to go to Valhalla? “The Northman” goes to Valhalla, though it takes a long time to get there. The movie doesn’t ultimately work, but that doesn’t mean much of it isn’t great. “Great” is a word that gets spread around in movie culture the way fake butter does on stale popcorn, only it’s greasier. Great this, great that. Yeah, right. Here, the word applies. In one sense, Eggers’s filmmaking is absolutely bravura. In another, it feels as natural as breathing. The most obvious example is a Viking raid on a village. Eggers films it with a kinetic dexterity that’s breathtaking (speaking of breathing). But throughout the movie there’s a phenomenal directorial assurance. Eggers’s camera is often prowling and restless. It’s never, never aimless. Thinking in images, which is rare enough, is one thing. Feeling with motion, which is even rarer, is another. Eggers does both. This is someone born to make movies. Many people, most of them male, will go see “The Northman” for its “Game of Thrones” goriness and accumulation of corpses. They won’t be disappointed, but they’ll be scratching their heads over a lot of what goes on between dismemberments. Another, much smaller group, will go see “The Northman” for Eggers’s artistry. They won’t be disappointed either, but instead of scratching their heads they’ll be covering their eyes. This is a world where cruelty is so casual it exists almost at a cellular level. You know that word “entrails”? Let’s just say “The Northman” is a movie where it isn’t just a word. Eggers’s fascination with the past and historical detail was central to his first two films, “The Witch” (2015) and “The Lighthouse” (2019). Here they’re not so much central as all-encompassing. He doesn’t just want to recreate and show how the Vikings lived. He wants to live there, too. It’s a world of log walls and straw-strewn floors, with mud everywhere underfoot outside those walls. Yet magic is as much a part of this world, as natural and inevitable a part, as all that mud is. Is this version of Viking life authentic? That’s a question for historians or anthropologists. It certainly feels authentic — there’s a sense of constant otherness to what we experience on the screen, yet with no sense of contrivance — and that’s what matters. Everything feels strange, savage, implacably other: royalty alongside slavery, formality prized yet pity nowhere to be found. “The Northman” seems so foreign, as it should. Yet what Eggers never forgets, and this does almost as much as his talent does to make his film so frequently compelling, is that what to the characters is mundane is to us unreal — and vice versa. “The Northman” presents an elemental world: earth (all that mud), fire, water. Especially water: rain, river, ocean, a general sense of damp. How do you think that dirt stays muddy? Visually, these elements provide an array of textures that Eggers and his very gifted cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, do wonders with, especially the various permutations of flame: torches, campfires, lava (yes, there’s a volcano). “The Northman” is as much about weather as it is about emotion. It’s weather as emotion. It’s also emotion as weather. (Kidman has an amazing scene with Skarsgård that’s part cyclone, part ice storm, and in an overpoweringly enclosed space.) These men and women live an existence in which meteorology can be a matter of life and death. The elements are elemental to them in a way we can barely imagine. An elemental quality informs “The Northman” generally. It makes sense of the characters’ excessive actions and unyielding behavior. Being a born filmmaker does not make Eggers a born writer. He collaborated on the script with the Icelandic author Sjón. Expect no lightness or wit in the film’s use of language. If it weren’t for the transporting density of Jimmy Boyle’s sound design and the excellence of the industrial-strength score, from Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, “The Northman” might be better experienced as viewing minus any listening. “Like a battle dog returning to its master, I am here to be fettered by my lady’s locks,” Aurvandill tells Gudrún. Woof, woof, your majesty, woof, woof. The casting can get pretty wild: Willem Dafoe as the king’s fool, Björk as a seeress (that’s the name of her character, Seeress). Pretty wild is not the same as unserious. It’s a version of elemental. Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays a Russian slave, is proof of that. She’s inspired casting. With that spooky changeling face of hers, Taylor-Joy fits right in in this world where the supernatural seems so utterly natural. Unfortunately, the character’s name is Olga of the Birch Forest. That’s worse than woof, woof. It’s woof, woof barking up the wrong tree."

"Apr 25, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers takes his knack for immersive storytelling and brings it to a larger, more epic scale with his latest film, The Northman. An unflinching, brutal telling of a revenge quest during the era of vikings, it is The Lighthouse and The Witch director’s most straight-forward, ambitious, and visceral work yet; while also feeling like less than his previous efforts. However, even in its most mundane plot, The Northman is a sight to behold and the work of a director who has cemented his ability to transport audiences into worlds inhabited by the strange and macabre without losing them along the way. Dedicated to its mythology and lore, Eggers and co-writer Sjón’s screenplay is relatively light on plot but dense in worldbuilding. A young boy, Amleth (played by Oscar Novak, with a timeskip that sees Alexander Skarsgård take the role), witnesses his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) be murdered by his father’s brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), subsequently be taken captive by him. Escaping and believed to be dead, Amleth sets forth on a quest to survive and avenge his father’s death when fate determines it to be the right time. There’s a slavish obsession with fate, destiny, and religion that every character seems to swear by – specifically with men, who barely think for themselves and instead heed the advice of shamans and mystics. It makes for a plot that is surprisingly devoid of much heft since everything just plays out as dictated. Reveals are hardly surprising and are kept too close to the chest than they warrant. It’s a quest for vengeance following a man whose entire life has been overwhelmed by bloodlust and savagery. The plot is straightforward because fate deprives characters of autonomy and they live their lives along a track until they realize that fate can also be altered. Within those fringes though, The Northman comes alive. Where its narrative lacks impact, its world building and characters pick up the slack. Male characters often resort to violence to solve matters and turn to women for guidance. It is no surprise that every female character in The Northman is more than just someone’s wife or love interest. They’re people who decide their own fate and push against the submissive behavior of the men in their lives governed by others and rarely acting of their own accord. A queen who seemingly finds herself a pawn in another man’s game is more than meets the eye, and the same goes for Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress and a slave whose path crosses and intertwines with Amleth’s but the two embrace each other’s strengths rather than her merely becoming a love interest for the hate-fuelled brute. Unsurprisingly, that hate colors the entirety of The Northman. Broken up into chapters, usually spelling out where geographically Amleth currently is, after the inciting incident each chapter gets progressively darker, though in different ways. Sometimes it’s a bit more insidious and others it’s far more bloodsoaked and gory. Each form of violence carries with it a visually distinctive look, occasionally leaning into the heavy metal vibes inherent to Viking bloodshed and other times capturing that dark, brooding atmosphere reminiscent of The Witch and other folk horror.  The aesthetic of The Northman is perhaps its biggest draw: matching scope and mythology with production design and special effects to create moments that are awe-inspiring. Fans of 2021’s The Green Knight will likely find themselves drawn to The Northman for similar reasons, but where the former maintains a specific style, The Northman sometimes shifts a bit, creating some jarring moments where the CG gets a little overwhelming and turns some moments into looking more similar to a Zack Snyder film or graphic novel than an attempt at gritty realism.  The Northman is a herculean effort to bring Viking mythology to a larger audience while still maintaining that distinctively bleak atmosphere that Eggers has forged with his previous films. The cast is enticing enough as they submit themselves completely to a vision that does not compromise itself by catering to a wider demographic. Watching The Northman is akin to reading some of the best fantasy – it rewards you for engaging with its world while not being afraid to completely submerge you in its denseness. The simplistic narrative and unflinching dedication to immersion is why The Northman feels like a complete, singular experience. Eggers isn’t just making movies set in different eras; he’s crafting experiences that feel unfamiliar yet beckon your undivided attention. While The Northman might be the director’s worst movie, that’s saying very little about the movie and a lot about the impeccable run Eggers has been having as of late. His cast is always impressive in their commitment to going down a very particular and dark road with him and it always pays off. That the film occasionally feels like it’s more committed to immersion than an interesting narrative says everything about how Eggers approaches his films. Stories within the worlds created often befit the setting and characters: The Witch broods in its supernatural horror; The Lighthouse drenches itself in paranoia as its characters completely unravel from isolation; and The Northman buries itself in a revenge-fuelled epic about family in a savage and brutal era.  Chris is a graduate of Communications from Simon Fraser University and resides in Victoria, British Columbia.

"Apr 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers has quickly established himself as an auteur with a specific voice, and The Northman proves that having a bigger budget only enhances his strengths."
"Apr 25, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman, a bloody saga of vengeance set largely against the green and grey and molten black of a newly-settled Iceland, is one of those films that is destined to please a niche audience, while leaving the general moviegoing public scratching their heads. This is born out in the gap between critics and audience. Critics enjoyed the Robert Eggers directed picture a great deal more, on average, than viewers. The Northman enjoys an 89% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, but its audience score is much lower at 67%. I double checked The Green Knight’s Rotten Tomatoes rating—the two films are quite different but share a focus on brooding cinematography, sparse dialogue and magical realism bordering on fantasy—and it faced much the same fate. 89% of critics liked the movie; just 50% of moviegoers agreed. I mention all this simply to note that this is a movie that is, almost by design, divisive and one that isn’t trying to please as wide a swath of viewers as possible. Even for fans of Viking stories and TV shows (think Vikings, The Last Kingdom) this movie might be too dark, too weird or too fantastical, too disturbing. But as far as I’m concerned, The Northman simply takes everything to the next level. It is a visually stunning, breathlessly violent, bone-crushingly metal take on Viking legend. It is also the story of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as told by director Eggers and writer Sigurjón Birgir Sigurðsson—aka Sjón. Only in this Hamlet the main character is named Amleth, which is just ‘Hamlet’ with the ‘H’ on the end instead of the beginning. We all know Hamlet, but I’ll throw in a spoiler warning here anyways. In Hamlet and in The Northman, a young Norse prince seeks to avenge his father who was slain by none other than his uncle. He vows to rescue his mother and take back his kingdom. Soon, he is entirely consumed by his hatred and revenge. It does not end well for anybody (though, miraculously, The Northman is just a little less bleak than Hamlet in the end). There are twists and turns along the way, and plenty that make this a far different offering than Shakespeare’s most famous play. For one thing, Hamlet is typically set some hundreds of years later, doesn’t involve brutal raids on Rus villages, has no chanting berserker warriors in wolf pelts and none of its characters ever set foot on Iceland, let alone raid ancient tombs to find magical swords. There are also no acts in Hamlet titled The Night Blade Feeds. Again, I won’t spoil what that means, but you can use your imagination. Alongside the mesmerizing cinematography, the sound design in The Northman will leave you dizzy. Beating drums, berserkers roaring, the howling of wolves, the deep guttural thrum of chanting voices and the clank of steel. Sometimes it’s hard to make out what characters are saying, the music and whispers and chanting can become so hectic and oppressive. At times, The Northman let’s you outside into a wide green field or beneath a starry sky. More often, the camera brings us in close, into dark smoky halls and chambers, into tight corners and dark caverns. The effect is claustrophobic. Swirling voices in your ears, smoke in your eyes and lungs, fire and shadow. Blood and steel. There isn’t a ton of dialogue. The plot is straightforward save for one rather upsetting twist. We never dig too deep into any of these characters, and by the end we’re still not sure who we should have been rooting for, if only because very few of these people are particularly likeable. Still, we get a sword fight in a volcano—does it really matter who wins in the end? For the most part, the casting was terrific. Alexander Skarsgård plays the titular Northman, Amleth—our Hamlet—and he absolutely kills in the roll. Skarsgård has always struck me as a guy who seems genuinely nice and pleasant in real life, but he takes on the role of vengeful barbarian with a dark passion (and a frighteningly ripped physique for such a lean 6’4” giant). Anya Taylor-Joy plays the Slavic witch, Olga of the Birch Forest, and is as good as ever. Willem Dafoe plays Heimir the Fool—half jester, half mad prophet. Dafoe is apparently having the time of his life, landing every interesting role he can get his paws on. Then there’s Icelandic pop-star Björk who plays a mystical Seeress in her first movie role in nearly two decades. You almost don’t recognize her in the wild attire they put her in. Claes Bang as Amleth’s uncle, Fjölnir The Brotherless, was excellent, stealing the show in every scene he was in. My biggest concerns going into the film were two much more established movie stars who simply felt out of place in my mind and in the film’s trailer. Ethan Hawke plays Amleth’s father, King Aurvandil War-Raven and Nicole Kidman plays Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún. My fears were both well-founded and not. Hawke really fell into the role to the point that I’d go entire scenes forgetting it was him almost altogether (at times he looked more like Josh Brolin to me, weirdly). I’m used to Hawke playing characters who generally look and sound like Hawke, but here he was a gruff, bearded, hulking Viking king and it worked shockingly well. Kidman is another story. I’m not sure what it is about her that’s rubbed me wrong for so long. I have genuinely enjoyed her in past films like Far and Away and Moulin Rouge but lately she just falls flat. Maybe it’s the fact that she looks and acts so much like Nicole Kidman here, but with a fake Norse accent. To me, her casting was immersion-breaking. I would have preferred someone less famous, perhaps, or who could disappear into the role in ways Kidman simply can’t. Don’t get me wrong—she did surprise me in the end, and I think she did a good job overall. But to me it still felt like this dark Norse saga was occasionally knocked off-kilter by her casting. Every time I saw her I would think “Nicole Kidman” rather than “Amleth’s mother the queen.” Sometimes films like this ought to leave the A-list talent out so that audiences can better immerse themselves in the story. Surely there are plenty of Scandinavian actors who could have better fit some of these roles? That complaint aside, I enjoyed almost every minute of The Northman. It’s a slow burn at times, but I never felt bored. This is one to see on the big screen. Indeed, I wish our local theater had it on the big Cine1 screen with Dolby Atmos sound, but that was occupied by The Bad Guys, which is what you should probably take your kids to instead of this if you don’t want to traumatize them and annoy other moviegoers.

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Robert Eggers’s The Northman is a somewhat surprising follow up to his two previous films, The Witch and The Lighthouse, which were small scale affairs that took place almost entirely in single locations. The Northman, on the other hand, is a true historical epic, spanning decades and continents even as its central story is more narratively generic than anything Eggers has made before.  The story is inspired by the legend of prince Amleth, which sounds an awful lot like Hamlet because it’s also the basis for Shakespeare’s play. But unlike that stately psychological drama, The Northman is more interested in the brutality of the Viking age.  We’re then transported years later and across the Eurasian continent to “the Land of the Rus” where adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has joined a band of Vikings and lives as a marauding berserker, but when he encounters a Seeress (Björk), he’s incited to return west to fulfill his fate. The film doesn’t spend much time on the journey and instead focuses on Amleth’s time on the farm of his uncle as he and a beautiful Slav slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) conspire to free themselves and avenge Amleth’s father.  It’s an undeniably generic revenge tale, but the plot isn’t the focus here, it’s the world that Eggers brings us into. It’s a world of open landscapes and oceans shot beautifully by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who has worked with Eggers since The Witch and was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on The Lighthouse. But that beauty is contrasted with the matter of fact brutality of the violence that fills this world, from Aurvandill’s death by many arrows, and spears, and a sword, to the burning alive of children in the Land of the Rus.  That’s all before the gore that attends Amleth’s protracted revenge, including forming dismembered bodies into a statue and removing a heart. Eggers does show some sensitivity though as we do not directly witness the burning of children, and while it is made clear that rape is a significant part of this world, the film has no rape scenes. It’s an interesting choice, and one that certainly contrasts with Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale as a portrait of a cruel world, but it may be that The Northman wants to maintain some semblance of genre fun.  And there is fun to be had here. The action sequences, full of tracking shots and hard hitting choreography, are absolutely thrilling, even if some of the methods of murder are squirm inducing. There is a surprising amount of humor, ranging from a fart joke to clever wordplay, which brings the world of the film to greater life by not overly committing to a bleak and unforgiving tone for its significant runtime. Eggers’s first forays into major CGI, which brings images of volcanoes, giant trees, both literal and metaphysical, and visions of Valhalla to the screen, are visually striking even if they are more ambitious than crisply detailed.  There are some flaws in this overwhelmingly beautifully realized film though. Some plot points are unnecessary, slowing the momentum of the film’s generally brisk pacing and overcomplicating the narrative’s mostly simple theme. The accents, which differ from actor to actor, are initially distracting. Once we’ve accepted that this is just how the movie is dealing with language, it suddenly begins to include subtitled sections of speech where the actors speak in (more) accurate language begging the question why Eggers didn’t just commit to having the actors perform in those languages à la The Passion of the Christ, or not include those languages at all.  Ultimately, these issues are all the more frustrating because the rest of the movie is otherwise so successful in bringing this world to life so wonderfully, as well as maintaining strong narrative momentum over the course of its many chapters. The Northman isn’t an original story, but it is an original moviegoing experience due to Eggers direction, Blaschke’s cinematography, and the beautifully ominous score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough.

"Apr 25, 2022",POSITIVE," Now we have ""The Northman,"" Eggers' biggest movie yet. It once again deals with characters from a bygone era — specifically, the late 800s. And once again, Eggers has his characters butting up against the traditions and expectations set by their faith and era. Like his previous two movies, ""The Northman"" is loaded with symbolism, surreal happenings, and bursts of horror. All the pieces are in place. And yet ... this is Eggers' most disappointing film.  It is to the director's credit that his first true stumble (I maintain ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse"" are both phenomenal) is still a damn good movie. It just could've been better. It could've been more ... Eggersy (for lack of a better term). Working with a big cast and a big budget meant Eggers had to adhere to studio notes. By the filmmaker's own admission, this was the first of his movies that he had to go back and recut due to poor test screenings. This resulted in Eggers adding additional dialogue to clarify certain things that left test viewers puzzled. And while Eggers states that the theatrical cut of the movie is his ""director's cut,"" there's a part of me that really wants to see the pre-test audience version of the film. Because I have a feeling deep in my bones it's weirder, and better, than the film that is now playing in theaters.  Eggers establishes all of this with his keen eye, creating a cold, dirty, bleak world lit by flickering fires and murky skies. He also isn't afraid to get weird early, staging a ritualistic scene between young Amleth and his father, overseen by Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe). This involves a drug trip of sorts, complete with a vision of a literal family tree upon which all of Amleth's decedents hang like rotten apples. This is followed by the violence of Aurvandill's death coupled with the ravaging of Amleth's village, complete with women tossed from great heights only to smash into the ground, and children ripped from their mothers. Eggers is making it clear from the start: this is going to be weird and violent! And yet, ""The Northman"" is also Eggers' most accessible film. It follows a rather straightforward path; a revenge narrative where everything happens more or less exactly as you think it will. But it's the lurking strangeness that makes ""The Northman"" really stand out.  Years later, Amleth, now all grown up in full berserker mode, learns that Fjölnir's stolen kingdom was quickly stolen in return. Fjölnir now lives in exile in Iceland. Now is the time for revenge, spurned on by a vision by an eyeless witch, played by Björk in a memorable cameo. Off Amleth goes, posing as a slave. He quickly befriends another slave, Olga, who seems to be a witch herself. She's played, appropriately enough, by Eggers' ""Witch"" star Anya Taylor-Joy. Taylor-Joy's role here is ultimately smaller than you might expect, but she makes every moment of it count. With her snowy-pale skin and unique, intense eyes, Taylor-Joy has built a distinguishable brand for herself just like Eggers, and they work well together. Custom dictates that Olga and Amleth fall for each other, and why shouldn't they? Skarsgård and Taylor-Joy are both preternaturally attractive people! Unfortunately, they don't have much chemistry. This is primarily due to how Skarsgård plays Amleth: a hulking, monosyllabic killer frequently shirtless while covered in gore and filth. It's right for the role, but it doesn't exactly lend itself to romance. Then again, it might, depending on who you ask.  
When Amleth and Olga arrive in Fjölnir's new home, Amleth catches glimpses of his mother. She's married to Fjölnir now, and the two of them even have a young son (Elliott Rose). None of this bothers Amleth: he's convinced his mother is only going along with all of this because she has no choice. And he's here to rescue her! Thus the stage is set for what begins to feel like a video game, as Amleth moves from one quest to the next to enact his revenge. First, he fights a gigantic corpse known as The Mound Dweller, and it was here I truly perked up. The design of this sword-wielding zombie is wonderful, all ghoulish delights and practical make-up. But Eggers does a curious thing here: after the fight has ended and Amleth has won, a quick bit of camera trickery reveals the corpse hasn't moved at all. It was all seemingly in Amleth's head, just like the vision of Björk. 

This ultimately bothered me. There are more than a few supernatural moments in ""The Northman,"" but Eggers needlessly adds a bit of an asterisk to all of them, revealing they're not really happening, they're just part of Amleth's fevered mind. I assume that Eggers was going for a touch of realism while keeping fantastical elements in play — but why? Why not allow the supernatural to simply exist, as it did in ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse""? It feels like hedging; as if the filmmaker was worried the movie might get too supernatural. But that's exactly what I was hoping for. 
Olga and Amleth continue to terrorize the village. Olga drugs some guards to the point that they begin self-mutilating themselves during a bad trip; Amleth murders people and stages their severed limbs in artistic poses; the body count rises, and concerns grow. And then the film's most interesting, if predictable, twist arises. Finally confronting his mother, Amleth is shocked to learn that Queen Gudrún is not some hapless victim. She reveals she has no love for Amleth's slain father. In fact, she hated him, as she was once his slave before their union. She encouraged Fjölnir to murder Aurvandill. And just to make this entire thing extra unpleasant, she plants a big romantic kiss on her long-lost son and tells him that if he wants, he can kill Fjölnir and she can serve as Amleth's queen. After Amleth rejects this, Gudrún turns on him, and freely admits she wants her son dead.  

There's a lot to unpack here. Revealing that Gudrún was in on Aurvandill's murder is a great twist, and while the mother-son smooching is designed to make us all uncomfortable, it wasn't exactly unheard of at the time and in the culture that these characters exist. Kidman, never one to miss some good scene-chewing, really leans into her heel-turn. And her incestuous suggestion to Amleth just raises more questions. Was she really in on Aurvandill's death? Does she really love Fjölnir? Or is she doing everything she can in order to survive in a harsh world? It's a great moment, and the movie could've used more like it. Alas, there's action to be had!

There's a lot of action in ""The Northman."" But Eggers doesn't seem entirely comfortable with it. The fight scenes are staged in long shots, usually filmed wide. That's great, in theory! So many modern movies blur their action with quick cuts and incomprehensible visuals. Showing it all is commendable. The problem is that Eggers' approach often leaves a lot to be desired. While plenty brutal, the action is frequently unconvincing. Clubs don't connect with skulls as hard as they should. Swords don't slash close enough to skin. While it makes sense that the action should be lumbering and unchoreographed — these characters are Vikings, not ninjas — the end result is consistently unsatisfying. For a movie that seems to pride itself on its brutality, ""The Northman"" is lacking in bite. 

Still, Eggers is strong enough of a filmmaker to overcome these issues. And to his credit, the final fight between Amleth and Fjölnir is staged brilliantly, with the two men completely nude and fighting against flowing lava from an erupting volcano. In the end, like so many other Eggers characters before, Amleth cannot escape his fate. He is a man who lives by violence, and so he must die by it as well. There's a brief moment of hope — Olga reveals she is pregnant with Amleth's child, and Amleth has a vision that she's actually going to have twins. Amleth and Olga have a chance to run away together and live happily ever after — but Amleth cannot. He must kill. And kill he does. First, he kills his mother. Then he kills his half-brother. Then he and Fjölnir fight, both dying in the process. It's a fitting ending.  

Eggers' attention to period details remains superb, and when he's allowed to unleash weirdness, it's wonderful (Willem Dafoe's skull pops up midway through the film to offer Amleth some advice, for instance). The cast is solid through and through, be it Hawke's rough and vulgar king, Skarsgård's brooding killer, Taylor-Joy's otherworldly witch, or Kidman's hammy queen. I also appreciated how understated Claes Bang is as Fjölnir — he refuses to play the character as a sneering villain. Why, then, with all this good, does ""The Northman"" lack the punch of Eggers' previous works? The only logical answer is studio interference to make the film as accessible to the mainstream as possible. Again: Eggers swears this is his preferred cut, and I will take his word for it. But I am convinced there's a better version of this movie out there somewhere. Perhaps we'll get to see it someday.

"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," He made the world take notice with his 2015 feature debut, the period horror film “The Witch,” which he followed up in 2019 with the psychological ordeal that was “The Lighthouse.” In his director’s statement for “The Northman” — a largely stunning, often-offbeat movie that lands in U.S. theaters this week — Eggers talks of wanting to make “THE Viking movie. The definitive Viking movie.” It’s quite a turnaround for him. To hear Eggers tell it, he wasn’t exactly spurred to action by his wife, who was convinced that if he made an effort, he, like she, would become interested in Icelandic Sagas and Viking lore. Apparently, he was more or less “meh” about it. However, that changed after the pair visited Iceland in 2015, where he found himself imagining “solitary tenth-century figures on horseback” against the region’s almost-unbelievable landscapes. This newfound passion eventually led him to Alexander Skarsgård, the one-time “True Blood” actor who for years had been working to star in and produce a Viking movie. Skarsgård turns in an impressive performance in a movie that is both beautiful and brutal. Its opening moments, in which thunder crashes around a mountain and a man with a gravelly voice addresses the Norse god Odin, are guttural and forceful and prove to be a microcosm of “The Northman.” While Skarsgård portrays Prince Amleth as a man, it begins around 900 A.D. with a younger version played by Oscar Novak, who also was seen recently as young Bruce Wayne in “The Batman.” Amleth is excited for the return of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke, “Moonknight”), to him and his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, “Being the Ricardos”), in the fictitious island kingdom of Hrafnsey, located somewhere around the Orkney and Shetland Islands, near the top of present-day Great Britain. Fearing he may not have much time left on this earth, Aurvandil concludes he must prepare Amleth for what lies ahead of him — including a duty to avenge his father’s future death. And thus we get a wild ritual shared by the two and orchestrated by the court jester and valued advisor to the king, Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe, one of Eggers’ “Lighthouse” stars), serving here as a shaman-like figure. Soon, Aurvandil is killed, not by opposing forces but by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who takes Hrafnsey — and Gudrún — for himself. He also orders his men to kill Amleth, but the boy is able to flee the area. When we catch up with Amleth 20 years later, he is raiding Slavic villages with other Viking Berserkers. At one brutality-laden stop, he encounters a seeress (Björk), who reminds him of his fate and responsibility for vengeance. (Björk — the brilliant Icelandic singer-songwriter, who hasn’t been seen on screen since 2005’s “Drawing Restraint 9,” is so musically enchanting with the delivery of her spoken words that you may not fully absorb them.) Having learned his uncle has lost the kingdom to a greater force and now runs a farm in Iceland, Amleth disguises himself as a slave and boards a ship bound for the area. A real slave, Olga of the Birch Forest (“The Witch” star Anya Taylor-Joy), knows he is an imposter but stays quiet, the two forming a bond that will remain strong long after they arrive at the farm. There, Amleth proves himself to be more capable than most slaves, impressing Fjölnir and Gudrún and gaining him certain privileges and responsibilities in the process. All the while, he schemes to avenge his father and rescue his mother and is willing to unleash a hellish new reality onto his unsuspecting uncle. Eggers co-wrote “The Northman” with Icelandic poet, novelist, lyricist and screenwriter Sjón (“Lamb”), and they have crafted a story that, while relatively simple and familiar, is rich with detail. They have infused it with supernatural touches that, Eggers says, would be seen as realistic to the characters. (Well, maybe, but we won’t quibble.) And many of its details come to glorious life thanks largely to director of photography Jarin Blaschke, who also worked on Eggers’ other features. Iceland, especially, looks incredible and dramatic — and not quite in the same way a 4K video of the country you may pull up on YouTube to show off your television does — but it’s the movie’s elaborate tracking shots that are most impressive. The aforementioned raid of Olga’s village clearly took high-level preparation, coordination and execution, and it’s captured magnificently. In front of the camera, Skarsgård (“The Legend of Tarzan”) — who clearly put on muscle mass for the role and appears to have been in god-like shape — is a force. The singularly focused Amleth isn’t the most dynamic of characters, but the actor keeps you reasonably invested in his plight. Kidman’s role is rather small — albeit greater than other high-profile players Hawke and Dafoe — but when the “Big Little Lies” costars finally share the screen again, deep into the film, we get some impactful minutes. Bang, a Danish actor who played key parts in two 2020 arthouse films about art, “The Burnt Orange Heresy” and “The Last Vermeer,” is, well, rather artful in his portrayal of Fjölnir. That the character isn’t your typical villain also is a credit to Eggers and Sjón. One of the disappointments of “The Northman” is that the scribes didn’t make Taylor-Joy’s role isn’t meatier. The talented star of “Emma” and “The Queen’s Gambit” makes the most of some key scenes, but the film simply would have been stronger with more of her. Some may also be let down by the movie’s pacing; it has what could be considered an odd rhythm, and for all its action, it can be slow at times. That said, “The Northman” is more accessible than “The Lighthouse” — and maybe “The Witch,” as well — and the hope here is it earns a wide audience."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," This is going to be a combination of 2 reviews and a look at the box office, so if only one side interests you and I get bogged down in one, I’ll get back to your interest soon. "
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," With his 2015 debut “The Witch” (stylized as “The VVitch”) and its 2019 follow-up “The Lighthouse,” director Robert Eggers firmly established himself as one of the premier modern artistic visionaries. With a combined budget of $15 million, the two films grossed close to $60 million which, in the art-house world, is considered blockbuster territory. Given a hero’s welcome by his subjects and family, Aurvandill soon informs his wife Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) that his war wounds have tapped his ability to lead. So disabled, he decides to abdicate the throne to their preteen son Amleth (Oscar Novak) and return to the fight where he hopes he’ll eventually die in battle. This confidential news makes its way to Fjolnir (Claes Bang), Aurvandill’s already envious brother who will have none of it and assassinates him in an ambush, which Amleth witnesses before barely escaping a certain grizzly death. Some 20-odd years later, Amleth (now played by a ripped Alexander Skarsgard) is the member of a rather raucous band of Vikings who pass their time with nighttime campfire rituals and pillaging villages in the “Land of the Rus” (now Russia and Belarus). As violent as anything seen in “Braveheart” (but with far more interesting camera work), Eggers lets the audience know early on he’ll be holding nothing back. It is after one such encounter that Amleth is addressed by the Seeress (frequent Sjon collaborator Bjork), an apparitional prophet, informing him that it is now time to begin his long-planned journey to avenge his father’s murder, rescue his mother (now Fjolnir’s queen) and claim the crown. Amleth purposefully gets caught, put into slavery, and eventually lands in Iceland, now the province of his uncle. At the same time, he meets and mutually falls in love with Olga (Ana Taylor-Joy), a Slavic sorceress who also catches the wandering eye of Fjolnir and is more than willing to assist Amleth in his mission. Shot entirely in Ireland, at times the color passages in “The Northman” bare a strong visual resemblance to both the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy and Ari Aster’s 2018 jarring Nordic “daymare”: “Midsommar.” Masters of depth and contrast, Eggers and his regular cinematographer Jarin Blashchke present close to half of the 137 minute film in traditional black and white alongside bleached color stock and the result is an unnerving palate of smoky grays and gun-barrel blues. It goes without saying this is a movie that should be watched on the biggest screen you can possibly find. Coupled with a brilliant prerelease ad campaign, mostly glowing reviews and a debut at over 2,700 U.S. theaters (with some houses offering hourly starting times on multiple screens), it would be quite surprising if the movie doesn’t pass the $20 million mark by the end of the weekend. Add to that the audience fatigue of interchangeable superhero comic book flicks, the time is ripe for this movie to become a huge hit and for Skarsgard to emerge as a household name. He may be crowned as the industry’s next go-to action star to boot. He’d also make a great James Bond. It will be interesting to see what Eggers does next. He’s managed to establish a unique brand with just three features without getting repetitive or stale in the process. With “The Northman,” he’ll still please his established base while roping in mainstream audiences who are looking for an inspiring story of redemption and a lead character with unwavering moral conviction. That’s a fine line to navigate and Eggers has pulled it off without breaking nary a sweat."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers’ “The Northman” feels as if it has left this century and firmly carried the viewer into some very distant past. Eggers isn’t merely making a “Viking movie.” What he has done is conjure another world so vividly even in its mindset. This film has no sense that it was made in the 21st century. Its characters truly feel as if they have no idea of what the future holds. This work of art breathes, thinks and yearns for revenge in a reality that is ancient and pagan. Few mainstream films are allowed to be this bold, combining hallucinatory imagery with visceral action. Eggers tells a Nordic revenge story classic in its accessibility, but fueled with a style that refuses to water down the material. The action begins in the year 895. King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returns to his kingdom on the Irish coast after carrying out a military campaign overseas. Waiting are his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandill believes it is time to begin passing the throne over to Amleth and partakes with him in an ancient Norse ritual. But before Amleth can rise further, he witnesses Aurvandill’s murder at the hands of the king’s own brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth flees and years later, he is a rampaging “Berserker” Viking warrior (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) pillaging around the lands of the Rus (modern-day Ukraine and Russia). When Amleth learns that Fjölnir now lives isolated in Iceland with Gudrún, he boards a slave ship where he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and steels himself to extract bloody revenge. If the plotting of “The Northman” sounds vaguely familiar, that’s because the Amleth story was a direct inspiration for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” That’s more of a general fun fact. Eggers crafts a ferocious revenge saga with the acclaimed Icelandic author Sjón, whose surrealistic style no doubt fuels some of the movie’s more hallucinatory moments. Eggers himself has been acclaimed as a director of films of spellbinding ambiance. His 2016 debut, “The Witch,” evoked real dread with Goyaesque images. 2019’s “The Lighthouse” was a stream of consciousness trip that felt completely insane. “The Northman” is the filmmaker’s most streamlined narrative, though never lacking in his meticulous obsession for period detail. Eggers seeks to transport the viewer into his Nordic dream, never bothering with too much explanation. We are meant to be there. It is as easy to follow as any revenge saga, but fused with the anthropological richness of films like “Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.” Aurvandill and Amleth engage in a primal ceremony in a fire-lit cavern, with a warlock watching over them. They snarl and howl. We don’t need too much explaining, we are aware we’re in some other age.  While Vikings have been the subject of numerous movies before, and a successful History Channel series, even the slightly better films like “The 13th Warrior” focused too much on the classic, muscle action archetypes. There is plenty of violence and combat in “The Northman,” but it’s more surreal than phony. Eggers captures the mindset of the period as opposed to approaching it like an outsider. Characters speak in the language of the “Poetic Edda” and have no time for standard Hollywood romance. This gives the material an even more potent, genuinely mythological feel. Amleth falls in love with Olga, yet not in some sweeping adventure sense. He sees visions of her in his mind, makes love with her, but while bound to a ruthless society. He seeks to avenge his father and reveal his presence to Gudrún, waging a campaign of planned killings in the village now run by Fjölnir, sometimes leaving corpses arranged in ritualistic formations. To love someone in this film means to truly kill for them. Christianity as a new religion is barely a shadow, rumored about here and there. A Valkyrie charges ahead in the night sky with a war cry in Amleth’s visions, and we are tempted to believe that for Eggers, at least in the world of his movie it isn’t pure myth.  Some of the performances in this movie are nothing less than possessed by the environment. The legendary Björk makes a small appearance as a painted seer and looks quite capable of casting a trance. Nicole Kidman brings regal strength to her rugged surroundings, while hiding a violent darkness in her stare. Willem Dafoe brings his maddened charm to his small role as a court jester, Heimir the Fool. All the mythic weight is of course on the hero, Alexander Skarsgård, who in his first scenes is nearly unrecognizable beneath the bloodied mud, wolf skins and long hair of a Berserker. He taps into pure barbarism in scenes where he bites a man’s face or screams his demands from a hilltop. There is a mind at work inside the savage, however, and his moments with Anya Taylor-Joy have a quieter tenderness. He would like to simply live in Nordic domestic bliss with her, but violence and brute settling of scores is the norm. Taylor-Joy, who communed with satanic forces in Eggers’ “The Witch,” is a bit too ethereal here. She’s effective, but can feel like a convenient, almost dreamy plot device to soften Amleth’s single-minded crusade. The late great Ursula K. Le Guin, in reviewing Neil Gaiman’s popular book of Norse myths, wondered why authors attempted to romanticize Viking legends as if they could work as children’s tales. By nature, these timeless, fascinating narratives (at least the ones that have survived) are violently nihilistic. Eggers gets it and never really tries to apply modern morality to Amleth’s journey. In “The Northman,” to die in battle is glorious. Riding into Valhalla on a Valkyrie’s steed is what you should look forward to, not a friendly compromise. Fittingly enough, the movie’s great climax is set on the foot of an Icelandic volcano, with hellish flames and lava. Leave at the door expectations of a regular action-adventure romp when walking into “The Northman.” Eggers has made something unique in its attempt at placing you somewhere else. The music score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, as primal and bestial as the plot, completes the overpowering effect of this film. It’s soaked in blood, yet hiding a particular kind of eloquence, even as it hits you like Thor’s hammer."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman, written by Sjón and director Robert Eggers, is easily the film I’m most excited about this year. I’ve reached a point where I’m getting burnt out on all the superhero flicks. Okay, I guess you can all kill me now, but that’s how I feel. So to know that something that cost $90 million to make is an original piece of intellectual property is incredibly refreshing when it seems as though Disney/Marvel owns the big-budget entertainment universe. If you’ve known me for even twenty seconds, you know that I am borderline obsessed with Alexander Skarsgard. So when I heard that this was coming out a few years ago, it was my most hotly anticipated film of, I don’t know, the decade? Then you add in the fact that Eggers, who is nothing short of an absolute genius, is directing. Then, with the announcement of the addition of another one of my all-time favorite actors, Ethan Hawke, to the cast, I was geeking out hard. So, when I got the press email, I immediately threatened the rest of the Film Threat staff [in the spirit of the film — Editor’s Note] with bodily harm if I didn’t get to review it. Of course, I don’t think I would never actually resort to physical violence over a motion picture. Who knows? Stranger things have happened. Anyway, I was overjoyed that I would be able to see the film before its public release. However, this has nothing to do with the content, and I’m sure you’re all begging me, possibly out loud, to shut the hell up and get to the actual review. The Northman is an amalgamation of Icelandic Eddaic poetry and Norse mythology in an original, timeless tale. It begins with some ravens flying. This is shot in a way only Eggers’ longtime cinematographer, Jarin Blaschke, can shoot it. We then look down on Viking ships arriving at a seashore. Young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) can tell from looking at the horizon that his father’s coming home. So he runs to the Queen’s chambers. His mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman in a bravura performance), almost hits Amleth for bursting in while she’s dressing, but then he announces that “father is here!” she changes her mind. Eventually, we meet Amleth’s father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke in another bravura performance), and his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang, in… you guessed it, another bravura performance). They’ve returned from doing their Viking conquering thing and are ready to celebrate. We find out after the celebration that War-Raven has been wounded badly in the liver. He declares it’s time for Amleth to find out the spiritual secrets of kings. What follows is one of many psychedelic scenes where there’s a lot of chanting and hallucinations. After the ritual is over, a grand betrayal sends Amleth away from his family home. If Satan was the antagonist of Robert Eggers’ first movie, The Witch, then God might be the antagonist of his second movie, The Lighthouse. Even though...

"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is Hamlet. Or at least both were
derived from the same source material, a Norse legend set in the early 900s
about the revenge of a prince upon the uncle who murdered his father and wed
his mother. However, while there was a surfeit of talking in Shakespeare’s
version of the tragedy, Robert Eggers’ movie features very little of it,
allowing the visuals to impel the narrative forward.  For anyone who has seen The Witch or The Lighthouse, it will be evident that The Northman comes from the same
director and that the injection of money into the production hasn’t dampened his
singular vision. The movie is dark, twisted, and steeped in the supernatural.
It delights in making the viewer feel off-balance. There are no heroes or
villains. Everyone has a point-of-view that emphasizes the rightness of their
actions while demonizing those of others. Because the story is presented
through the eyes of Amleth (the Hamlet character – take the “h” from the end
and put it at the beginning – played by Alexander Skarsgard), we generally perceive
him as being a righteous avenger…at least until his mother, Queen Gudrun
(Nicole Kidman), disabuses him of a few foundational truths. Whether intentional or not, the movie seems influenced both
by Conan the Barbarian and Game of Thrones – the latter more in
tone than in specifics; the former in certain plot details (“The Thing in the
Crypt” in particular). Like Shakespeare’s Hamlet, The Northman
employs supernatural elements – witchcraft, magic, and the visions of seers
(one of whom is played by Bjork). Yorick gets renamed as “Heimir” and is played
by Willem Dafoe – that actor’s participation establishes him as an “Eggers
regular.” Ditto for Anya Taylor-Joy, who got her breakthrough in The Witch
and has returned here to play Olga, Amleth’s love interest whose influence is
not unlike that of Lady Macbeth. Eggers is cognizant of period detail so, as in David Lowery’s
The Green Knight and Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel, everyone is very
dirty all the time. There’s a fair amount of nudity but none is excessive,
gratuitous, or lingering. During one post-coital scene, for example, the actor
and actress arrange themselves so that the only things shown to the camera are
a buttock or two. The most startling piece of human physique is Alexander
Skarsgard’s perfectly sculpted chest, which is shown to good effect on a number
of occasions. The movie opens with the return home of King Aurvandil
War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) from a glorious victory. The introductory scenes
establish two key things: the apparent affection between Aurvandil and his
queen and the tension between him and his brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang). Not
long after the king teaches his son of the importance of avenging the murder of
a loved one, Amleth is given an opportunity to act on that lesson. Fjolnir
commits fratricide and takes everything that his brother once owned (including
his wife) as his own. Amleth escapes to “the land of Rus,” where he develops a
frightening reputation as a warrior. But he is haunted by dreams hinting at his
fate and ends up doing whatever is necessary to track down Fjolnir – who has
been deposed and now runs a small hamlet on the forbidding island of Iceland –
and enact his revenge. Helping him is Olga, a fellow slave who knows a thing or
two about potions. One of the strengths of The Northman is that it plays
out as expected without ever being predictable. It’s a bold, uncompromising
film that doesn’t self-censor when it comes to blood and gore. Still, a lot of the
most gruesome moments are hinted at more than shown, allowing the viewer’s
imagination to fill in the blanks. If there’s one area in which the movie
stumbles, it’s that the supernatural fever dreams become something of a
narrative crutch. Eggers keeps the experience visually interesting. Many
scenes are filmed in a state of near-total color desaturation, resulting in
images that are monochromatic. The naked, untamed terrain of Iceland is
presented in all its widescreen glory. The director favors longer shots over
short ones and there’s one extended single-take that follows the sacking and
pillaging of a town from start to finish – the latter moment occurring when a
house full of children is set ablaze by the invaders. Alexander Skarsgard has transformed himself into a hulking
monster – quite unlike any previous version of Hamlet to grace the screen. He
has a keen intellect but is blinded by his need for vengeance. Only toward the
end does he begin to see beyond his lifelong obsession. Nicole Kidman doesn’t
have a lot to do but her one showy scene is rich with twists, turns, and barbed
daggers. Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga is comely, loyal, and deadly.  Like Akira Kurosawa’s three films with strong Shakespearean
connections (Throne of Blood, The Bad Sleep Well, and Ran), The
Northman illustrates that a compelling production can be mounted without
the benefit of the Bard’s dialogue. The Northman is gripping cinema of
the sort that we get too little of today, when too often a director’s vision is
diluted by box office imperatives and the lure of four-quadrant appeal. "
"Apr 24, 2022",NEUTRAL," If you like brawling, bloody brutality, head for “The Northman,” Robert Eggers’ intense Nordic nightmare.  Eggers’ previous films – “The Witch” (2015) and “The Lighthouse” (2019) – blurred the boundary between fantasy and reality, so it’s not surprising that this Viking revenge saga follows suit. That evening, harking back to their feral wolf ancestors, young Amleth, wounded Aurvandill and the wild-eyed holy man Heimir (Willem Dafoe) journey to a cave where they engage in an intoxicating pagan ritual that induces howling and vivid hallucinations. Later, while walking with Amleth in the forest, Aurvandill is ambushed and assassinated by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang). Vowing vengeance, Amleth hides from his uncle, eventually escaping to Iceland. Years later (914 A.D.), a witch (Bjork) reminds now-adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) of his fate. Then he’s captured and brought as a slave to Fjolnir, now married to duplicitous Gudrun who begat another son.  Complicating matters, Amleth has fallen in love with clever captive Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). If you’re into Icelandic folklore, you’ll recognize that Amleth is the Viking name for Hamlet, thus heralding this viscerally violent Scandinavian inspiration for Shakespeare’s tale. Historically, Amleth’s story can be traced back in “The History of the Danes.” The dialogue is banal – apparently, Vikings weren’t very articulate – so Eggers and his DP Jarin Blaschke concentrate on violent, medieval mayhem.  To achieve authenticity, production designers worked overtime, replicating ancient carvings and creating costumes of nettle, reindeer leather and the outer coats of Icelandic sheep. One of the recurring thematic images is the sacred Tree of Kings, based on the giant ash tree Yggdrasil – central to Norse mythology. It’s fashioned from human veins and hung with the dead bodies of warriors."
"Apr 24, 2022",POSITIVE," The night before I saw The Northman I carved out an hour of video game time, which plunged me back into the Viking saga that is Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. I, a Norse leader with brutal ax moves and cool hair, ventured across Britain after my brother, whose destiny was tied to my own per trippy visions littered throughout the game. My first task was to find some dude and get my bro’s location from him. I didn’t get past this task in my allotted hour, though, because when I found him he passed me off to some monk, who told me to find a drunk under a bridge, who sent me to a nearby castle to kidnap someone, and between the bridge and the castle I ran into an old enemy I had to kill (such important assassinations involve taking out lots of minions and then a cutscene where you slide your knife into the person’s heart, the camera following your blade into the person’s innards).  Fetch quests and protracted story arcs like this one are as common to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla as quick, bloody raids are, which combined with all the mythology and viscera ended up being the best primer for The Northman’s riff on the legend of Amleth this novice of Scandinavian culture has encountered. Plenty of its two-plus hour runtime is spent twiddling its thumbs and getting sidetracked, just like I did the night before, and more than a few of its visions seemed rooted in the same crap-I-went-in-the-wrong-cave-and-now-a-fox-is-talking-to-me style storytelling. Are these common aspects of Scandinavian lore? Perhaps (I’m no expert), but you wouldn’t guess it from the way The Northman plays nearly every beat of its story with the pomp and circumstance of a grand story you’ve never seen before. It’s true that Viking sagas are rare at this scale of filmmaking, but one must remember that film isn’t the only storytelling method out there. There are things, of course, that no other medium does as well, and co-writer/director Robert Eggers is an undisputed master of atmospheric, immersive filmmaking. In just his third film after The Witch and The Lighthouse, The Northman drops you into the murky, grimy world of the first millennium, where candle-lit interiors make you squint to see how much blood is soaking everyone’s clothes (it’s a lot). It’s a place where ominous visions lurk around every corner and the division between man and beast is thin, and the sheer breadth of possibility within this immaculately constructed world is enough to carry the vast majority of its runtime. Which is good, because the story of Amleth doesn’t exactly pop with originality or meaning. When I first heard the basic setup, that young Amleth sees his father murdered by his uncle and becomes consumed by his need for revenge, I flippantly categorized it as a Viking Hamlet. My concept of time, of course, was wildly off; The story of Amleth is far older and is a precursor to Hamlet, meaning this is, with little exaggeration, a tale as old as time. That makes the plot is a tired one to drag out for more than two hours, and the slack must be picked up by the atmosphere (already a noted success) and the underlying emotional and thematic threads (not successful, its failure broken down below). Amleth is the unwavering focus of the movie, played briefly by the wide-eyed and game child actor Oscar Novak and in adulthood by Alexander Skarsgård. I doubt anyone is wondering why Alexander was cast; he’s a hulk of a man that looks good in Eggers’ meticulous frames, which have never shied away from a nude body. But Alexander has been in on the project from square one, a credited producer intent on bringing the myth and the ethos of his native Scandinavian lore to the big screen. Interviews make this out to be a passion project for him, and while the drive can be seen in the way he throws his body into what was almost certainly a grueling production, it doesn’t come across in the development of character or theme. Amleth is a perpetual known unknown, a quiet man with fearsome tunnel vision. One wonders, watching him go about the business of slaughter, whether he’s ever considered other ways of life (when the answer comes, it’s a beat of such serious silliness that I was unsure if I was supposed to laugh). Other characters who encounter his brutish mission bounce off him with unsurprising ease. I mean, how is a cunning woman (Anya Taylor-Joy, whose cunning is fungi identification, I guess) supposed to pull time away from this vacuum of a central character? Everyone else is played by equally skilled and recognizable performers; Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, and an in-movie game of Spot The Witch Cast make it feel like the characters in his orbit have dimensions that simply don’t pan out. And Skarsgård, at the center of it all, is a familiar man without an ounce of unexpected drives or faults, an enchanting but uninteresting vessel. By the time the inevitable conclusion rolls around, the film’s atmosphere has lost its thrill to the cold, plodding story that would’ve wrapped up an hour ago if not for a much-whispered about destiny, which in a mythical world controlled by Gods is a decent delay tactic but in third millennium filmmaking is just flawed storytelling. In the end, the film becomes the same as its protagonist: a beautifully bloody empty shell, which is just enough for me."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Here is a brutally cold and punishing epic that is warmed only by the steam rising from disemboweled intestines – that is until a final showdown, where rivulets of lava lap at the ankles of men battling naked on the base of an active volcano, introduced by a title card labelled “The Gates of Hel.” And if that doesn’t sound punk and putrid enough, you can look at Willem Dafoe barking in a loincloth, Björk as a gnostic seeress, or a gravity-suspended horse galloping into the yoni of a cosmic Valhalla. This is what happens when you give a visionary director like Robert Eggers, obsessed with the myth and mania of folkloric legends, $90 million to make an epic about the ecstasy of revenge. How lucky we are. Co-written by Eggers and Icelandic poet Sjón, The Northman focuses on Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) and his single-minded pursuit of vengeance. After his scheming Uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) murders his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke, a stunning, short-lived performance), the young princeling disappears for twenty-odd years and returns as a hunk of manflesh: pure, terrifying brawn, a body of almost grotesque bulk, in which every sinew has been exercised in the pursuit of cold-blooded revenge. His one mission? To satiate the “freezing river of hate that runs through my veins.” His thirst for vengeance has become unyielding, caked thick into his psyche like the mud under his fingernails. All you can do is sit and be pummelled by the bloodbath of viscera on display. The kills come thick and fast, each one more inventive and gruesome than the last. Just as Amleth has “become a hailstorm of iron and steel,” Jarin Blaschke’s inky, ingenious cinematography casts the prince as though in stone, grimly set and serenely philosophical underneath his ironclad muscles. The film looks jaw-dropping: genuinely epic in scope while never failing to establish a sense of place among the fast-moving locations. Eggers and Sjón have taken what is ultimately a straightforward revenge plot and injected it with humour, eccentricity and rip-roaring verve. While other, nobler films often treat vengeance as something poisoned and futile, The Northman asks us: what if revenge was a satisfying, orgasmic triumph of sheer nirvana? The psychedelic intensity of the filmmaking is matched by the actors Eggers has assembled, with standouts including an unhinged Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún, whose (respectfully) unmoving face gives her an almost mad-eyed, plastic intensity, and Anya Taylor-Joy as an ethereal, husky-voiced native “of the Birch forest” who uses Earth magic to help Amleth on his path to revenge (after idyllic love-making in a twilit copse, naturally). And as the titular Northman, Alexander Skarsgård manages to emote through his blankness – no mean feat when we’re asked to view him as a “a hungry corpse returned from the grave,” a machine chiselled from ice. Eggers makes a spectacle out of masculinity, his wrathful men literally howling, roaring and grunting their emotions while the women make shrewd, clear-headed decisions around them. It is both gnarly and deeply funny; this is no self-serious, chin-stroking analysis of toxic masculinity, but a simulacrum of animals at the zoo, wallowing in filth and fighting to survive among life’s debilitating stench. The bear-pelt headdresses worn by the Vikings during their bone-crunching raids are not mere dressing, but a personal manifesto. Despite rumours of studio interference, this is a wonderfully weird and miraculous film; a buccaneering fever dream that somehow sees the director one-upping his first two features. Long may his feverishly strange spirit prevail."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Desde pequeño, Amleth sabía que su vida estaba destinada a la gloria. Un camino trazado por los dioses, quienes lo guiarían directamente hasta el Valhalla, el eterno paraíso de los grandes guerreros. Como único heredero del rey Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), y bajo la protección de Odín, su asenso al trono para gobernar un poderoso reino situado al norte del mar Atlántico era más que inminente. Sin embargo, una traición que emerge del núcleo familiar obliga al joven príncipe a huir de sus tierras y dejar atrás el legado construido por su padre. Al partir, el protagonista, enardecido, jura vengarse para reclamar su honor y salvar a su madre, la reina Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), de los siniestros planes orquestados por su tío Fjölnir (Claes Bang).  Años más tarde, la sed de venganza ha convertido a Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) en un animal salvaje que, junto a otros vikingos, recorre los territorios eslavos dejando una estela de destrucción y muerte. Tras saquear una pequeña aldea de forma brutal, el protagonista recibe una enigmática visión que le revela su destino y lo empuja a cumplir con la promesa que realizó al abandonar su reino. Dispuesto a defender el honor de su familia como un lobo, el guerrero se hace pasar por esclavo con tal de acercarse a su malvado tío y ganarse su confianza. Es así como éste, con la ayuda de Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), una valiente mujer que ha perdido todo en la vida, comienza a ejecutar los planes de su cruel y sanguinaria vendetta.  Basada en una popular leyenda nórdica, la cual supuestamente sirvió como inspiración para la obra Hamlet de William Shakespeare (el título es un anagrama del nombre del personaje principal: Amleth), The Northman (El Hombre del Norte) nos transporta hasta el siglo 10 para mostrarnos un relato de revancha que si bien resulta algo convencional en su desarrollo, sabe compensar sus fallos con un impresionante montaje que sobresale por su obsesivo apego histórico. Una película que tristemente nos enseña cómo, aún varios siglos después, la paz y la armonía de la humanidad continúa siendo amenazada por terribles actos de violencia sin justificación, perpetrados en nombre de unos cuantos que persiguen el poder y la grandeza prometida por falsas profecías.  Inspirado por los paisajes de Islandia, el visionario director norteamericano Robert Eggers, responsable de aclamados filmes como The VVitch y The Lighthouse, hace un salto del mundo del cine independiente al de los blockbusters con esta grandilocuente saga de vikingos. Su sello distintivo, la fiel recreación del estilo de vida de estos pueblos nórdicos, está presente a través de los 136 minutos de duración de la cinta, gracias al impecable diseño de producción y vestuario. Asimismo, el uso de luz natural como parte de la fotografía sirve para trasladarnos de manera efectiva a los tiempos de valquirias y demás deidades de la mitología escandinava.  No obstante, la mezcla de realismo y misticismo, una de las principales virtudes de los trabajos previos de Eggers, se encuentra en constante choque en The Northman. La fascinación del realizador por explorar el lado oscuro de mitos y leyendas se siente demasiado contenida y hasta saneada, quizá uno de los aspectos que se vieron comprometidos al colaborar por primera vez con un estudio cinematográfico. Se extraña el toque de ambigüedad e incomodidad con el que antiguos relatos de marineros y peregrinos americanos eran estudiados bajo un lente moderno. Aquí, lo raro es inmediatamente ofuscado por lo ordinario, dejándonos con una historia que raya en lo predecible y que arriesga poco. En cuestión actoral, la mayoría del elenco hace un trabajo formidable. A pesar de que Nicole Kidman consigue robarse un par de escenas gracias a su feroz interpretación, son Ethan Hawkes y Willem Dafoe quienes, pese a sus breves intervenciones, entienden la asignatura a la perfección y están en la misma sintonía de Eggers. Claes Bang y Anya Taylor-Joy ayudan a impulsar la parte emocional del arco narrativo del protagonista desde dos aristas distintas – odio y amor respectivamente – y cumplen con su labor. Por su parte, Alexander Skarsgård cautiva con una actuación visceral y física, aunque no del todo convincente en el aspecto introspectivo, elemento necesario para conectar en un plano más íntimo con el conflicto de su personaje.  The Northman es un espectáculo visual de gran escala, de esos que se aprecian mejor en una sala oscura de cine con una pantalla gigante y sonido envolvente. Sin embargo, como épica, este violento relato de honor, venganza y mucha testosterona decepciona al recorrer los mismos caminos que otros héroes han seguido en ocasiones previas. Asimismo, las hazañas de Amleth terminan por romantizarse e idealizarse, pese al intento por subvertir el significado de las imágenes mitológicas como un absurdo justificante de masculinidad tóxica y violencia que, hasta la fecha, continúa siendo utilizado por algunos como excusa para defender crímenes cometidos contra de la humanidad."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"None of the players should be blamed for the uneven historical canvas or the unnecessary length of some scenes. Regardless, if anyone really is looking to be entertained by stories of this ilk, I suggest a 1958 spectacle simply called 'The Vikings.'"
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," It might be his most accessible film to date, but Robert Eggers doesn’t compromise his vision in The Northman, nor settle for the trappings of a mainstream crowd-pleaser. Instead, this visually striking and brutally violent battle epic unspools a visceral exploration of primal instincts and toxic masculinity that’s set in the 10th century but still resonates today. Deliberately paced, it rewards patience for moviegoers willing to indulge Eggers (The Lighthouse) his eccentricities while penetrating some obscure Norse mythology and thick nonspecific accents. As a child, Amleth (Oscar Novak) grew up as the heir to Viking king Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), only to see him murdered by a vengeful uncle, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), who desires both power and companionship in the form of Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). The traumatized prince flees the kingdom, returning years later with pent-up rage. Morphed into a fighter equally adept wielding a hatchet or sword, the grown-up Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) sneaks aboard a slave ship bound for the remote land where Fjolnir took his mother against her will. After meeting a wayward young woman (Anja Taylor-Joy) who helps him gain access to his target and learning of a magical weapon to do the deed, Amleth’s plan is complicated by ulterior motives and conflicted loyalties. Any film by Eggers requires audacious and fully committed performances by actors willing to challenge themselves physically and emotionally. In this case, an intensely expressive portrayal by Skarsgard (The Legend of Tarzan) provides invigorating texture as our resilient and determined warrior hero. The stilted screenplay by Eggers and Icelandic author Sjon (Lamb) is a blood-soaked revenge saga with Shakespearean ambitions — and some supernatural dabbling — in which Amleth struggles to find his sense of humanity after being cursed as a self-proclaimed beast. The movie sometimes has the same problem. Not for the squeamish, the film’s relentless savagery tends to create a numbing sense of emotional ambivalence. At its core, this rather straightforward tale of honor and betrayal is richly detailed without yielding much deeper historical context. However, The Northman is a sturdy fantasy adventure rendered with style and sophistication, plus some clever twists preceding the inevitable showdown in the captivating final act. The resulting game of thrones is both exhausting and exhilarating."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL," The medieval Viking legend of Amleth, the inspiration for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” becomes a dark big screen extravaganza in “The Northman.” Alexander Skarsgård takes the title role of a prince who spends years seeking revenge on his uncle who killed his father, married his mother, and stole his kingdom. Director Robert Eggers lacks Shakespeare’s depth and poetry but ups the ante on grisly violence and mythological spectacle. Visually, it’s absolutely stunning, but the sullen tone of “The Northman” makes it a bleak, one-note opus. The wildly imaginative movie “Everything Everywhere All at Once” may have the most appropriate title possible. Difficult to categorize, it’s an R-rated sci-fi martial arts action arthouse comedy with overtones of romance and heartfelt family dynamics. Written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Schienert, collectively called “The Daniels,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once” stars Michelle Yeoh as a harried coin laundry proprietor who is just trying to get her taxes done. She and her family are sucked into a conflict, and they contend with multiple versions of themselves as they try to save the multiverse from a destructive entity. One could argue that it goes too far, but it’s funny, highly original, and philosophically thought-provoking. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” is a masterfully edited and downright wacky viewing experience. If Cartoon Network tried to make “Ocean’s 11,” it might look a bit like “The Bad Guys.” Sam Rockwell and Zazie Beetz lead a talented voice cast in this funny, manic animated comedy that advocates the notion that criminals are just misguided and in need of direction. While it doesn’t approach the depth of Pixar’s work, “The Bad Guys” is still an affable family-friendly diversion."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Franchise action films are in love with justice. “James Bond,” “Superman,” “Iron Man,” “Harry Potter” and even “Ghostbusters” go out of their way to let you know that the people onscreen aren’t just shooting, hitting or blasting each other for fun. They are shooting, hitting or blasting each other for good. The special effects and choreography are anchored to a morality tale that justifies excesses of violence and lots of explosions. Robert Eggers’ historical action epic “The Northman” is resolutely, and gloriously, uninterested in justice or in setting things right. Based on the same Danish legend that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” the film is a tale of revenge and blood for its own sake, which forcefully puts a sharpened axe through any moral catharsis. Like the ravens that occasionally flap across the screen, viewers aren’t there to witness the triumph of heroism. They’re there to feast on the carrion. The revenge-plot swings back and forth as efficiently as a scythe. In the 800s A.D., King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also seizes and marries Aurvandill’s queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Aurvandill’s son, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) escapes, and swears to revenge his father, save his mother and kill Fjölnir. After some years working as a mercenary, Amleth joins a Rus raiding party that destroys a village and enslaves the inhabitants. He finds out the captives are destined for Fjölnir, who was driven from his home by the king of Norway and now lives in reduced circumstances in Iceland. Amleth disguises himself as a slave and plots to murder Fjölnir with the help of a fellow slave, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and the requisite magic sword. We see Amleth’s horror as a child when Fjölnir kills his father; viewers are likely to be on his side. But Eggers makes sure it’s clear that Amleth’s isn’t the right side. The scene in which he raids the village is a ravishly filmed panorama of war crimes: prisoners killed, women and children murdered, prisoners burned alive. Amleth participates without any apparent qualm. The fight choreography is brutal, animalistic and efficient; Amleth cuts a swath through opponents who are obviously less well trained and are just trying to defend their families. He tears out one poor man’s throat with his teeth. Nor is Fjölnir a caricature villain. Yes, he enslaves people, murders with impunity and tries to rape Olga. He’s a bad person. But he obviously cares for his wife and for his children. Both he and Amleth are brutal, vicious men who take what they want and deal out bloody violence to those who stand in their way. That spectacle of carnage is the purpose of the film, and Eggers knows that viewers know it. Amleth is bound by fate. He must fulfill his revenge plot so that he can die in battle and enter the hall of Odin, as a number of seers (most notably one played by Björk) tell him. Is that a fanciful pagan notion? Or is it the logic of the action/revenge film? For Eggers, it’s the same thing; the old cycle of violence and the new cycle of violence are caught in the same giant world tree that haunts Amleth’s visions. The movie could easily end an hour in, if Amleth just killed Fjölnir as soon as he arrived on the farm. But, as he tells Olga, it’s not time yet; he’s got to keep following fate, or the plot. A bit further on, when Fjölnir captures him and beats him, Amleth tells his uncle confidently that he cannot be killed yet because it’s not time. That sounds like a mystical prediction. But it could also just be the star of a film checking his watch, and figuring out that the run time isn’t finished. Amleth does waver at points. He wonders if hate is really the only path, or whether he can turn aside for love. But ultimately fear chains him to his destiny. He worries that Fjölnir will never let him be, so back to destiny he goes — though the decision was never really in doubt. An action movie has to have a climactic battle. And this one, set astride a volcanic fissure, very much delivers. Before he goes on a raid, Amleth performs an animalistic ritual — growling and declaring that he has cast off his human traits to become a bear or a wolf. Conscience, compassion, kindness are set aside for the crack of skulls. Amleth doesn’t pretend to be righteous. He pretends so he doesn’t have to think about righteousness at all. Eggers offers his viewers a similar experience of amorality. This isn’t a superhero flick where the conceit is that every mega-explosion saves another baby. The immense, desaturated vistas, stark and open, don’t afford much hiding place for hypocrisy or self-deception. “The Northman” offers elaborately staged hatred and death. It was popular then; it’s popular now."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Before you rush out to see “The Northman,” the new epic about Icelandic Vikings, which is playing at your favorite movie theater, you might want to catch up on the history and lore of those Scandinavian adventurers of the sea and conquerors of quite a lot of European territory as seen in previous films. Those of you with children at home are probably already feeling the pressure of taking them along. Here are ten titles for your entertainment enjoyment that will give you a sense of what it was like to live during the era of the Vikings, even if most are not fully historically accurate. In some instances, I’ve named a star or two who might attract your interest. I’ve ranked them in order of how jam-packed they are with Scandinavian lore and how well they offer a general understanding of the Vikings. From tenth to first: “Eric The Viking” (a 1989 comedy from Terry Jones of Monty Python), “Eric The Conqueror” (1961), “Outlander” (2008), “The Long Ships” (Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, 1964), “Thor” (2011; from Marvel), “The Last King” (2016; from Norway), “The 13th Warrior” (1999; with Antonio Banderas), “Beowulf” (2007; live-action, but the actors are literally draped in CGI), “Valhalla Rising” (2009; with Mads Mikkelsen), and “The Vikings” (1958; with Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, and Janet Leigh). All of the movies are available through streaming and some are on DVD and Blu-ray. An interesting aspect of making a film about Vikings is that the production team really doesn’t have to pay steep rights fees. Toss in some reddish beards, shiny swords, furry costumes, sailing ships that look like dragons, and a touch of mysticism from a prophet, and you’ve got yourself a movie. However, to make it worth anyone’s time to see Vikings in a new light, you’ve got to have an imaginative director and a good screenwriter. Fortunately with “The Northman,” the director is the American Robert Eggers, who, based on his two previous features: “The Witches” and “The Lighthouse,” definitely seems like a fearless guy. Eggers co-wrote the screenplay for “The Northman” with Sigurjon Birgir Sigurosson, a poet, novelist, and lyricist from Iceland, who writes under the single name Sjon. He’s a frequent collaborator with the Icelandic singer Bjork, who plays a seeress in Eggers violence-filled retelling of the Dark Ages. Sjon’s most recent produced screenplay was for the robustly bizarre horror film, “Lamb” from 2021. “The Northman” is loosely based on William Shakespeare’s play about that melancholy Dane, Hamlet, which itself was based by the Bard on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which is an anagram for Hamlet. The film’s central character is named Amleth. After a raven swoops into our on-screen consciousness, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns wounded from another war. In due time, he will be murdered by his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang), who also kidnaps Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). The killing of the King is in retaliation for the fact that he has begun to train his young son Amleth for leadership with curious bonding rituals. The boy witnesses his father’s death and flees. Time jumps forward and Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgard) is a warrior in his own right, slaughtering as many people on the European continent as he and his Viking hordes can kill. Blood flows like the mighty Niagara. In one particularly gruesome scene, villagers are chopped to pieces or burned alive. The joyful shouts from Viking swordsmen and the wailing of the dying innocents are psychological jolts to the audience. If you think you’ve heard the sounds of madness before, you really haven’t until you’ve heard them coming from victims writhing on blood-soaked land where calm once reigned. You are watching total brutality in a time when total brutality truly meant the measure of a man. Sex is also a weapon. Amleth falls hard for the beautiful Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic girl who is a sorceress, and he takes her with him. Amleth is not quite a caveman; therefore, he understands the necessity of avoiding being put under a spell, but he does have his needs. However, as would be expected in a tale borrowed from “Hamlet,” Amleth is moody. In fact, yes I’ll write it again, he’s melancholy. Amleth has already decided that he needs to be more selective about whom he kills. Marauding and murder must have deeper meaning. He becomes obsessed with a fierce desire to avenge his father’s death and rescue his mother. The main thrust of “The Northman” is that strapping young Amleth, whose good looks seem divined by the Gods, creates a mission for himself. Fjolnir should prepare himself for the ultimate darkness. Amleth begins the journey to exact revenge. “The Northman” follows the breadth of savagery in savage lands. There’s no escaping the pall of terror it reveals. Eggers is a master at blending psychology and cinema. He plays mind games with his most assuredly cowering audience. If there is a problem with the riveting film, it’s that repetition creeps in. The picture’s 137-minute length isn’t warranted, but it isn’t oppressive, unless, that is, gore overwhelms you. The production budget of $90-million isn’t particularly large; however, the movie looks spectacular thanks to Jarin Blaschke’s supremely alluring cinematography. Louise Ford’s film editing is on a continually breathtaking razor’s edge. As for the children you know who want to see “The Northman,” I’m drawing the line at 16-years-old and over. Let the other kids choose from my list above. Or, they can watch the animated “How To Train Your Dragon” and it's sequel, part 2 (from 2010 and 2014, respectively). There are plenty of satisfying Viking legends in both of them. “The Northman” is something unique these days, a movie that isn’t afraid to be relentless in its strangeness. It demands to be seen because it’s so startlingly original.

"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Tale as old as time, song as old as the decayed drum-skins on which it’s all been written, Robert Eggers’ bloody brutal and beautiful The Northman casts all twenty-tall and five-wide feet of the Scandinavian god-man Alexander Skarsgård to play the Viking to end all Vikings in the Hamlet tale to end all Hamlet tales. Yes, they come from the land of the ice and snow, from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow, but most especially they are thirsty for the red sticky stuff of vengeance, sweet old-school skull-smashing throat-gurgling vengeance. And The Northman sails on a longship bellied upon a boiling sea of it. Visually gargantuan, thrumming with strange noise and even stranger visions, this is not even your grand-daddy’s grand-daddy’s Shakespeare—this is the bastard child of George Miller’s Mad Max Fury Road and Darren Aronofsky’s The Fountain, a surreal-tinged outer-space-operatic spectacle of every gray in the rainbow, speaking both morally and pigmentally. The Northman feels beamed in from another galaxy, in all the perfect sense. And if I also tell you right up front that this is Robert Eggers’ third best movie out of his three-so-far movies (following his two previous masterpieces The Witch and The Lighthouse) then what of it? It’s still for long stretches unlike anything you’ve ever seen on a movie screen. What The Northman’s sort-of-straightforward script lacks in surprise, hitting as it does all of the same notes struck by ye Bard’s olde Danish Prince tale four hundred years thence—uncle kills brother, son hunts uncle, wash and repeat until everything’s bloody—Eggers’ monumental visual sense muddies up that familiarity with heavy metal depravity, with Bjork in big shell hats, with decapitated horses and nighttime skies so thick with stars that every character starts to resemble less a person than they do a walking talking constellation of lights. Which is to say that you probably will not mistake Prince Amleth (Skarsgård), his battle-scarred father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), his steel-eyed fire-haired mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), or his bastard uncle Claes Bang as “Fjölnir the Brotherless” (looking like Scar and speaking like Mustafa), for real people. To call them “larger than life” archetypes is to make a mole-hill of several mountains-the massive Icelandic scenery, halfway high to Valhalla itself, simply gets in the way of these folks’ machinations, and so they elbow the fjords and the roiling seas out of their way when they see fit to it. Everything in The Northman bellows-the ocean, the sky, the birds, the bosoms. The score, noodled out on ancient Nordic instruments by first-time soundtrack-makers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, is a percussion-heavy hut-burner, subbing out Mad Max’s fire-blasting electric guitars with obscure Icelandic zithers while losing none of that same gut-quaking, skin-scorching fury. In the 1950s this movie would have starred Steve Reeves and it would have been taken far less seriously, and (Harryhausen theatrics aside) all the worse for us that would have been — I truly love that now, unlike the ’50s when these efforts were seen as jokey and cheap, we live in a time and place where we can see and appreciate that serious artists devoted real craft and effort and immense skill into transporting us not just to another time, but toward another completely alien mindset altogether. People one thousand years ago weren’t working from the same reference points that we take for granted today, and a scholarly filmmaker like Robert Eggers is vital in actually getting that across — you can see it in all of The Northman’s references to Christianity as a vulgar aberration (those people worship a corpse nailed to a piece of wood!), and in its tangled intestine fortune-telling and ritualized blood sacrifice.  And Eggers’ devotion to the most minute period specificity isn’t just an O.C.D. tic; there’s method to his madness. When you spend time inside his movies that madness seeps into your eyes, your heart, your soul, as you find yourself lost amid foreign symbols and scribbled tongues. We aren’t watching a Valkyrie screech across the heavens for sheer sport and spectacle (although hell yeah it’s that too) — this was how Amleth and his kinfolk believed, how they saw the world. And The Northman goes full gangbusters in its efforts at cramming those ancient eyeballs into our scooped-out sockets, all the best to make us see their way if only for an instant of true movie-bliss Nirvana. Talk about a time-machine — Robert Eggers’ broad sword slices history in half and shoves our faces straight into its steaming belly. So Amleth’s quest takes him from boyhood tragedy to foreign marauder-Eggers thankfully doesn’t romanticize the horrors the Vikings were responsible for, at one point actually summoning up a moment from Elem Klimov’s anti-war nightmare masterpiece Come and See of all things to cast an unforgiving eye on top of its single-take cinematic spectacle of blood and fury, as we watch the Vikings ravage a small village. There are several shots of the “how in the hell did he do that” variety that basically demand fist-to-table a return to the big-screen movie theater, if safe for you, in order to see them writ as large as they proffer, and marvel. Eggers’ camera-work, so smart and snake-like in its movements, was built for an epic story like this, giving us full view of everything, the broad expanse of the battlefield and the smallest deadliest wounds held in excruciating close-up. As Amleth closes in on his father’s murderer and his shoulders spread by leaps and bounds he slips himself into slavery, into fox-cunning chaos-bringer, and into some romance too (Eggers’ fave Anya Taylor-Joy could have used a little more to do as “Olga of the Birch Forest” but she remains a special effect all on her own, and you will believe her when she summons the winds) — all while the volcano at the horizon grows redder, angrier, Earth’s greatest pimple ready to blow its lid. Everybody brings their A-game to this very B-story, bless them — Nicole Kidman and Claes Bang fare especially well in the film’s last act as the arterial sprays start painting their under-eyes and their declarations grow into ever-grander, nakeder screams. They wear madness wonderfully, and Skarsgard, bounds weirder than Steve Reeves would ever manage, cuts one memorable anti-hero figure through its middle. So no, The Northman might not represent the delicious scallywag rejection of mainstream storytelling that Eggers perfected with The Lighthouse. But it’s still speaking a language, one of brimstone and sulphur and cawing incandescent birds, that feels distant enough from our own that it sparks and sizzles with absolute ingenuity, with a richness most movies never come close to. The Northman, in another tongue, is pure fire."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Mythology and folklore of the distant past are usually not only a gaze into civilizations long gone, but a look into how old stories affect our current world. When showcased effectively in modern entertainment, they can take on relevancy that goes beyond the historical. The new Viking-themed movie saga The Northman is a film steeped in Icelandic folklore and history. There are so many references and allusions to greater tales interwoven within the movie. It is a wild scenic ride that can be enjoyable if taken at surface level. The problem that comes into play is that there’s so much more below that surface that feels almost locked away behind a fortress of sparse dialogue and explanation. The Northman, sadly, isn’t as inviting as it needs to be for viewers wanting to explore the world the film presents to them.
Starring Alexander Skarsgård (Passing), Nicole Kidman (Being the Ricardos), Claes Bang (Locked Down), Anya Taylor-Joy (Last Night in Soho), and Ethan Hawke (The Guilty), The Northman is written and directed by Robert Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sjón. The movie is based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, who is a direct inspiration for the character of Hamlet in William Shakespeare’s tragedy, Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.
It is a story about betrayal and revenge, as Skarsgård’s character Amleth aims to avenge the death of his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven. The film follows Amleth from the time of being a young boy as he grows into a fierce Viking warrior who aims to kill his father’s murderer and reclaim what was lost. Yet, twists, turns, revelations, and romance along the way complicate Amleth’s lust for revenge.
The beauty and the brutality are a near perfect blend in The Northman. The atmosphere, the landscape, and the action come together to fully immerse the viewer in the story. Even the scenes of extreme violence are masterfully done, making one squirm in their seat yet leaving them unable to turn away from the screen. Unfortunately, in modern times, it feels as though the idea of Vikings has been boiled down to become synonymous with plunder and assault. In less capable hands, a tale such as this one could have devolved into an over-the-top version of exactly that. Eggers takes a different approach—one that pays off in a number of ways.
Characters are given a complexity that would have otherwise been buried in violence and gore. Battle scenes and death are important to the plot and given significance instead of just placed in simply for the sake of being there. So when people are stabbed, decapitated, or injured, it resonates more, rather than forcing the audience to become desensitized to it because they are overwhelmed by it. This also holds true for the plight of the women characters in the movie.
Another issue when dealing with stories concerning the Vikings, or tales from the time of the ninth through the eleventh century, is that women had it rough (rough being an understatement). The pillaging and colonizing of towns and villages far too often included the rape, assault, and abduction of the women of these areas—women were part of the conquest.
When going into films that deal with these times in history, one almost expects a way-too-graphic scene of something like this taking place. This critic feels that one too many filmmakers take the easy way out in depicting these moments in a way that almost feels exploitative rather than adding to the storytelling. I am happy to report that Eggers does not fall into this trap.
Instead, he allows the trauma and ramifications of those hardships to be alluded to and manifested in more effective storytelling ways. The women characters are made important to the story beyond just their relationships with the men, displaying their understanding of themselves and what they want, for better or worse.
And yet, even with these hints at complexity, The Northman almost feels like a guarded tale that isn’t welcoming to those new to the mythos it explores. Confusing wouldn’t be the right word to describe the film. The overarching plot is actually very straightforward. The boy’s father is killed, the boy flees so as to not be killed himself, and the boy returns years later in disguise to avenge his father. That much is evident and easy to follow. Rather, it is clear that there are many references in the movie regarding the world The Northman belongs in, but the surface is only scratched. The occult, the magic, and the historic figures are there, but without the proper space in the story for the audience to appreciate them, they get lost in the simpler tale.
Nicole Kidman in ‘The Northman.’
We needed more of Taylor-Joy’s Slavic witch and the power that was hinted at in her character. We needed more of Kidman’s complex Queen Gudrún and the thoughts behind the decisions she made. Both Taylor-Joy and Kidman give knockout performances that nearly steal every scene they are in. Both characters are so compelling that this critic would gladly welcome two spin-off films following their characters’ lives and adventures.
Perhaps full exploration would have made the movie much longer than its already two hours and 16 minutes running time. But because of this, viewers may dismiss the film as just an action movie set in the past. They may feel the intensity but not recognize that it’s due to more than just the blood and the gore on screen. This is a solid movie, make no mistake of that, but the full potential it could have embodied almost feels like an opportunity missed.
If you’re looking for a film that explores Viking lore in a different, more nuanced way, while maintaining the action, then this movie is for you. It doesn’t go as deep as it could have, but if nothing else, it may inspire many viewers to look further into the history of the culture it depicts.

Battle scenes and death are important to the plot and given significance instead of just placed in simply for the sake of being there. So when people are stabbed, decapitated, or injured, it resonates more, rather than forcing the audience to become desensitized to it because they are overwhelmed by it. This also holds true for the plight of the women characters in the movie. Another issue when dealing with stories concerning the Vikings, or tales from the time of the ninth through the eleventh century, is that women had it rough (rough being an understatement). The pillaging and colonizing of towns and villages far too often included the rape, assault, and abduction of the women of these areas—women were part of the conquest. When going into films that deal with these times in history, one almost expects a way-too-graphic scene of something like this taking place. This critic feels that one too many filmmakers take the easy way out in depicting these moments in a way that almost feels exploitative rather than adding to the storytelling. I am happy to report that Eggers does not fall into this trap. Instead, he allows the trauma and ramifications of those hardships to be alluded to and manifested in more effective storytelling ways. The women characters are made important to the story beyond just their relationships with the men, displaying their understanding of themselves and what they want, for better or worse. And yet, even with these hints at complexity, The Northman almost feels like a guarded tale that isn’t welcoming to those new to the mythos it explores. Confusing wouldn’t be the right word to describe the film. The overarching plot is actually very straightforward. The boy’s father is killed, the boy flees so as to not be killed himself, and the boy returns years later in disguise to avenge his father. That much is evident and easy to follow. Rather, it is clear that there are many references in the movie regarding the world The Northman belongs in, but the surface is only scratched. The occult, the magic, and the historic figures are there, but without the proper space in the story for the audience to appreciate them, they get lost in the simpler tale. We needed more of Taylor-Joy’s Slavic witch and the power that was hinted at in her character. We needed more of Kidman’s complex Queen Gudrún and the thoughts behind the decisions she made. Both Taylor-Joy and Kidman give knockout performances that nearly steal every scene they are in. Both characters are so compelling that this critic would gladly welcome two spin-off films following their characters’ lives and adventures. Perhaps full exploration would have made the movie much longer than its already two hours and 16 minutes running time. But because of this, viewers may dismiss the film as just an action movie set in the past. They may feel the intensity but not recognize that it’s due to more than just the blood and the gore on screen. This is a solid movie, make no mistake of that, but the full potential it could have embodied almost feels like an opportunity missed. If you’re looking for a film that explores Viking lore in a different, more nuanced way, while maintaining the action, then this movie is for you. It doesn’t go as deep as it could have, but if nothing else, it may inspire many viewers to look further into the history of the culture it depicts. Chauncey K.

"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," It was vigorously demonstrated in his first two features – The Witch (2015), a gruesomely persuasive tale about the workings of black magic on a family of puritans in 17th century New England, and The Lighthouse (2019), which puts Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in a lighthouse on a wintry stretch of the Nova Scotia coast and has them set about driving one another crazy. His new film, The Northman, is his biggest yet. It’s a 10th century Viking saga starring a bulked-up Alexander Skarsgard as Amleth, the Nordic warrior whose revenge legend was Shakespeare’s inspiration for Hamlet. But don’t expect any of Hamlet’s doubting and dithering. At the age of nine, Amleth watches his father being butchered by his brother and barely manages to escape with his life. From that moment, he’s obsessed with the need to see his uncle die as painfully as possible. He survives by finding a handy rowing boat and fetching up among a ferocious but understanding tribe who ensure that he acquires all the skills necessary for reaching adulthood. He can run, jump and hack somebody to death with a single stroke of his broadsword. What more can you ask? As it happens, he does need one more attribute, and it doesn’t come easily. He is forced to become acquainted with patience as well as having to feign humility since his only way of getting to his uncle, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), is to become a slave. Having lost his throne during an enemy invasion, Fjolnir is living as a sheep farmer with Amleth’s mother, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), now his wife, in Iceland and a shipment of slaves is heading his way. Movies set in the ancient world are always at risk of parody. There’s something about the air of solemnity that so often envelops the past that makes ridicule irresistible. Game of Thrones got around the problem with the cleverness of the intrigues animating its plots and its almost casual attitude to the brutality that went with them. They left you too shocked to laugh. Eggers’ films work differently. He has no time for caustic dialogue or devious politicking. But he does share Game of Thrones′ interest in the part played by the supernatural in the lives of the ancients. Amleth, for example, has been raised in the belief that his spirit animals are the wolf and the bear, which entails a lot of grunting and howling at the moon. And it’s a measure of Eggers’ skill that he makes this work to hallucinogenic effect with little more than sinister lighting and a nerve-racking soundtrack. He even manages to have you accept Bjork as a prophetess kitted out in a dazzling array of ethnic finery. Yet, this is a film which takes itself so seriously that I couldn’t subdue the temptation to look for slip-ups. At one point, Amleth and his love interest, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) suddenly appear spruced up to a standard suggesting a lightning visit to some trendy outfitter in sustainable textiles. But it’s a rare moment. The measure of Eggers’ standing as a director can be seen in the film’s casting. Bjork is said to have come out of her retirement from acting to make her brief appearance while Willem Dafoe has a similarly short speech as a jester at the court of Amleth’s father. It’s an impressive piece of time travel. Eggers succeeds in conjuring up a world governed exclusively by blood feuds and territorial imperatives. And Skarsgard, who helps initiate the production, makes a magnificently realised Amleth. You can read the strength of his obsession in every muscle. He and Eggers are made for one another. But be warned: they expect the same unwavering passion from their audience."
"Apr 23, 2022",NEUTRAL," Robert Eggers has made his mark on the filmmaking industry. Having been impressed with his feature films The Witch and The Lighthouse, I certainly consider myself a fan of his work. Eggers’ sense of storytelling traditionally fosters a haunting and tantalizing nature to it. His films have garnered not only the attention of niche horror fans, but have even slowly crept their way into mainstream consciousness, with their ominous tone and striking finales becoming bona fide hallmarks of Eggers’ filmmaking style and riveting topics for conversation. I say all of this to set the expectation for Eggers fans that in many ways, The Northman is a beast of a different nature, so to speak. Aesthetically, Eggers’ devotion to detailed world building is present. Narratively and thematically, however, Eggers’ grasp exceeds his reach with The Northman, where chilling, under-your-skin storytelling takes a back seat to visual appeal. Though the film narrowly avoids being a contrived blockbuster, it still is not refined enough to exhibit the kind of storytelling prowess that Eggers is capable of. The Northman begins at a coastal village with the film’s main character, Amleth (Oscar Novek), as a young, coming of age boy aspiring to be like his brave, honor-driven father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). But when Amleth witnesses the brutal betrayed and murdered of his father by Aurvandill’s brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), Amleth flees the overtaken kingdom, vowing to save his mother (played by Nicole Kidman), avenge his father, and kill Fjölnir. Years later as a grown man and trained warrior (played by Alexander Skarsgård), he pursues this vengeance. Posing as a slave, he returns to his community, which had been forced to take refuge on Icelandic hillsides in his absence. With the help of mystic powers and another slave in the settlement, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), he secretly terrorizes the village as he waits for the right opportunity to reveal his identity and kill his uncle. As with Eggers’ previous two films, The Northman is a supremely immersive cinematic experience. However, the film suffers from perhaps being too big in scope. Eggers’ storytelling, after all, is best when it remains in one setting - The Witch primarily taking place around a remote family’s dwelling, and The Lighthouse on a small barren island. In line with this trend, The Northman is most engrossing when it’s sequences are settled in one place - whether that be in the opening act experiencing Amleth’s culture and coming-of-age rituals, or in the chapters where he has returned to the new settlement to terrorize it. Taking his journey from one place, to another, to another over indiscernible amounts of time trades Eggers' more keen sense of storytelling for convoluted meandering. On a technical level, however, there’s much to appreciate about The Northman. Performances from its leading cast, including Skarsgård who wears an overexaggerated posture for much of the film, keep the film engaging, even when the motivations of these characters are less than compelling. And the camera work is noteworthy, offering a creative eye on scenes that include long takes and even a one-take style action sequence. But is this why you showed up for The Northman? Is camerawork what you’re trying to pay attention to? Thought-provoking storylines? Did you come to experience the next step in the evolution of Eggers’ filmmaking? Probably not. While these things may inspire cinephiles to see Eggers’ new “The Insert-Relevant-Noun-Here” films, the target audience for The Northman is here simply for the promise of violence and viking antics, and to that end, mainstream viewers will most likely be content with what it has to offer. Combat is well choreographed and works in conjunction with longer takes. And action sequences are coated with a glossy video game-like sheen, often exhibiting RPG qualities. All of this can work in the film's benefit or to its detriment, depending on who you ask. For me, The Northman - lavish as it might be with set designs, costume designs, and brutality - represents a step away from the type of filmmaking I appreciate from Eggers. There is an overt attempt here to regard this film as a summer blockbuster, but the blessings of a bigger budget for a bigger story come part and parcel with the curse of mass market appeasement. Is The Northman entertaining? For most, yes. But does it capture that tension and vexing dread and foreboding that Eggers has so masterfully honed in his work? Not often enough, rendering the journey of the Northman, in my humble opinion, unfortunately futile.

"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," Revenge is a tale as old as time and often a dish best served cold. So it certainly makes sense that Robert Eggers new film The Northman is filmed in the land of the Vikings. A bold retelling of the legend of Amleth (the inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet), the film centers on on Prince Amleth and his quest for revenge after he witnesses his father’s murder at the hands of his uncle. Robert Eggers has established himself as a master of mood and tone since he dragged us by our eyebrows with The VVitch. Here, he’s working with a much broader canvas and a sizable budget, and acquits himself astoundingly well. This is one of the most well directed movies of the year so far, and his understanding of composition and storytelling helps take what is a very simple story to immense heights. I was dazzled by the imagery but also in how he maintains tension and directs the performances. But it’s not just Eggers who is at the top of his game, the movie is a complete production, with not a single element failing the film. Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography calls to mind The Revenant for it’s beautiful, brutal realism, but goes beyond to feel more lived in. The sound department and composers compliment the visuals with some really fascinating sound design choices and a mix of score and sound that bother heightened the drama as well as laid the foundation for the action oriented scenes. I was lucky enough to see this in Dolby Atmos and I’d encourage you to run to see it in the best theater you can. Alexander Skarsgård has always been able to use his physical presence in his roles in very interesting ways. Here in The Northman, he’s not just the biggest person in the cast but literally the largest man, on which the movie rests of his very large shoulders. That physicality lends itself well to action, but also to characterization, as Skarsgård finds new ways into the character simply by holding himself in a different way. But lest you think he’s just a hulking mass of revenge, he is able seamlessly weave in his character’s inner struggle and psychological motivations. It’s very fascinating to watch. The supporting cast is filled with a mix of strong character work, led namely by Anya Taylor-Joy and Claes Bang. As the lover and uncle, respectively, both represent opposing forces in Amleth’s life. I loved what both of those actors brought to the table. There’s really one glaring problem with the movie and that’s in the back half. Due to the single minded nature of the quest, the movie struggles to make it to its climax without a few bumps in the road. While the narrative decisions all make sense, there comes a point in the film where it sort of needs to reach a natural conclusion and the script by Eggers and Sjón can’t quite get there as seamlessly as they would like. But thankfully for audiences, the movie rights itself just when it needs to, delivering a satisfying conclusion to this epic tale."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," While it’s not a home run, it is still a very memorable experience – a sweeping bloody epic with hints of “Beowulf” and “Oedipus Rex” brought to life by Eggers’ visual flair. When the film begins, Amleth is a young boy happily welcoming back his father the king (Ethan Hawke) from battle. But the kingdom is soon threatened from within as the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) stages a bloody coup to take the crown. Amleth escapes but vows to return one day to get revenge for his father and save his mother (Nicole Kidman) from the grasps of his uncle. Years later, Amleth returns disguised as a slave, enlisting the help from a young woman named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). Eggers co-wrote the film with Sjón, who penned last year’s bizarre horror film “Lamb.” You can see influences of both writers’ previous work in “Northman” with crisp storytelling – a tale of revenge that may be familiar but feels fresh here. The story works well with Eggers’ direction, which takes his trademark visual style and pushes it to new heights with some very ambitious sequences that bring an epic feel. Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography is stunning, with some incredible looking moments and some superb production design that really brings it all to life in a thrilling manner. Skarsgård is fabulous and quite convincing as the film’s antagonist, bringing the right tone of pent-up anger needed to make this character relatable. Kidman has fun in her role, and Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself as one of her generation’s best actresses. I will concede that “The Northman” might not be for everyone – a film that basks in the brutal bloodshed and old-school storytelling. Still, I was enthralled by the action throughout – a fan of the action of the whole vibe of the film. If you are fan of old-school epic tales of revenge, then “The Northman” is the movie for you. It’s a cinematic throwback that is a step forward for Eggers."
"Apr 23, 2022",POSITIVE," In his first film, The Witch, piety and religious dogma separate the film’s central family from the rest of their community and stoke fearful infighting as their situation progresses from bad to worse.  Eggers’ new historical epic The Northman is grander in scope than his two previous, more contained films, but also looks at ideas of religion, legend, and masculinity through their potential to empower and destroy.  It does so against a gorgeous, practically operatic backdrop that again shines a spotlight on Eggers’ production design background. The Northman won’t change your mind if you know you dislike Eggers’ anthropological storytelling proclivities.  The Northman tells us the story of Viking prince Amleth (played in childhood by Oscar Novak), who witnesses the death of his beloved father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth narrowly escapes his own death, promising to return one day to avenge his father, kill his uncle, and save his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) from his clutches.  After learning the villagers he’s just enslaved are headed to Fjölnir, Amleth travels with them to infiltrate his uncle’s home and exact his revenge. He’s aided by fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and empowered by the prophecy of a seeress (Björk). Amleth’s story is illustrated with painterly cinematography from frequent Eggers collaborator Jarin Blaschke, using natural landscapes and surreal dream imagery in ways that express the culture Eggers profiles and the inner journey of Amleth as he reckons with his perceived destiny. Most of the movie’s individual frames wouldn’t look out of place in a gallery. Those evocative visuals are accompanied by a script that complicates an otherwise straightforward revenge narrative. The Northman does this by considering the larger impact a culture obsessed with honor, masculinity, and physical dominance (*coughs in patriarchy*) has on those being dominated.  As the people around Amleth, his berserker brothers-in-arms and his family become increasingly hurt by power changes, or by Amleth himself, it becomes increasingly difficult to see him as the hero.  Of the characters Amleth is trying to either kill or rescue, Kidman’s Gudrún, who navigates two marriages to temperamental men in Aurvandil and Fjölnir, becomes The Northman’s most interesting figure.  Kidman imbues her with confidence and intelligence, allowing a highly specific look into the way someone in her position would view herself and her choices. That plays in stark contrast to the way she’s considered by Amleth, as a pure, powerless figure in need of saving.  The Northman contains plenty of bloody action and strange magical realism but approaches that content with a much more cerebral, critical point of view. It’s a perspective that feels in line with movies like last year’s The Green Knight, or the bizarro Excalibur-era output of John Boorman.  At nearly two and a half hours, that may be a lot to ask for anyone hoping for a straightforward thriller, but for those willing to get invested, there’s significant treasure in store. "
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Characters are mainly seeking violence and revenge and ways to usurp power or gain control over others. While a lesson is learned, it's too late. Driving force comes from White males (no notable non-White characters), but women have more power and agency here than women used to in movies like this. Women here make their own choices, exert their own power. Extremely strong, gory violence. Long, bloody battles, fighting, hitting, bashing with weapons, head-butts, etc. Many bloody wounds. Fighters slathered in blood. Characters pierced with arrows, stabbed with swords, impaled with axes. A man rips another man's throat open with his teeth. Throat slicing. Severed heads. Bashed-in faces. Person's nose sliced off; mutilated face. Plucked-out eyes. Mutilated corpses hung from wall. Corpses with hearts carved out. Spilled intestines. Child stabbed (off-screen). Character attacked by dog, dog killed. Horse beheaded. Man stabs himself. Corpses hanging from trees. Naked male corpse. People bound in chains; depictions of slavery. Families are forcibly separated, with screaming young children taken from their parents. Woman hog-tied. Women roughly grabbed. Intense, eerie, nightmarish rituals. Scary stuff: witches, ghosts, the undead. Homes on fire. Vomiting. Incest. Rape is mentioned, and a man tries to have forced sex with an enslaved woman. In a group sex scene, it appears that some men might be forcibly grabbing women. Woman's naked bottom. Several men and women appear to be having sex during a celebration, with kissing, thrusting, caressing of bottoms, obscured nudity in the shadows, partial bottoms and partial breasts seen, etc. Kissing. Suggestion of incest. Brief shot of a woman dressing, with a gown sliding down over her body. Crude, sex-related humor. Sex-related dialogue. Shirtless males. Naked male corpse. Woman lifts dress to reveal that she's menstruating; brief shot of blood. (Content related to sexual violence is in the ""Violence"" section.) Parents need to know that The Northman is a bloody Viking revenge epic starring Nicole Kidman, Alexander Skarsgård, and Anya Taylor-Joy. It's powerfully and expertly made by director Robert Eggers but has intense, mature violence and sexual situations. Expect gory battle scenes; characters being hit with arrows, swords, and axes; a man ripping another man's throat with his teeth; severed heads, mutilated faces, and mutilated corpses; and the suggested deaths of a child, dog, horse, and more. Families are forcibly separated. Several characters appear to have sex -- and some women appear to be forcibly grabbed -- with thrusting, touching, and partial bare bottoms and breasts seen. A man tries to rape an enslaved woman; she deters him by lifting her dress and showing him her menstrual blood. There are other sexual situations and sex-related dialogue, as well as uses of ""bastard,"" ""bitch,"" ""whore,"" ""hell,"" ""swine,"" and ""piss."" Characters eat a ""magic"" mushroom stew and go on ""bad trips,"" and there's social drinking in taverns.

Loosely inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet, THE NORTHMAN opens in the year 895, with King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returning home to his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), after a long voyage. The king's brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), arrives and betrays him, assassinating him in a sneak attack. Amleth sees his mother being kidnapped and flees, vowing revenge. Years later, he has become a fearsome Viking (Alexander Skarsgård). When Amleth encounters a witch and learns Fjölnir's location, he disguises himself as an enslaved person and boards a ship for Iceland. He meets a healer named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and forms an unexpected bond with her. Forced to labor on a remote farm, Amleth meets another witch and is told the location of a magic sword. With the sword, Amleth begins to carry out his revenge, killing Fjölnir's men one by one. But before he battles Fjölnir himself in a fiery showdown, Amleth must face a terrible truth -- and make an impossible decision. Director Robert Eggers has created a powerful saga full of passion, rage, and dark fantasy. As with his remarkable debut feature The Witch, Eggers seems to have poured a ton of research into The Northman, as well as teaming with veteran Icelandic writer Sjón (Lamb) to capture an eerie authenticity. It feels like being transported back in time, rather than watching actors in costumes. Even though there's actually little going on here outside of a revenge plot, the movie has weight to it, something at stake. It feels like it was created by people who take pride in their craft. Recalling David Lowery's entrancing The Green Knight, The Northman switches with ease from earthy battle sequences slippery with mud and gore to unreal sequences of witches or Valkyries, all belonging to the same world. Yet as he proved with his previous movie, The Lighthouse, Eggers is equally skilled with actors and characters. The performances here are all impressive, but Kidman in particular can be so ferocious and startling that her work may feel like an actual sting. As for the overarching revenge plot, it does take 137 minutes to march toward the inevitable. But once it gets there, it does so with a surprisingly primal, visual palette, and it also manages to show the act as an exhausting, ever spiraling curse without end. Families can talk about The Northman's violence. How did it make you feel? Was it exciting? Shocking? What did the movie show or not show to achieve this effect? Why is that important? Why do you think Amleth ultimately chose revenge? Why might it have been extremely difficult for him to choose love and healing instead?

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," In The Northman, a new historical epic from filmmaker Robert Eggers, Viking carnage flows with an elegant, sometimes mischievous sense of showmanship. Not long after Amleth, the young son of a king (Ethan Hawke), has received his first instructions in the ways of Viking leadership, the king and his men are attacked by Amleth's uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). The insurgence captures Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and pursues the boy. He fights off his attackers, then runs, ducks, and hides throughout his village, as Eggers follows him with lateral camera movements, capturing the violence in a number of unbroken shots. This isn't the last blood that will flow, of course; Amleth will grow into a fearsome warrior (played as an adult by Alexander Skarsgård) hell-bent on revenge. Somehow, during all of this mayhem, I thought of Wes Anderson. It's not that Anderson invented the fine art of the side-tracking shot or another composition he and Eggers both favor, where characters stare into the camera from the center of the frame, often symmetrically flanked by others. Eggers has a whole set of influences, cinematic and otherwise, that are quite apart from Anderson's own, equally idiosyncratic array of sources. But The Northman — a massive jump up in scale and budget following Eggers' A24-distributed indies The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019) — shares with Anderson's films a sense of a specific corner of a movie world being filled out, with meticulousness and confidence. About a decade ago, this direction seemed open to a whole class of auteurs who first arrived on the film scene in the 1990s. Filmmakers like Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell, Darren Aronofsky, and Alexander Payne were realizing their visions with bigger stars, bigger budgets and, amazingly, bigger hits. Many of those efforts culminated in the 2010s with films like Aronofsky's Noah (2014), Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), and Russell's American Hustle (2013), which may not have been megaproductions by superhero standards, but looked (and grossed) like real Hollywood productions. Were '90s indies directors really taking over the modern industry? The answer, of course, was no; they were still de-prioritized in favor of further tentpole swelling. So it's all the more remarkable to see Eggers pick up that torch — and it hasn't necessarily been easy. He's given several interviews where he discusses a painful post-production process with the studio, New Regency Productions, as he was not given the final cut on The Northman and had to make some concessions toward legibility and entertainment value (which, he stresses — whether out of tact or desire to sell his expensive movie — have resulted in a film that he's proud of). Yet even this compromised vision of The Northman has real heft and vitality. A $90 million production really maximizes Eggers' distinctive style, here resulting in a 10th-century orgy of violence and melodrama that feels both immersive (as the 16th-century-set The Witch or the 19th-century-set The Lighthouse) and presentational. Eggers seems aware of what a movie-ish undertaking it is to shoot violence tearing through ""realistic"" Viking environments with graceful long takes and horror-movie bravado — or the inherent phoniness of recreating this stuff on film at all. For all of his obsessive research, Eggers is adapting a Viking folktale that may have inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet; he's putting on a hell of a show by his expensive campfire. That mix of detail-oriented realism and wild swings into mysticism and animalistic combat isn't just a budgetary flex; it lends The Northman a thematic gravity that keeps it from floating off into self-indulgent silliness. Like The Witch and The Lighthouse, there's an otherworldliness around the edges of The Northman, sometimes an elusive feeling and sometimes creeping into the imagery — which includes dreams, hallucinations, and moments that blur the lines between those visions and the movie's reality. The Northman's tales of battle, valor, and treachery are heightened and mythologized by the characters as they happen, perhaps as a way of forging some understanding and acceptance of their world's capricious cruelties. (And there are many: Men, women, and children all meet gruesome, horrific ends here, even if Amleth attempts to focus his rage on fellow men and allies with an enslaved woman, played by the appropriately otherworldy Anya Taylor-Joy.) The movie does not seek to indict these ways of thinking; in its gnarly, riveting way, it invites understanding. Hard as it may be to believe about a movie with such an inventive and constant array of disembowelings, there are times when it feels like Eggers is pulling back slightly, as if reluctant to betray the nasty brutishness of the time period by turning it into extended action sequences. This may be as close as he'll get to making an old-fashioned big-budget studio picture, not least because it's hard to picture anyone giving Eggers (or fellow new-class filmmakers like Ari Aster, Julia Ducournau, or Cory Finley) this much money without a piece of intellectual property firmly attached. It's why, even (or especially) with its particular cinematic flourishes, The Northman feels like something out of another era.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," These are the first words uttered in Robert Eggers’s debut feature film, The Witch, a line that now reads like a thesis statement for a director whose career feels singular just three films in. None of Eggers’s films takes place any later than the 1890s, and all are rich in the ascetic hardships of people exiled from society and laid low by physical, psychological, and spiritual torments, often of their own making. When William (Ralph Ineson) barks this rhetorical question at the leaders of a Puritan community in 1630s New England, it’s hard to fathom that people who fled England and crossed the sea to practice their faith could be called “false Christians” in a public forum. William is a seeker, willing to put himself and his family through the pain of banishment and isolation in order to get closer to God. He’s also a madman and a fool—but in an Eggers film, there’s scarcely much difference.  For 2015’s The Witch and his 2019 follow-up, The Lighthouse, the 38-year-old filmmaker famously immersed his cast and crew in the muck of his own obsessions, striking out to the hostile climes of northern Ontario and Nova Scotia in a bid to achieve bone-deep authenticity. (The $90 million budget for his new film, the superb Viking adventure The Northman, does not appear to have been spent on creature comforts.) Apart from any of their other qualities, Eggers’s films always strive to re-create a premodern time and place so vividly that they feel three-dimensional, alive with the menacing white noise that seeped through the walls before radios and television could drown it out. Close your eyes and you can hear the howling winds and bleating goats; a braying foghorn that harmonizes with clanking, coal-fired machinery; seagulls that shriek with the cursed souls of dead seamen. Open them and it doesn’t get better.  In Eggers’s first two films especially, there’s such a devotion to meticulous world-building that the director seems almost reluctantly obliged to move the story forward—or, at least, to satisfy whatever preconceived genre expectations an audience might have. The Witch is classified as a horror film, and earns that label through its chilling tale of Calvinist farmers nestled against a forest of Satanic allure. Yet it doesn’t behave like a conventional horror film, always favoring strange and uncanny events over overt shocks, while limiting much of the violence to a family torn asunder by its own lies, repression, and hypocrisy. The Lighthouse exists within an even less identifiable realm, like an experimental staging of Waiting for Godot that cycles through horror, psychodrama, and black comedy. Eggers may have finally given in to something close to a straight-up Viking revenge flick with The Northman, but he doesn’t seem to think about how his films might be tucked into one category or another. And that’s to say nothing of his unsettling payoffs.  What Eggers cares about is obsessive, Kubrickian attention to detail, putting faith in the idea that if he invests enough care in the particularities of language or architecture or costuming, the films will come to life long before the plot asserts itself. Interviews with Eggers tend to focus on his research, with an itemization of all the minutiae he gleaned from looking into a specific era. The Shakespearean language of The Witch, a stylized Early Modern English, was inspired by 17th-century primary sources, as were the hand-stitched and woven garments and the farming techniques. When shooting in New England proved too expensive, Eggers chose an alternative spot in Ontario because it had the tree types he needed. For The Lighthouse, he had a 70-foot working structure built on a godforsaken piece of land on the southern tip of Nova Scotia. The list of influences is long there, too: Jean Grémillon’s 1929 obscurity The Lighthouse Keeper, old code-of-conduct manuals, the region-specific dialect in the work of 19th-century Mainer Sarah Orne Jewett. The tension in Eggers’s New England in the early 17th and late 19th century comes from the relationship between the hard realities of everyday life and a not-entirely-unjustified belief in folktales and superstitions. When William and his wife, Katherine (Kate Dickie), take their five children—an infant, a young son, fraternal twins of Shining-like uncanniness, and the eldest, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), who’s developing a troublesome curiosity—to a clearing in the wilderness, the idea is to live in stricter accordance with biblical ideals. As their Garden of Eden starts to bear rotten fruit, they’re thrown into a crisis of faith that owes as much to the cold austerity of an Ingmar Bergman drama as it does any shocker about supernatural phenomena. When the youngest child disappears during a peekaboo session with Thomasin, there’s grief over the boy’s certain death, but the real horror is the fact that he hadn’t yet been baptized. They could bear the loss if they weren’t also certain he was going to hell.  Eggers doles out the scares sparingly, just enough for the audience to know that witches do haunt the forest and intend to engulf the family in their gruesome rituals. Even these devout Christians don’t doubt that such forces exist, and suspect Thomasin might be in league with their witchy ways, but Eggers approaches the situation much like Kubrick did in The Shining, seeing these outside stresses in part as a manifestation of deeper problems within the family. Sin trails them like Pig-Pen’s cloud of dirt, and cleansing themselves of it turns into a daily mantra, with William quizzing his eldest son about his “birth sin,” and the boy mechanically reciting words about the “corrupt nature” that dwells within him, imputed by Adam. The infant’s disappearance sows distrust in the family when it should bring unity, and the lies and recriminations spill out from there, as William especially fails to live up to his own standards.  For the Puritans and other settlers, America was a land of freedom and possibility, unspoiled and lush. The Witch is a brilliant countermyth, following the most righteous of families as they carve out their own slice of paradise and yield a bitter harvest in return with rotten corn and eggs, and a Satanic goat known as Black Phillip. It may be just desserts for occupying a land that wasn’t theirs to occupy, or, more likely, a suggestion on Eggers’s part that America wasn’t founded on virtue but corruptibility. Who can blame Thomasin, a virtuous young woman who’s nonetheless targeted for everything that happens, for finding herself susceptible to the devil’s temptations? “Wouldst thou like to live deliciously? Wouldst thou like to see the world?” Of course! Point those horns to the nearest pagan ritual, Black Phillip!  For Ephraim, working at the lighthouse quickly turns into a Sisyphean hell of rolling wheelbarrows full of coal up a hill and depositing them in the fiery maw of a furnace, as well as emptying chamber pots, hauling barrels of kerosene, and doing whatever chores Thomas imagines for him. But at least this physical and mental prison comes with a short sentence: In four weeks, he’ll be relieved of duty and move on to the next odd labor. But then he kills one of the gulls that had been pecking at him like he was Tippi Hedren, not realizing that it’s bad luck to kill seabirds, which Thomas claims host the angry souls of departed sailors. Sure enough, the wind shifts and the island is pummeled by a never-ending storm that spoils the food supply and any remaining goodwill between these two men. Ahead lies madness and death, just as it does in The Witch.  Stripped to its essence, The Lighthouse is mostly a two-hander that could be squeezed onto the tiniest of theatrical stages, but in Eggers’s hands, it’s a feast for the senses, trapping the audience in multiple confinements at once—an island shrouded in fog and pounded by waves and rainstorms, the fart-filled attic of two men condemned to live with each other indefinitely, and Ephraim’s mind, which is sickened by alcohol and troubled by dreams of mermaids, tentacled creatures, and drowning deaths. There’s a spiritual element to The Lighthouse, too, in a lantern room that Ephraim cannot access; Eggers makes it seem like the gates of Heaven, with Thomas as Saint Peter holding the keys to the kingdom. In truth, it’s more like the glowing suitcase in the noir classic Kiss Me Deadly or the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark, a coveted item right up to the moment when somebody cracks it open. With Eggers dialing the clock back to the first century for The Northman and using another imposing site of human barbarity as his backdrop, he seems to be establishing himself as a master of forgotten, nightmarish realms and the people within who struggled to keep the last flicker of their humanity (and sanity) alive. The Witch and The Lighthouse are also reminders of a spiritual hunger that may take wildly different forms, including a deranged goat. The trick is to figure out the false prophets from the real ones, and which curses, superstitions, and unholy temptations might actually be consequential and life-altering.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," To be or not to be a remake of Hamlet: that is the question. The answer is that Robert Eggers’s new period epic The Northman is based on the same 12th century legend that initially inspired William Shakespeare. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Sulking in exile after the murder of his father by an unscrupulous uncle, a Scandanavian prince plots his return and revenge. There will be blood.  All the way back in 1993, Last Action Hero spoofed the idea of Hamlet as blockbuster spectacle—a classic recontextualized in the vulgar language of Hollywood. That was satire; Eggers’s broad, muscular slab of Vikingsploitation earnestly gives it a shot. There’s a bit of Arnold Schwarzenegger here, too: In high-concept terms,  The Northman is Hamlet meets Conan the Barbarian, with all the bloody pulp, bulging abs, and hallucinatory grandeur that marriage implies. Instead of a guy monologuing mournfully to a skull in a graveyard, we get crucial dialogue delivered by a severed head. Alas, poor Willem Dafoe—we knew him well.  Dafoe’s decapitated cameo provides The Northman with one of its undeniable highlights. His presence also creates a point of connection to Eggers’s last outing, The Lighthouse, which dealt with big themes of isolation, masculinity, and madness in the guise of a slow-burning, phantasmagorical maritime legend (with Dafoe basically playing the Sea Captain from The Simpsons). Big themes are sort of Eggers’s thing; three films into a career that began with the rich Puritan symbolism and expertly engineered shocks of The Witch—a Nathaniel Hawthorne–style folktale examining dogmatic Christian misogyny and the symbiotic relationship between good and evil—the 38-year-old director continues to weave and stretch the fabric of genre cinema around his ideas like a pro. Certainly, the nearly $90 million price tag for The Northman suggests a filmmaker who’s currently in fashion. What’s at stake in its release is on one level industrial: the commercial prospects of blockbuster entertainment not derived from expensive IP (unless you consider the Shakespeare Extended Universe to be a rival to Marvel). More importantly, though, the film is an aesthetic reckoning for its creator and his audience. In a moment when any filmmaker with a recognizable style is being hailed as a visionary, it’s worth asking whether Eggers just has decent taste in hand-me-downs, plucking his imagery off the rack from the Kubrick and Tarkovsky wing of the Criterion Collection. It’s also worth asking, even more skeptically, whether The Northman is just the emperor’s new clothes—the pricey, brand-conscious work of a faux-teur exposed by his own naked hubris? In period epics, showmanship and scholarship are often intertwined, and Eggers is a stickler for detail. Like David Lowery’s recent Medievalist fantasia The Green Knight, The Northman is trying to apply state-of-the-art craft to old-school material. (If The Green Knight was classical balladry, The Northman plays like its black metal B-side.) Eggers’s biggest interest is in linguistic authenticity: The Witch and The Lighthouse were both written and acted in rigorously old-timey dialects. The Northman, which was cowritten by the Icelandic poet Sjon, has its share of subtitled passages as well, although not as many as its makers might have hoped. Instead, the characters speak in a uniformly Nordic lilt. “Maybe one day I can self-finance my own historical epics like Mel Gibson, but it had to be in English,” Eggers told The Independent. ​​“Given the choices, I think I picked the best option … I hope.” Invoking Mel Gibson is a bit risky given that The Northman potentially scans as a hymn to Ubermenschian ideals; in 1982, reviewing Conan the Barbarian, Roger Ebert expressed discomfort with its fascist-slash-white-supremacist undertones. “When [James Earl Jones]’s head was sliced off and contemptuously thrown down the flight of stairs by the muscular blond Conan,” he wrote, “I found myself thinking that Leni Riefenstahl could have directed the scene, and that Goebbels might have applauded it.” Eggers has already spoken on the record about his disdain for the co-opting of Nordic iconography by various right-wing movements, but leaving aside the very real potential for social media dustups or accusatory thinkpieces, The Northman doesn’t seem like a particularly political film. If it has a moral, it’s an echo of the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold.  A film with that kind of ice in its veins requires sources of warmth, and Hawke fits the bill. His performance channels some of the same tender, paternal charisma he’s previously displayed for Richard Linklater. There’s a lovely moment when, greeting his 11-year-old son and heir Amleth (Oscar Novak)—guess who the name’s an anagram for—Aurvandil feigns disciplinarian harshness before enfolding the kid in a massive, grunting bearhug. The father-son bonding doesn’t stop there. A couple of scenes later, the pair engage in the Viking equivalent of having a catch: they descend into a cave, pretend to be wolves, and ritualistically trip balls in front of a burning wall of fire. It’s in sequences like these that Eggers seems to be testing his audience, his abilities, or some combination of both—like he’s walking a tightrope between the ridiculous and the sublime, not caring about whether he falls. “One day, this kingdom will be yours,” intones Hawke sonorously in what is basically a straight-faced paraphrase of this bit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail; it’s up to us whether to laugh or not. There was a certain winking humor lurking on the margins of The Witch, with its self-fulfilling parable about a teenager who’s so terrorized by her family’s piety that she chooses to live deliciously instead. The Lighthouse went even further into mythic slapstick, peaking when Robert Pattinson’s Thomas Howard grabs one of the ominous, Hitchcockian crows tormenting his daily toil and splatters it against a wall like a carton of eggs. The vision-quest stuff in The Northman is goofy as hell, but it’s also hard to begrudge Eggers his excess: like Hawke says, the guy is trying. And all the visual bombast helps to offset the predictability of the setup, which finds Aurvandil betrayed and ambushed in a moment of weakness by his younger brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang), who quickly puts a hit out on Amleth, as well, only for the boy to escape by rowboat.  The next time we see our hero, he’s aged and grown into an absolutely ripped Alexander Skarsgard, whose beastmode physicality is deployed even better here than in Tarzan. Skarsgard’s Amleth doesn’t cut just a graphic-novel figure: Now rolling deep with a clan of rampaging berserkers and functioning for his adoptive comrades as the tip of the spear, he’s like a swirl of flesh-and-blood CGI. Eggers’s intention in these re-introductory sequences is to shock us with the severity of the character’s transformation, but we also get a sense of how strategically he’s holding back. While Amleth is happy to maul and pillage—and he’s very, very good at it—he draws the line at killing women and children.  Another, larger flaw is that, having built up a good head of steam, the film shifts into a neutral gear around its midpoint. Now disguised as a slave, Amleth heads to a rural village lorded over by Fjolnir, who’s since downsized his empire yet still treats himself (and his son by Amleth’s mother) as royalty. Amleth is tipped to his uncle’s location by the creepy Scandanavian Seeress (Björk, nicely typecast), who tells him that vengeance is his destiny; once he’s reached his destination, he keeps his head down and bides his time, forming a confessional, conspirational bond with another defiant slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). “Your strength breaks men’s bones, but I have the cunning to break their minds,” she tells him before contriving a series of gory, Animal House–style pranks against Fjolnir’s goons to literally put the fear of God into them. The fact that Amleth wants to torment his uncle and test his faith before straight up cutting him in half with a sacred sword is pretty funny, and in a perverse way, so is the existential curveball thrown late in the film by his mother, Queen Gudrún—a putative damsel in distress. Her Highness is played by Nicole Kidman in a role that seems completely thankless right until it doesn’t, at which point it gives the actress some of her best material in years: a big scene with Skarsgard that functions as a for-your-consideration clip, a Big Little Lies reunion, and a lightning rod for controversy. By contrast, the romantic sequences between Amleth and Olga are weirdly dry despite all the chiseled, exposed flesh between them. With the exception of one daringly full-frontal, R-rated moment of physical comedy, Taylor-Joy’s performance is too subdued. The spooked, uncanny quality that the actress had in The Witch doesn’t come through enough in a role that tries (and fails) to thread a strand of feminist defiance through Eggers’s alpha-male machismo. It’s hard to square Olga’s ultimate role as a vessel for her lover’s royal bloodline with any progressive subversion. In the homestretch, the only thing we’re really meant to feel is a triumphal connection to Amleth’s bloodlust, a far cry from the sophisticated critique at the end of Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel, which looks by comparison like a real film of ideas.  The Last Duel was also moving, as was The Green Knight. The Northman is a lot of things—bruising, rousing, and often entertaining—but it’s not particularly complex. At one point, Amleth gets to ponder his own version of Hamlet’s “to be or not to be” dilemma—a choice between vengeance and being a good family man—before deciding he can have it both ways. It’s less a case of authentic ambivalence than carefully disguised crowd-pleasing. And while the film is filled with declarations of passion, The Northman isn’t very emotional. When Björk’s Seeress tells Amleth “remember for whom your last tear was shed,” it merely calls attention to how wan and dry Eggers’s palette is when he’s not drenching everything in blood. A key plot point involving a character’s heart being cut out and thrown away functions unintentionally as a metaphor for the overall awed, brutalizing sense of detachment on display. Eggers deserves kudos for refusing to compromise, but the fact that he made The Northman entirely on his own terms means he’s also entirely responsible for its shortcomings.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," In The Witch and The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers meticulously built worlds based on old folklore and mythology to examine themes of isolation, masculinity, and societal expectation. These wildly imaginative interpretations on genre attracted attention from critics and audiences alike, leading to great anticipation for the director’s next project. However, as Eggers’ first foray into action blockbuster filmmaking, The Northman has led to a few reservations over yet another small indie director running into a tough post-production process for a blockbuster project. Although it occasionally gets bogged down in the plot elements of its bloody tale of revenge, the result mostly allays these fears by creating a brutal and mystical world filled with Viking rituals, witches, and prophecies.  Co-writers Eggers and Sjón’s story may be a familiar one. It takes inspiration from Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which itself is based on Saxo Grammaticus’ Vita Amlethi, a Danish legend that follows a Norseman’s quest for revenge. In the film, a young prince named Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnesses his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) murder his beloved father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and claim the kingdom along with his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Due to Viking duty, Amleth makes his sole purpose to avenge his father, rescue his mother, and murder his uncle, repeating his mission as a mantra and promise to the gods. Now a man, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is a berserker who raids and pillages lands for different kings and noblemen. He receives a prophecy from the Seeress (Björk) that sets him on his journey for vengeance.  The savage nature of The Northman is a welcome departure from the softened violence of many modern blockbusters. The film exists in a world where decapitation and dismemberment are a way of life and living honorably means dying on the battlefield. Amleth and Aurvandill take part in an initiation ritual where they crawl on all fours and howl like wolves while the berserkers dance into a trance-like state and summon the spirit of bears before combat. The visual style is so potent that one can almost smell the muddy bodies reek of dry sweat and blood while the bone-chilling battle cries and score from composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough add to an experience that swings between overwhelming intensity and haunting beauty. Intricate tracking shots capture the berserkers’ rage in a village raid scene and follow Amleth as he sneaks through Fjölnir’s farmstead with murderous intent. All of this culminates into a detailed and lived-in depiction of the brutality of Viking life.  While Eggers’ precise vision is commendable, Amleth’s actual journey is rather straightforward. In his previous two films, Eggers excelled when he mostly excised plot elements in favor of nailing the fine details of the language and design of the setting. As a revenge tale, The Northman is somewhat restricted to following a set storyline, occasionally making it feel the need to explain even the more cryptic events happening onscreen. The formulaic plotting is made more apparent as Amleth is occasionally a tough character to root for. This is partly due to the near impossible task that Skarsgård has in showing the soul behind Amleth’s rage and the atrocities he commits.  However, the film’s strength is found in highlighting the tragedy in Amleth’s devotion to taking vengeance for only a fading memory of his deceased father. As an orphaned child, he is both unable and resistant to overcoming his trauma, with his upbringing only allowing him a single tear to grieve the death of his father. Through its themes of masculinity, The Northman avoids glorifying its violence by instead depicting a man who has it as his only tool to process his pent-up emotions.  Much of the soul of the film comes from Amleth’s lover Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who gives Amleth someone to lose as he continues on with his death-defying quest. While he plans to murder Fjölnir, she shows him a tenderness that is in sharp contrast to the unfeeling Viking life. Sadly, the film is too reliant on her to provide Amleth with more tangible feelings, and it relegates her to a character only defined by her relationship to the fallen prince. Queen Gudrún fares better as her scathing speech challenges Amleth’s ideas of honor and glory, complicating his desire for vengeance with a pursuit toward an actual future. Overall, The Northman is impressive in its visceral filmmaking. It encourages analysis while simultaneously delivering an entertaining action epic. While there are a few setbacks in its rudimentary plot, Eggers has crafted a studio film with equal amounts of fun, artistry, and thematic substance. It is a shining example of what blockbuster films can be and hopefully is a sign for studios to take more risks in the future.  Alex Nguyen is an aspiring entertainment writer as well as a film and music enthusiast based in Seattle, WA.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is not for the faint of heart. Its a haunting, bold, and brutal Viking epic."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ bloody and bone-cracking and yet beautiful Viking saga “The Northman” is set primarily in 10th-century Iceland—but every frame of this 137-minute epic makes us feel as if we’ve been plunged neck-deep into the violent dread of Dante’s Seventh Circle of Hell. Even the kings and queens and landowners in this fiery fever dream seem miserable and unfulfilled, while just about everyone else is either a brutally cruel henchman guarding and abusing slaves in forced labor camps, or one of the legions of slaves who are treated as sub-human creatures. This is not to say “The Northman” itself is unrelentingly grim. Director Eggers (“The Witch,” “Lighthouse”) is a boldly creative visionary, and his stunning visuals and hallucinatory staging of scenes makes for the kind of movie that really should be seen on the big screen. Drawing on the same well of Scandinavian culture and folklore (with a sprinkling of known historical events) that provided the foundation for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” Eggers and his co-writer, the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, have crafted a sprawling and visceral tale with elements of everything from “Gladiator” to “Conan the Barbarian” to “Braveheart,” and at times it reminded me of a particularly pricey episode of “Game of Thrones.” Greatly enhancing that mix is a cast of some of our most interesting actors, from Ethan Hawke to Nicole Kidman to Anya Taylor-Joy to the Skarsgårds Alexander and Bill to Willem Dafoe as “Heimir the Fool” and if you’re casting your Viking epic and there’s a call for a “Heimir the Fool,” who better to answer that call than Willem Dafoe? “The Northman” opens with an extended prologue in which King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) returns from war, wounded but victorious, where he is greeted by his loyal, long-locked wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his adoring young son Amleth (Oscar Novak). The celebration is short-lived, however, when Aurvandil’s nefarious and bloodthirsty brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), murders the king and takes the queen as his own bride. The terrified but resourceful young Amleth (and yes, Shakespeare created “Hamlet” as an anagram for “Amleth”) manages to escape, at which point we flash forward some 20 years, with Alexander Skarsgård taking on the role of Amleth, who is all dirty and muddy and battered and bruised but is also so built and so ripped it looks as if he discovered the first Equinox gym and hasn’t skipped a workout in years. Amleth has become a great Viking warrior, but he becomes a stowaway and deliberately surrenders to slavery just so he can infiltrate the remote plantation farm owned by evil ol’ Uncle Fjölnir, whose reign was apparently cut short—but hey, it appears he got a pretty sweet real estate deal as part of his exile. Along the way, Amleth meets and instantly falls in love with a Slavic slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who has a fiercely independent personality and just might be a sorceress, but probably not, but maybe. Once Amleth arrives at his destination, he’s shocked to see his mother is still with Fjölnir (neither Almeth’s uncle nor mother recognizes him), appears to be happy and has even given him a son, Thorir (Gustav Lindh). Before Amleth confronts his mother to see if she still needs saving, before he faces off with his murderous uncle in the inevitable duel to the death, the story makes room for all kinds of violence, madness, sorcery, special effects and award-worthy costumes. Why, there’s even time for a deadly match of a sport that appears to be a cross between croquet, cricket and Quidditch, only with extreme violence and the bashing of skulls. “The Northman” is often insanely over the top and there are moments when it feels as if Eggers could maybe ease his foot off the pyrotechnic pedals, but still, this is one of the most strikingly original and brutally effective movies of the year so far."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Were you appalled by the viciousness of Kirk Douglas’ Einar character in 1958’s The Vikings? Was the “viking handkerchief” face washing scene in 1999’s The 13th Warrior one of the most disgusting things ever? Think you know what a viking is? You have no idea. Having set out to make the definitive Viking movie with The Northman, director, co-writer Robert Eggers – along with writing partner, Icelandic poet, Sjón – shoots for unconditional authenticity by working with archaeologists and historians to get all the tiny minutiae of the Viking physical world right. Say what you will about the importance of accuracy in a Viking movie set in the 10th century AD, but there’s no denying that with The Northman, Eggers has indeed, created the definitive Viking movie. In addition to his brilliant attention to detail when bringing to life the physical world of 10th Century Scandinavia, Eggers also clearly pays close attention to the inner workings of the Viking mind: their beliefs, mythology, and ritual life. Coming from the twisted mind behind such epic atmospheric pressure cookers as The Witch and The Lighthouse, the fact that he focuses on the “who” and “how” with little emphasis on the “why” should certainly come as no surprise. The Northman finds its biggest success in its depiction of Viking rituals, their spiritual beliefs, and how closely knit the people were to nature. Something we’ve not really seen in a Viking movie. With shades of Beowulf and Braveheart in its DNA, The Northman is a bloody revenge story. Plain and simple. A loosely retold Hamlet, with Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth a Viking prince robbed of his heir to the kingdom as a young boy when his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bong, The Girl in the Spider's Web) kills Amleth’s father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), and kidnaps his mother (Nicole Kidman). Set on avenging his father’s death, Amleth sets out on an epic quest across the North Atlantic in search of those responsible for his father’s death. When Amleth learns that his uncle has been dethroned and now takes up residence in Iceland, Amleth stows away on a slave ship bound for Iceland with eyes set on avenging his father’s death. Along the journey, Amleth befriends a fellow slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, The Queen’s Gambit), who holds an interesting connection to the supernatural. Norse and Viking mythology, as depicted in many recent film and TV shows, paints a highly romanticized and glossy picture designed to look good on the screen. Well, this isn’t one of those. This is Eggers and this is The Northman. Nothing is pretty. In fact, quite the opposite. These people weren’t clean. We smell the stench of their bodies as they slog through the unsanitary filth of muddy, makeshift camps. Neither were they pretty, and they certainly weren’t very civilized. Having traded in slavery, they robbed and pillaged the countryside at random, and their chosen form of entertainment was a game called knattleikr, a violent precursor to modern day lacrosse in which the last player left breathing is the winner… and we watch it play out in its full bloody glory. Though The Northman is not a horror movie, there is plenty of gore and there are horror beats throughout its narrative that will likely provide some cross-appeal to those genre fans. But it’s the brutally honest depiction, without judgment, of the Vikings that further sets Eggers’ film apart from others in the genre. The beauty of the Icelandic countryside juxtaposes nicely against the brutality and savagery of the people who inhabit it. Speaking of brutality. Consider yourself forewarned. Pretty much every living thing that appears on the screen will be slaughtered at one time or another – humans and animals alike. You’ll want to cover your eyes more than once. It ain’t pretty, but it is certainly real. Eggers, along with Oscar-nominated cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, employs long, dense camera takes which further immerse us into the culture of the people. Defying the principles of conventional filmmaking, the whole thing becomes a totally intense and immersive experience that somehow endears us to its power and beauty despite a total lack of charm and absence of even a single redeeming character to latch on to. It’s all just so perfectly done. The Northman has arrived! Universal Studios brings Robert Eggers' epic historical viking movie to 4k with a fantastic 2160 Dolby Vision, HDR10 transfer included in the 2-disc 4K Ultra HD + Blu-ray + Digital code Collector's Edition of The Northman. The black eco-case comes with a 4K UHD disc, a blu-ray disc, and a digital code coupon housed inside a nifty embossed, foil-stamped cardboard slip cover. The 2.00:1 2160p UHD Dolby Vision transfer is an outstanding one that remains true to the bleakness of Eggers' vision. This is a dark movie. Very dark, with oftentimes the only light coming from the moon itself, or perhaps a fire or flaming torches. The film's natural grain remains true and consistent even in the blackest of dark scenes. These natural-lit night scenes are absolutely spectacular. Individual hairs on fur clothing and every bit of dirt and grime on the faces of the characters is sharp and crisp. The film comes with a Dolby Atmos and a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 audio track. There is always something happening with Dolby Atmos track, whether it be the front-centered dialogue, or the crackling of fires from behind, or the grunting of human or animal from anywhere – including from above. When things get loud, and they do quite often, the room shakes and the windows rattle, yet atmospheric sounds remain tender and appropriately placed. This one will give you a great opportunity to stretch out your audio system. With nearly an hour of bonus material, which includes interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, in addition to an engaging commentary track, this 4K UHD + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition of The Northman is a must-own for fans of the film.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," When you think of Vikings, your mind probably defaults to tall, blond men wearing furs and horned helmets, riding in a long boat with a dragon masthead and their shields attached to the sides. Of course, some of you probably think of bulky dudes in purple and yellow, but that's a different story. If you thought of Hagar the Horrible, you need to read better comic strips. Obviously, the horn-helmeted variety is a cartoonish stereotype. All it takes is one person to come along, break that mold and force us to reexamine our preconceived notions. That person is director Robert Eggers, and he does so with his latest film, The Northman. King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) rules his kingdom with his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and son Amleth by his side. When Aurvandill is betrayed by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), Amleth is able to escape to the sea, vowing to someday return to avenge his father and save his mother. Years later, adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has been raised by a band of marauders. After they attack a village, Amleth finds out the captured citizens they've sold into slavery are being sent to his uncle, who now lives across the ocean in Iceland. Amleth pretends to be one of the slaves and joins the journey. On the boat he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a woman versed in the natural arts, and together they plot to carry out Almeth's vendetta. The Northman is an epic saga of revenge, told in that manner Eggers has perfected over the course of only three films. It's unflinchingly realistic, deliberately paced and leaves you with your breath taken and your mind expanded. If the above plot description sounds a touch familiar, it's because the Scandinavian legend of Amleth was Shakespeare's inspiration for Hamlet. Eggers, thankfully, presents the tale in much less dense prose than The Bard. Heck, it's even less dense than the dialogue in his own The Witch, though it's still florid in its own way. The entire cast is superb, making it difficult to single out any one performance. They all handle the thick dialogue and—if necessary, based on real life nationality—accents very well. If I were to choose a particular performance, it would be that of Willem Dafoe as Heimir, Aurvandill's jester. It's unhinged Dafoe at its purest. The film also looks gorgeous, or as gorgeous as a film so covered in mud and blood can look. The cinematography by Jarin Blaschke wonderfully captures the bleak beauty of the countryside, while never once allowing it to eclipse the grimness of the story.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman might be Eggers at his most traditional, yet its his best feature, which is saying a lot because hes created nothing but bangers. It makes me wanna run to Iceland and grow a beard and abs."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A bloody, muddy, beautiful and sometimes surreal vision of Norse myth."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers has ascended in the last few years on the strength of a pair of relatively low-budget, minimalist efforts, 2015's The Witch and 2019's The Lighthouse, both A24 releases. Both of Eggers' earlier films feature inedible images and memorable moments, with Willem Dafoe's ""Fond of Me Lobster"" speech in the latter gaining instant immortality. Now, Eggers has gotten away from minimalism with The Northman. It's a period piece like the other two, but it's bigger and more ambitious than the director's earlier work, with a much larger budget, bigger stars, and greater narrative ambition. It's from Focus Features rather than A24. And while The Lighthouse remains his best film to date, The Northman represents a successful transition to the higher-budget echelon. The film, which Eggers directed and co-wrote with the help of the Icelandic poet known as Sjon, is adapted from Scandinavian mythology, and most specifically the legend of Amleth. If it feels like Hamlet, that's not a coincidence; the Amleth was said to have inspired Shakespeare's play, although there's no ""to be or not to be"" as Amleth is never less than decisive. Set in the 10th century and featuring lots of mountain vistas and other iconographies often shown on the margins of hype videos for the Minnesota Vikings, The Northman was filmed in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In his first big role, on True Blood, Alexander Skarsgard played a Viking, and his character's name was Eric Northman. Now, he's a Northman once again, as the adult version of Prince Amleth. In Hamlet-like fashion, Amleth's father the king is murdered, and usurped by his uncle. This sets off a complex quest of revenge, over many years, including sword fights, volcanos, prophecies, disemboweling of human hearts, and lots of yelling. It’s long at 137 minutes, and a hard film to follow, even if you know your Viking history, but most watching will grasp at least the broad strokes. Skarsgard more than holds his own in the lead role, while Claes Bang is appropriately smarmy as the villain. Nicole Kidman gives a delightfully batshit performance as the Gertrude character, while Anya Taylor-Joy—whose breakthrough came in Eggers' The Witch—continues her strong run of recent performances. Other well-known performers show up in much smaller roles, including Ethan Hawke as the king, Willem Dafoe as a jester, and Bjork, ending a more than 20-year screen absence. Also on board are The Witch veteran Ralph Ineson, and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, who played The Mountain on Game of Thrones. In fact, it's a bit of a surprise the cast isn't riddled with Westeros alumni. I'm more partial to last year's The Green Knight, which found a more human story in ancient Northern European lore. But The Northman is a fine effort from a rising filmmaker, who clearly has many outstanding films in his future."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL," After the excellent results obtained with The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), American director Robert Eggers is abandoning the horror genre that allowed him to make a name for himself. His new film, The Northman, is an unengaging, mythologically charged story of revenge that takes place in 10th-century Iceland. Actors Willem Dafoe, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Kate Dickie team up again with the director but with minor roles, while the heavyweights Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, and Ethan Hawke join him for the first time in this exhausting, Hamlet-(un)inspired epic in need of a better dramaturgical arc. Eggers, who co-wrote the script with Sjón, takes us to the kingdom of King Aurvandil (Hawke), who is betrayed and slayed by his half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). The king’s only son and heir to the throne, Prince Amleth (played as an adult by Skarsgard), manages to escape, swearing revenge. He returns many years after, in the company of an enslaved sorcerer named Olga (Taylor-Joy), to finally avenge his father’s death and free his mother, Queen Gudrún (Kidman).  Denoting a certain grim integrity, the film has its visual beauty exceeded only by the gruesomeness of the violence. As for the rest, there’s a scarce amount of cleverness here. The adrenaline refuses to pump, even when multiple screams of rage burst from the Viking’s mouth, and the execution didn’t satisfy, with Eggers often showing indecision between pure rawness and the frivolous adornment that typically mark high-budget flicks. By comparison, David Lowery’s The Green Knight (2021) was as darkly medieval as this one, but brought much more mysticism and ambiguity to the setting. The Northman has a limited payoff after two hours, and not even an unexpected finale saves it from averageness."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Recently, I decided I probably don't like Shakespeare. I watched the Denzel Washington objet d'art ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"" and squirmed in my seat, hoping Lady Macbeth would add another damned spot to her hands and give me sweet release from tedium. ""The Northman"" is a new film from fantasy-horror whiz Robert Eggers, and it's not Shakespeare, which is great news for my will to live. It's also not not Shakespeare: Eggers based this tale of Nordic revenge on the Danish legend that inspired ol' Billy's ""Hamlet."" Of course, I didn't grow up on folk tales from Denmark, and unless you're a immortal elf stalking the fjords, you didn't either. It's nigh-impossible to view this gorgeous, disturbing sliver of sword 'n' sorcery outside the lens of ""Alas, poor Yorick!"" and all that. For fans of Eggers' bad-trip folk tales like ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse,"" that's both a boon and a curse upon the surprisingly conventional ""Northman."" In ancient-ish Nordic lands, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns home from war to Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman and a wig), young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) and the brother-who-won't-be-king Fjölnir (Claes Bang). The royal warlord has seen better days and takes his son on a vision quest in order to prepare him to take the throne.  But instead of a stately tapestry, the fates have spun the thread of their lives into a particularly ugly sweater. Fjölnir murders his brother and steals the queen, ordering his nephew Amleth's death, too. But the prince evades this fate and runs toward an exile that over many years turns him into Alexander Skarsgård and a pair of unbelievable trapezius muscles. After a post-pillage encounter with a witch who looks a lot like Björk because she is played by Björk, the adult Amleth returns to his homeland with a wily young sorceress (Anya Taylor-Joy, doing her schtick from ""The New Mutants"") on a mission of Viking vengeance. Destiny, he finds, his not necessarily easy. Eggers has become revered by some genre fans for the deliriously dark corners he's willing to go in the name of unhinged cinematic moments. ""The Witch"" has its Satanic goat (Black Phillip, we'll never forget you), and ""The Lighthouse"" had ... well, there were many things that movie had, starting with a mermaid and continuing with Willem Dafoe basically being a demonic Cap'n Crunch. ""The Northman"" has some hallucinatory shoes to fill, in other words, and destiny hangs over each frame like a black cloud. Björk's eyeless prophet is just one of its chief messengers, as is Dafoe in typically pop-eyed form. Any time Eggers plunges Amleth into occult happenings beyond his understanding, the movie sings. It's a spooky song, it's got a great beat and you can scream to it. You might scream, too, at how gross ""The Northman"" is willing to go. You want farts? You want bloody frontal nudity? You want bodies dissembled and rearranged into shapes that bodies normally do not find themselves? I would say that perhaps those are weird things to want! But if you do not mind them, many of millions of dollars have helped bring them to your local theater. And yet, with all of this — even the all-too-short Björk of it all! — ""The Northman"" tells a conventional story. Perhaps that's the peril of remixing Shakespeare's own remix. We know the stoic brute, we know the treacherous uncle, we know the date with destiny. We have, if nothing else, seen ""The Lion King."" Eggers exhumes the bones of a primal myth and arranges them in spectacular fashion, no doubt. But just as ""The Northman"" itself is interested in scrying meaning from old ways, you'll want to find something to take away here. Will you reconsider the meaning of redemption, or realize something about legacy, or even discern a nihilistic statement about power? Mostly, there's just violence, ugliness and hunky, unbathed men meting those things out. Vikings can get you only so far, maybe. But hey, throw a certain Icelandic pop star in there and you're at least gonna have a good time."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"An intense, brutal, and captivating two-plus hours of watching bad people pay for their past deeds. Yes, revenge is cold, but in ""The Northman,"" it arrives in a top-notch artistic package. "
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Worth the watch for the intense, authentic period setting and grittygorgeous depiction of a legendary revenge story. Though the film takes itself a bit too seriously. As is often the case, Anya Taylor-Joy is the best thing about it."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," It’s hard to believe Robert Eggers’ $90 million Viking saga is just two films out from his rousing debut “The Witch,” which he made for a humble $4 million back in 2015. That moody, Colonial-era chiller went on to amass more than $25 million worldwide, reinvigorating the folk horror genre and pronouncing Eggers as the talent of tomorrow. Tomorrow is today as “The Northman” thunders into theaters, an ambitious, big-scale take on the A.D. 895 tale of Amleth, a classic (or the classic?) revenge drama that would later become the roots for the Shakespearean tragedy “Hamlet.” From the opening shots of an Icelandic volcano belching rivulets of lava and the churning north sea (the North Atlantic, as we now call it), Eggers casts a foreboding scape that brims with brutal beauty and primal allure. We often get Viking warriors crouched on all fours, grunting and howling as they channel their inner wolf during pre-battle rites conducted within the ring of a bonfire; no words, English or language of yore, fall from their lips. In chaptered segments, we begin with King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) returning from a conquest to his people, his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his young son, Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak). Hawke slips surprisingly well into the gruff, growly role, but Aurvandil’s not with us long; his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang, “The Square”) ambushes him and looks to kill the prince as well, but as lore and legend have it, Amleth is something of an Aquaman and can swim far and wide. In the next chapter we catch up with Amleth, now mature and ripped and played by Alexander Skarsgård (who played opposite Kidman as her husband in the series “Big Little Lies”) embarking upon a war party raid that is one long, gorgeously shot carnival of carnage. It’s not until the last drop of blood soaks into the mud (the film has that “Gladiator” sword-and-sandal texture to it, but mud-and-blood is a more apt tag) that you fully realize that Amleth is out for one thing: to even the score with Fjölnir. To do so, he poses as a slave working Fjölnir’s fields. You’d imagine with such strong genetic ties, his uncle might recognize his now burly and physically capable nephew, but he does not, and neither does his mother, who has taken up with Fjölnir and borne him a son. Much of the copious and well-staged violence unleashed onscreen is the manifestation of the molten rage that roils inside Amleth, who proves an efficient and unrestrained killing machine. Skarsgård carries the part strikingly, but it’s Kidman who shines in a multifaceted role in which everything is not as it appears. Eggers regular Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Witch”) throws in as Olga, a slave alongside Amleth who becomes his lover and co-conspirator, as does fellow Eggers ally Willem Dafoe (who co-starred with Robert Pattinson in “The Lighthouse”) as Aurvandil’s fool. Icelander Björk, in her first feature performance since “Dancer in the Dark” in 2000, takes up the part of the oracle who torments Amleth. Those who might be concerned that such a budget and scope might change or addle the filmmaker’s work can relax. “The Northman” feels strangely akin to Eggers’ earlier efforts; at the core, they’re all period pieces set in harsh, unforgiving surroundings haunted by the spirits of past inhabitants. Where those big dollars go are the sets, the stockaded villages, Viking ships and earth-roofed fiefdoms nestled into the rolling hills of Iceland. Eggers carries forward his animal obsession too. It was a menacing goat in “The Witch” and a baneful seagull in “The Lighthouse”; here we get a murder of crows that have Amleth’s back, not to mention his ability to commune with a friendly fox on his covert night stalks or Fjölnir’s pet bull mastiff. Not all of “The Northman” works – some of it’s muddled visually and linguistically, and at turns it gets a bit too feral for its own good – but the immersion and mood makes for a mesmerizing and haunting odyssey, much in the same way Terrence Malick’s dreamy “The New World” (2005) took us to back to our early colonial origins.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Dads! Planning a motorcycle trip anytime soon with your sons? Mom staying behind because she has “stuff to do”? Vroom—don’t walk—to the nearest cinema showing Robert Eggers’ The Northman, a visually resplendent Viking saga enfolding revenge, ideals of familial duty, and awesome silver jewelry. Eggers co-wrote the film with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, with an eye toward capturing old Norse culture as a rich repository of art, poetry, and spiritual beliefs. Other contributions to history include tests of manhood involving farting and belching. The Vikings were complicated people. The story opens in the early 10th century in the British Isles, where fresh-faced 10-year-old Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) is destined to succeed his father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). But Aurvandil’s troublemaking brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) wreaks murderous havoc on that plan, carrying Amleth’s mother Gudrun off like a prize. (She’s played by Nicole Kidman, in a marvelous crimped mane à la Studio 54.) Young Amleth escapes the violence, vowing revenge, and after growing into the beefy form of Alexander Skarsgard, sets out to get it. He also makes sweet love to saucy enslaved girl Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), and has a hallucinatory meeting with a blind seer (Björk) who urges him not to stray from his mission. Eggers, too, takes his mission seriously, at times fulfilling it with unintentionally comical solemnity. “Your sword is long!” exclaims one of the Viking womenfolk as she gazes upon Amleth’s ancestral iron weapon. Still, there’s always something to look at in this cracked magisterial landscape of moss and mud and angry volcanoes. The Northman, whether you approach it as legitimate folklore or as a testosterone-fueled Saturday-afternoon lark, speaks to the 10-year-old boy in all of us, with a loud and mighty Viking burp."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," If you’re not having your senses bludgeoned by The Northman, you’ll admire all the historical detail and period madness. Fire and brimstone meet rot and decay, yet there’s ambition afoot here.” The dark intensity that has imbued director-writer Robert Eggers first two directorial features has matured with the size of his budget. Those earlier, earthy, arthouse horror tales — The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2018) — built up his auteur reputation for severe production design, period detail, uneasy tension, and compelling storytelling. Yet they are mere pawns on his cinematic chessboard for the $90 million The Northman (vs. $4 and $11 million for his first two films). This Viking saga like no other will test whether his terrifying and violent visionary— and now quite expensive — work will be accepted by a wider, mainstream audience. It should be. You may turn away from the brutal 10th century blood-letting, but this is one extremely satisfying film. This fiercely proud and brawny Hamlet prequel, with a script by Eggers and Icelandic novelist/poet Sjón, makes more than a few allusions to the Shakespeare piece, starting with an anagram for the main character’s name. Amleth is a young prince when his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is decapitated by the boy’s uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) is taken away. Two decades after the 10-year-old boy (Oscar Novak) witnessed this horrifying event, he has morphed into a monster of a man (Alexander Skarsgård, also a producer on this project), filled with fiery revenge. His bloodlust fostered by years he has spent with a gang of Viking berserkers pillaging riverside villages in Eastern Europe, his fate turns after a meetup with a Slav Witch (Björk, ever so briefly), and news that his uncle is now a ruthless fallen-from-grace farmer in a very small piece of Iceland. He heads to that remote landscape, masquerading as a hunched-over slave with vacant eyes, his demeanor hiding his inner drive from all but Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, who earned her first credited role as the star of Eggers’ debut feature), a slave woman with whom he forms a destiny-tinged bond. The visceral family reunion turns deceptively bold and mercilessly blood-spattered as Amleth selectively removes all those in his path to self-seeking righteousness. It’s a bumpy, bloody ride. The filmmaker’s laborious work ethic spanned two weather-plagued and covid-affected years — a huge jump from the 25- and 35-day shoots on which he built his distinctive reputation. Such detail-oriented work may require multiple viewings to fully appreciate the film’s grim, muddy look. The director reunited with his production designer (Craig Lathrop, putting a good face on squalid), cinematographer (Jarin Blachke, lover of the long shot and hater of the hand-held), costume designer (Linda Muir, offering a primitive Scandinavian look – at least when the anti-hero isn’t baring his muscular chest), and editor (Louise Ford, responsible for the assured pacing, pushing the action into your lap, and a providing a good deal of the squirming you experience). Making a bold addition to Eggers’ realm are Maralyn Sherman (hair and makeup design) and composers Robin Carolan (a frequent Björk collaborator) and Sebastian Gainsborough, contributing to the film’s harsh, unsettling sound design. All technical aspects are top notch and the script benefits from Sjón’s poetic air, suffusing the film’s supernatural aspects and some of the familial intrigue. The acting is terrific as well. While Hawke’s brief showing isn’t much (go watch him in Disney+’s’ Moon Knight!), and Willem Dafoe (half of The Lighthouse‘s two-handed cast) makes his usual creepiness effectively felt as a holy man/court jester, Skarsgård takes center stage here and holds nothing back. Lord knows what mindset he took to prepare for this violence-infused role, but it’s masterful. Not sure anyone’s making the bloodline connection between the film and True Blood, the HBO vampire series that propelled the Swedish Skarsgård to fame, but his character there was called Eric Northman. Perhaps there’s a distant relationship that some genealogist can unearth? And Kidman, of course, played the actor’s wife in the cable company’s Big Little Lies. Forget Wordle, you should play six degrees of separation. Most of the film is set in Iceland, but the pandemic forced the filmmakers to move most of the shoot to Northern Ireland. If there’s a sense of déjà vu for Game of Thrones, that’s because the film and the series both filmed in the same countryside locations. If you’re not having your senses bludgeoned by The Northman, you’ll admire all the historical detail and period madness. Fire and brimstone meet rot and decay, yet here’s ambition afoot here. Eggers deserves a great deal of the credit for crafting another startling, big screen vision."

When the inevitable storm hits, a small group washes ashore on a desert island. Wealth and beauty surrender to those with survival skills, and the balance of power radically shifts.

He leads a suitably eye-popping cast: stunning Margot Robbie; John David Washington; Robert De Niro, 79; Mike Myers, 59; Chris Rock, 57; and many more. While Amsterdam flashes back to WWI, it’s largely set in the 1930s, as veterans and compatriots Ben (Bale) and Harold (Washington) witness a socialite’s murder. Under suspicion themselves, they attempt to expose the real culprit. They gradually realize her death isn’t an isolated incident; there’s a fascist cult in lockstep with genocidal European tyrants intent on scrambling domestic democracy. From Oscar-winning showman David O. Russell, 64, there’s so much razzmatazz, artistry and comedic snap — yet the antic pastiche lacks a satisfying mystery plot and, sadly, is less than the sum of its amazing performances. —T.M.A. ​Talk about stirring the martini: Amazon celebrates James Bond’s 60th anniversary by streaming every Bond flick, from Dr. No to No Time to Die, on Prime Video. There’s also a documentary, The Sound of 007, and a recording of a charity concert of the Bond soundtracks, The Sound of 007: Live From the Royal Albert Hall, with special guests including “Goldfinger” singer Dame Shirley Bassey. If Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series about the Milwaukee cannibal, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, doesn’t slake your taste for psychological horror, try this three-part documentary, which explores the serial killer’s warped mind through his newly unearthed recorded interviews with his legal team, revealing the ways that race, sexuality, class and policing allowed him to prey on marginalized communities. We haven’t heard a whole lot from Girls creator Lena Dunham lately. But her adaptation of this 1994 best-selling novel, a medieval coming-of-age story about a young girl dodging her parents’ plans for her to marry, was well received at the Toronto Film Festival, so maybe all she needed to get her creative mojo back was a new setting (like, say, the 12th century). Our critics scanned the entire film catalog from the 1930s to now to handpick just 30 films that you must ­— must — see. We’re not talking about the best films (everyone does that list) but rather the films that are essential. You want to have seen these movies not just because they’re great (they are), but because they ensure you’re tuned into their cultural moments, the power of their time. So when someone makes a Philadelphia Story reference or deadpans, “the Dude abides,” you know exactly what they mean. It’s truly amazing how many incredible movies there are available on mainstream platforms like Amazon, Netflix and others. Our critics round up the very best for you, no matter what your interest. Check out the latest “Best of” lists from AARP critics. There’s never been a better time to catch up on movies you always intended to watch. Sigourney Weaver, 72, is staggeringly good: as in Hildy Good, a driven divorcée, mother of two grown daughters, and Realtor who survives from house sale to house sale. With a stiff upper lip, she puts on a brave and perfectly polished face. Snappy responses shoot out with a deflecting charm. But once her family stages an intervention, Good gradually realizes — after one blackout too many — that she doesn’t control the bottle; it controls her. Together with charmer Kevin Kline, 74, as her rustic high school sweetheart, the pair generate heat and heart connection in a mature sleeper that’s ultimately about the struggle to live an authentic life. The Good House dramatizes how alcohol, that demon brew, can take possession of a hardworking woman, her family and their collective future. There’s got to be a morning after, and Good ultimately confronts it with Yankee fortitude, lobster dinners and a front-row seat at A.A. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ok, maybe it’s time to worry, darling. High on her directorial debut, the delightful Booksmart, Olivia Wilde turned to Stepford Wives dystopian sci-fi. 1950s housewife Alice (magnificent Florence Pugh) makes a mean pot roast and a stiff martini. She shares a mid-century modern with husband Jack (pretty but bland teen idol Harry Styles), who returns daily from his workplace beneath a mysterious mountain and ravishes her in conjugal bliss. But there’s a crack in the dream: The next-door neighbor (KiKi Layne) freaks out; the big boss (a dapper Chris Pine) has messianic tendencies; and Alice starts to snoop at the fringes of the utopian community with dire consequences. The glossy, beautifully shot movie, swamped by incidental gossip about Wilde and Styles coupling on set and tension between her and Pugh, arrives with plenty of baggage; it’s a lot of buildup for a modest payoff. —T.M.A. Around 1995, filmmaker Tyler Perry, now 53, was a stone-broke nobody. He chanced to meet the legendary playwright August Wilson, who inspired him to write his own first screenplay, now at last a movie. It’s an August Wilson-ish melodrama about a shy 1930s Georgia musician (Joshua Boone) who falls for a beauty (Solea Pfeiffer) who passes for white. He becomes a hot Chicago musician, she marries a white racist. When they reunite in their small hometown in the 1940s, murder occurs. The movie is a mess, but ambitious and interesting, and less messy than the shambolic Madea comedies that made Perry a billionaire. The music scenes, from jumpin’ juke joint to ritzy nightclub, boasting tunes by Terence Blanchard and dances by Debbie Allen, are dazzling. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) Muscular and well oiled, Oscar winner Viola Davis, 57, vanquishes and vanquishes again as the emotionally and physically scarred General Nanisca, who cuts through rival tribes and European slavers in a war epic from Gina Prince-Bythewood, 53. Set in the 19th-century West African kingdom of Dahomey, this violent, female-driven history centers on the triumph of Nanisca’s women-only army, loyal to King Ghezo (an underused John Boyega). It’s also the tale of new recruit Nawi (The Underground Railroad’s outstanding Thuso Mbedu) and her journey under Nanisca’s critical eye from abused daughter to machete-wielding warrior. While the movie’s treatment is surprisingly conventional, the tale of women empowered to own their own bodies couldn’t be timelier. —T.M.A. Charming, happy-go-lucky and loose with the truth, Fletch, the title character of the late Gregory McDonald’s easily digestible crime series, has found joyous casting in Jon Hamm, 51. Opting not to pursue the slapstick route of the role’s previous star, Chevy Chase, 78, in Fletch (1985), Hamm’s Irwin M. “Fletch” Fletcher is easy on the eyes as the journalist-turned-sleuth. While investigating a kidnapping and art heist, Fletch is framed (pun intended) for a murder he couldn’t bother to have committed. Colorful characters abound: Kyle MacLachlan, 63, as a germaphobe art dealer; Roy Wood Jr., as a slow-but-steady barking police inspector; and Marcia Gay Harden, 63, going full Anna Magnani as a seductive countess intent on regaining her abducted husband’s priceless paintings. The result is a delightful Gordian knot of a mystery solved by a nutty guy who never breaks a sweat as he wisecracks through life while tripping over corpses. —T.M.A. No conventional music documentary could capture an artist as mercurial as David Bowie. So it’s good that director Brett Morgen, 53, banished the usual parade of talking head blowhards to, instead, turn his doc into a psychedelic swirl of sound and vision. The only voice you hear belongs to the artist himself, swiped from scores of vintage interviews. The quotes float over a dense collage of images from Bowie’s career that, once projected onto the looming screens of IMAX (it’s also in regular theaters), sweeps the viewer into an immersive dream. Contrary to the cliché of Bowie as the alien who fell to earth, his words present him as a man of urgent flesh who brought creativity, insight and awe to every living moment. —Jim Farber (J.F.) Loosely inspired by Bentley-driving Georgia prosperity-gospel preacher Eddie Long, sued by congregants for sexual misconduct, this dark semicomic mockumentary stars Sterling K. Brown as disgraced Pastor Childs, battling to revive his megachurch alongside his increasingly exasperated wife, Trinitie (Regina Hall). The plot is aimless, the writing clunky, but what carries the film is the incandescent performance of the supernal Hall as Trinitie, who covets a beaded spider-silk white hat, props up her errant man (“I would sooner kill him than leave him”), half-conceals eruptive emotions beneath a sweet façade, and whitens her face to do “praise mime” (which is a thing!). Brown is solid, but his character is muddled, and it’s Hall who shines, as does the vivid cast of parishioners and rival preachers. The arch, jokey fantasy is richly rooted in writer-director Adamma Ebo’s ambivalent love of Southern Baptist folkways: the wonderful church ladies’ outfits with serious hats, the troubled lives even a scamming pastor can inspire, the use of Bible verses as proof texts for self-serving purposes, the way “Bless your heart!” can convey seething contempt. It’s a messy film but a lively slice of life. —T.A. ​Sylvester Stallone, 76, can’t stop, won’t stop. If the legendary action star’s run with The Expendables franchise proved anything, it was that the actor still knew how to entertain audiences and demolish rivals unrestrained by age. OK, he may be creakier than in his Rocky days and, thankfully, those painful romantic subplots are a thing of the past. Here, he dips his toe into the world of superheroes as one of two mighty twins: Samaritan and Nemesis. Two decades after an explosion that allegedly eviscerated both, his character is recognized by a young boy who idolizes him (Javon “Wanna” Walton, Euphoria). Samaritan stomps out of retirement to protect the fan from bullies, and good old Red City from rampaging villains, led by the gleefully evil Cyrus (Pilou Asbaek, Game of Thrones). If you like a Stallone action pic, and giggling bad guys driving old muscle cars, this one’s for you. —T.M.A. Idris Elba is noted for arty fare (The Wire, Beasts of No Nation), but he’s terrific in this popcorn thriller about a widowed doctor who takes his realistically squabbling young daughters (Iyana Halley and Leah Sava Jeffries) to their late mom’s South African village for a safari, to connect them with her past. A lion enraged by poachers attacks their jeep, attempting to prevent their future. Director Baltasar Kormákur (Everest) consulted with the director of the superb The Revenant, which featured Leonardo DiCaprio’s hand-to-paw combat with a CG bear, to make his CG lion realistically menacing. Though The Revenant is a lot better — and this lion has a terrible sense of smell, unable to detect the doctor clinging to a limb right over its head — Beast delivers its jolts effectively. It’s 90 minutes well spent. Rogue Agent is a cunning, creepy fact-based thriller about a Ted Bundy–like serial con man. Played by the charming English actor James Norton, best known for his hot priest on PBS’s Grantchester, Robert Freegard is a sweet-faced devil — but make no mistake: He is a devil. The first bizarre act we see is Freegard’s convincing three college students that he’s an MI5 member, uprooting the trio in the middle of the night and deploying them on an undercover “mission” — really an act of kidnapping and extreme manipulation. He then seduces sharp-witted Alice Archer (ex-Bond girl Gemma Arterton). The lonely but chic-as-hell lawyer should know better but finds him irresistible enough to ignore his story’s inconsistencies, until she begins to dig into his past and gets dirt under her manicure. The true-crime tale, anchored by Norton and Arterton, is both classy and chilling on the windy road to the fiend’s comeuppance. —T.M.A. The payoff is worth the wait in Ron Howard’s 147-minute docudrama about the rescue of 12 members of a Thai boys soccer team and their coach from a flooded mountain cave — the basis of the terrific 2021 documentary The Rescue. This movie doesn’t tell us enough about the lads: Netflix secured their story rights for a miniseries. This Amazon Original film hopscotches among pressured public servants, frustrated families and heroic volunteers. But Howard pulls everything together when British cave divers (Colin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen) reach the kids and an Australian colleague (Joel Edgerton) hatches bold plans for their extraction. Legions of saviors, including Thai Navy SEALS, demonstrate the right stuff in scenes that are simultaneously spooky, poignant and thrilling. —Michael Sragow (M.S.) As Brad Pitt, 58, globe-trots promoting his latest action comedy, he’s breaking the male movie-star mold by wearing funky fashions: skirt sets (nice knees!) and shamrock-green suits. He’s equally loose and alive as “Ladybug,” an unlucky hired gun struggling to achieve work-life balance while pursuing a recon mission amidst four other assassins on Japan’s express train. Pitt’s surrounded by a dazzling cast of villains played by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, 61, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon and a sliver of Sandra Bullock, 58, all in fine form. The well-written movie hurtles along, bouncing between zingers and stingers, a runaway train of entertainment. Among the few summer blockbusters that demand theatrical viewing, leave it to Pitt (alongside Cruise, 60) to ensure that movie stars still have the potential to rule the box office — with the right vehicle, like a Bullet Train. —T.M.A. Jordan Peele owns the summer. Amid heat waves, he lures audiences back to air-conditioned theaters with a big, glossy, funny, gross, scary horror movie. A little bit Close Encounters, a little North by Northwest, Nope is nonstop entertainment. Working with Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya (his version of Cary Grant), Peele weaves a wild Western UFO tale. It follows a brother-of-few-words struggling to maintain the family’s Hollywood horse-wrangling business while a suspicious disc cruises above their inland California ranch. Joined by his fast-talking sister (a delightful Keke Palmer), an alien-obsessed techie (Brandon Perea), and a traumatized former child star (Steven Yeun), they battle to survive and capture the wily alien — on film. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard veteran character actor Michael Wincott, 64, as the dour cinematographer delivering the lyrics to Sheb Wooley’s 1958 “The Purple People Eater” in his gravelly voice. —T.M.A. Cinderella’s got nothing on Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville, 66), a widowed British housecleaner of a certain age with a dream: to own a fab frock by Dior. Though there’s a potential Prince Charming in her future, she’s the one who makes the dream happen, saving up to invade France’s haughtiest haute couture salon, guarded by formidable Mme. Colbert (Isabelle Huppert, 69, portraying a nicer version of the scary fashionista Manville got an Oscar nomination for playing in Phantom Thread). Once there, she charms all, befriends and advises young lovers, calms class warfare, wins the best dress, and overcomes heartbreak. It’s wispy fantasy, but lovable Manville and a winsome cast make it feel real. Need a mood boost right now? This is it.  —T.A. A giant of women’s fiction (12 million copies sold), Delia Owens’ novel Where the Crawdads Sing was plucked by Reese Witherspoon’s Book Club, and produced by her as a film. Naturalist Kya (Daisy Edgar-Jones) raises herself from wild child to womanhood in the North Carolina wetland, earning her the derogatory nickname Marsh Girl. Dumped by college-bound Tate (Taylor John Smith), she’s seduced by Chase (rising star Harris Dickinson). When Chase tumbles from a fire tower, Kya becomes the prime suspect. A cross between The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes and To Kill a Mockingbird (David Strathairn, 73, stars as Kya’s defense lawyer), the romance will satisfy fans of the book but suffers from abuse overload. Abandoned by her mother, siblings and drunken father, beaten and sexually assaulted, Kya’s defiance is admirable. But why create such a dynamic character only to make them fate’s piñata? —T.M.A. Baz Luhrmann’s best movie since his masterpiece Romeo + Juliet (1996) is brilliant but overlong, and Tom Hanks (65) masterfully wrestles with a flubbed role as con-man manager Colonel Tom Parker. But Austin Butler is an utter wonder as Elvis, and Baz is even better, frenetic yet nimbly precise, the camera leaping from Elvis belting the first rock hit, “That’s All Right,” to the child Elvis peeking at a Black singer performing the blues original in a wicked juke joint. Quick as a cricket, Baz’s dazzling cinematography conveys his subject’s roots in Black blues and gospel, and Gary Clark Jr., Kevin Harrison Jr., Yola, Shonka Dukureh and Alton Mason are superb as influencers Arthur Crudup, B.B. King, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Big Mama Thornton and Little Richard. Hanks does his best as Parker, narrating the King’s heroic, tragic arc while robbing and ruining him with carny marketing and god-awful films. Elvis balks when Parker tries to make him sing songs like “What Child Is This?” — Parker calls it “Whose Child Is This?” — in a cheesy Christmas special. But he permits Parker to imprison him in Vegas, doped up, instead of touring the world. Baz makes Parker almost nice, vague when the movie (and authenticity) need him to be vividly villainous. Still, you likely won’t see a more original film this year. —T.A. The charming YouTube-sensation short about a brave, inch-tall seashell (voiced by Jenny Slate) gets the full feature treatment, demonstrating a gigantic heart and an easygoing humor. The animated and live-action film follows the bighearted shell-on-sneakers as he navigates the disappearance in the night of a huge portion of his extended family, the diminishing abilities of his beloved immigrant Nana (the sly, moving vocal talent of Isabella Rossellini, 70) and a quest to recover his community with a little help from a heartbroken documentarian (the film’s director Dean Fleischer-Camp). Like wisehearted early Pixar films (Up), Marcel the Shell With Shoes On is a treat for the whole family, and a welcome respite from cynicism, sentimentality and anything-for-a-buck-ism. —T.M.A. Sometimes hard to watch but impossible to turn away from, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande tells the story of uptight, self-conscious widow Nancy Stokes (pitch-perfect Emma Thompson, 63), who hires smooth escort Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack, 29), hoping to find the adventurous sexual fulfillment lacking in her 31-year marriage. Nancy seems as if she’ll never be able let go of her fussbudget, retired teacher persona, even presenting Leo with a list of the sex acts she wants to tick off. But just when you think the film will end with Nancy abandoning herself to Leo’s confident charms, their antiseptic meetups take an abrupt, earthy turn. Nancy pries too much, and Leo’s self-assurance proves a mask concealing an interior as messy and sad as hers. Nancy has never had an orgasm, with herself or others. But their inauspicious coupling — however temporary — results in a happy ending for both. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Michelle Yeoh, 59, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, make beautiful movies together — and I hope to see them joined in everything from Westerns to crime thrillers. In this whacked-out, exuberant, multiple-timeline sci-fi actioner, Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a bedraggled Chinese immigrant living above the family laundromat with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, 50). While sandwiched between her cranky father, Gong Gong (James Hong, 93), and moody daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), she finds herself on the wrong side of IRS auditor Deirdre (Curtis in a crowd-pleasing, physically comic performance). In other words, she’s doing the everywoman juggle, except that in an outrageous series of multiverses, Evelyn has to dig deep, find her inner kung fu fighter, make peace with Joy (who often appears in outrageous costumes as her mother’s multiverse antagonist), Waymond and Gong Gong, and save the world. Spoiler alert: She succeeds — and global audiences will emerge feeling like winners, too. —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers is a brilliantly meticulous director. His first two films (""The Witch,"" and ""The Lighthouse"") were horror folk tales etched in such precise period detail, they lent weight and verisimilitude to the surreal tableaus they presented. In this way, the art was very much embedded in the craft. For a filmmaker whose fanaticism about minute detail -- down to the nails used in construction of his sets, and the crop seedlings in ""Witch"" -- borders on the psychopathic, there is an understanding that the effort put into such seemingly meaningless pedantries leads to more powerful effect, one wood-carved button, or jagged period-appropriate leaf, at a time. A producer might scoff at his fastidiousness, but, when this minutiae gets adhered to in such concentration, it joins into a cumulative effect for the viewer: Audiences might not be consciously aware of the weeks it took the costume designer to formulate the exact weave of yarn used by American pilgrims in the 16th century, but on a deeper level it registers fully, adding another layer of texture to an already formidable production. Eggers is, in this sense, certainly, an auteur; a director so obsessed with microns and dust motes, he needs exacting and total control of his process to achieve his desired result. What to do, then, when such a director has an idea for a film that's bigger and bolder than previous work -- with an expanded cast, hundreds of extras, and the re-creation of several entire ancient Nordic villages -- such that it requires the far deeper pockets of a major studio's financial reach? ""The Witch"" cost about $4 million, ""The Lighthouse"" more than double that, at $11 million. Eggers' latest work, ""The Northman,"" checks in with a budget of $90 million, and with the tremendous increase of financial backing, there comes new expectations. In this case, a big studio's demands that Eggers vision be put in service to a grander, more accessible scale. The director is already quoted as saying this sort of huge project is unlikely to be in his future efforts going forward, and after watching this would-be first-century Nordic opus, I would have to agree with his assessment. There's certainly nothing wrong with the foundational story, based on myth and folktale, that among many other things, inspired Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" In this original version, the miserable, haunted prince is Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), who, as a young boy (then played by Oscar Novak), watches in horror as his beloved father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is betrayed and murdered by his uncle, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), while his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), gets abducted by his father's killer. Barely escaping with his life, young Amleth pushes off a skiff into the North Sea, muttering a revenge-minded mantra: ""I will avenge you, father; I will save you, mother; I will kill you, Fjolner."" When next we see him, it is some years later, and the slender, innocent boy has grown into a snarling half-wild beast of a berserker, who tools around with his equally fierce wolf clan, and lays waste to small, unsuspecting villages. He still yearns for his revenge, however, so when he hears tell of a group of enslaved villagers being sent to a remote island where the now-deposed Fjolnir has taken residence, he hides among the slaves on the transport ship in order to get close to his sworn enemy. Along the brutal voyage, he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a white-blond witch, who uses Earth magic to, as she puts it, keep men bewildered. Upon arrival at his uncle's small compound in the hills, and taken in to the slave quarters, Amleth quickly begins plotting his terrible revenge. He first gains hold of the mystical Night Blade from deep in a fire-lit cave, and begins a secret, guerrilla campaign of fear, murder and humiliation upon the members of his remaining bloodline. With Olga's help, he wages unholy war upon the wicked and just alike, until he is given the choice between forsaking his endless hatred and bile and spending his life with Olga, or taking the Night Blade and driving it deep through Fjolnir's accursed soul. It is certainly a grand production. Shot on location in the British isles, the land is suitably pitiless and alluring, an eerie combination of spectacular rolling green hills and distant craggy mountains, and the noxious mud and filth of the day-to-day living of the inhabitants. Eggers, as always, utilizes folk myth as a deep psychological dig into the human psyche -- just why we, as terrified, ever-vulnerable creatures, voiced our richest fears and terrors in such tales in the first place, putting a name and form to a fear otherwise all-encompassing -- and the production design is suitably impressive and absorbing. But too many of those tiny elements that made Eggers' previous work so astounding have been mitigated here, likely a result of studio directives: The accents, for one thing, are all over the place, and the fact that the film is largely spoken in plain English diminishes much of its period detail (admittedly, it's a big ask of American moviegoers to endure a film of subtitles, but it makes so little sense to have the characters speaking in a non-native tongue, one imagines it would have been worth it). Skarsgard, looming and filled with menace, fits the physical model, but offers little of the anguish and haunted nature of the character in an oddly disaffected performance. Bang and Hawke are far more adept at capturing the grandiosity of their roles, and Kidman is equally effective, but having your lead misfire in such a way almost certainly dooms the project. There are also numerous more mystical bits, the Viking Tree of the Kings is evoked repeatedly, as Amleth's dreams of Valkyries and Valhalla flit about. Eggers makes good use of the primordial caves, deep in the consciousness of his characters -- literally, in this case, as Amleth plunges into such submerged earthy confines, both with his father, meeting the sage madness of Heimir (Willem Dafoe) as lit by firelight deep underground; and, later, in order to earn the Night Blade -- but other than those inspired moments, where we can suppose Eggers' imagination was allowed to run more free, the film feels oddly flat, mitigated as it is by the cross purposes of its creator and the studio that backed it. It brings to mind ""Eternals,"" the MCU film from last fall, helmed by an equally brilliant indie director, Chloe Zhao. There, too, given the strict parameters of the Marvel way, Zhau's film felt ill-formed, an unsatisfying hybrid of MCU bombast, and her measured, environment-based approach. What makes Eggers' work so special is precisely the singularity of his vision, the clarity of his purpose, which is why seeing such a grand misfire feels, in retrospect, very easy to have predicted, like Yasujiro Ozu making ""Ben Hur,"" or Zack Snyder shooting ""Before Sunrise."" There is a great deal to admire here, but much less to get moved by.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,The Northman envelopes its conventional swords-and-sandals plot with a vibe and aesthetic that is both unhinged and seductive.
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Production designer-turned-director Robert Eggers (“The Witch,” “The Lighthouse”), who co-wrote his latest “The Northman” with Icelandic author Sjon (“Lamb”), has been more adept at memorable visuals and dense atmospherics than storytelling, and his latest will do nothing to alter that impression. A fictionalized origin story for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” “The Northman” is the splatter “Hamlet” with no connection to Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, Shakespeare’s source. “The Northman” begins in 895 with narration about “the Norns,” “Odin the all-father,” Yggdrasil “the King of Trees” and the sounds of drums, horns and Viking throat-singing. We drink it all in. Young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) walks in on his beautiful mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) dressing and experiences a barking-mad initiation rite with his beloved father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) in scenes combining equal parts Joseph Campbell and Timothy Leary. After the murder of his father by his uncle Fjolnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang, “The Square”), Amleth evades capture and grows up to be a berserker (6-foot-4-inch-plus Alexander Skarsgard), wearing a wolf’s head as a hat and raiding a Slavic village. When he learns that captive slaves will be sent to King Fjolnir and Queen Gudrun, who married her husband’s murderer, Amleth disguises himself as a — very large — captive and seeks his vengeance against Fjolnir in Iceland. This vengeance takes the seeming form of a blood sacrifice to dark demon gods. After one night of killing, Amleth leaves a blood-splattered frieze made out of butchered bodies tied against a wooden wall. Set in a world with a smoking volcano in the background, “The Northman” is very often over the top. It’s an Icelandic “The Green Knight” with chapter headings in the twig-like Old Norse Runic script of the sagas and eddas. The dialogue can land like a grenade of Nordic phlegm. Amleth falls in love with the Slavic captive Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy of Eggers’ “The Witch”). After the mess that was “Last Night in Soho,” you’d hope the talented Taylor-Joy (“The Queen’s Gambit”) would catch a break. But having to introduce yourself as “Olga of the Birch Forest” would be tough even for Olivia Colman. Who’s that bad guy with a missing nose? In a hot spring, Amleth and Olga bathe and pledge their troth. Amleth continues to wreak havoc, cutting down Fjolnir’s followers every night. Willem Dafoe of Eggers’ “The Lighthouse” shows up as Heimer the Fool, more Viking kitsch. A big scene involving a game with cudgels and a ball is quidditch for psychos. You will recall that Skarsgard played Kidman’s husband in “Big Little Lies.” Let’s face it. The kid is just not as great as his father, Stellan. None other than Bjork herself appears as a seeress with three eyes and enough accessories to choke a horse. Speaking of horses, “The Northman” boasts scenes with many extras and horses that were reportedly a nightmare to film, requiring multiple takes, unlike CGI. You want to cut a break for a filmmaker willing to go to such lengths. The big “Excalibur”-like, final sword fight is shot against the backdrop of that volcano erupting. Symbolically, “The Northman” is a Freudian freak show. “Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree,” some mocking Viking says of Christians. “The Northman” has a Valkyrie with braces on her teeth. Scream, Odin."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," The Nut Graf: “The Northman” (in theaters, ***1/2 stars out of ****) shows a gifted and confident young director flexing his muscles. “Petite Maman” (in theaters, **** stars out of ****) is a translucent fable of mothers and daughters. “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” (in theaters, ** stars out of ****) is like that M.C. Escher print of two hands drawing each other, only with Nicolas Cage. “Love and Friendship” (2016, Amazon Prime, ***1/2 stars out of ****) remains a delightful bonbon of wit and malice, courtesy of Jane Austen and Whit Stillman. “The Northman” is authentic atavistic cinema, a bulletin from the before times fashioned by one of the great natural filmmakers of the present. Robert Eggers is one of those precision madmen of the movies who disappears down rabbit holes of research and resurfaces with pure cinema; like Hitchcock and the Coens, it’s all in his head before it ever goes before the camera. His 2015 feature debut, “The Witch” spun a distressing tale of early American Puritanism and demonic possession, and the light at its center was the discovery of the young Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead. Eggers’ 2019 follow-up, “The Lighthouse,” stuck Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe on an isolated island and uncorked the insanity; I thought the first hour was brilliant and the second hour a splattery mess, but I have been informed by my grown children that the film is considered one of the great works of their generation. Both those movies were made in contained settings with small casts. “The Northman” is Eggers’ grab at the brass ring: It feels huge. Set in the early Tenth Century of Northern Europe, it tells the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, above), a Viking warrior thirsting to avenge the murder of his father the king (Ethan Hawke) by his power-hungry uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who has subsequently married the widowed Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Wait, doesn’t that sound a lot like “Hamlet”? It is “Hamlet” – or rather, it’s derived from the same medieval Icelandic legend from which Shakespeare drew inspiration. Returning to its source (or sources), “The Northman” hopes to reinvigorate the tale and recover its primal power. Does it work? By diving into the grit, the grime, and the gore of the legend and by generally turning the amps up to 11, “The Northman” succeeds, both because and in spite of its willingness to dance on the volcano rim of the absurd. The attention to historical detail is fetishistic, with clothes and architecture and attitudes that feel as though they’ve been unearthed from the peat bogs. The violence is true to the period, and it’s feral with testosterone, not celebrated so much as coldly observed. I happened to see the movie a day or two after the revelation of the Russian Army massacres in Bucha, Ukraine, and there’s a savage Viking assault on a village early in the film that was more difficult to watch than the director may have intended. Or maybe not. The innocent are not spared in this movie, and to pretend otherwise would be lying. We are meant to wince in our comfortable seats. And then we’re meant to cheer Amleth on as he pursues his vengeful slaughter, pretending to be a captured slave so that he’ll be taken to Iceland and to his uncle, who won’t recognize the hulking berserker now working his fields as the boy he’d been told had been killed years before. Or are we meant to look on Amleth’s quest with a more jaundiced eye? A love interest arrives in the person of another slave, a wide-eyed blond who introduces herself as “Olga of the Birch Forest,” which does sound a little like the manager of an upscale day spa, so you’re allowed a discreet snicker. But Olga – this movie’s version of Shakespeare’s Ophelia – is played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who since her appearance seven years ago in “The Witch” has become a star (via “The Queen’s Gambit” on Netflix, among other things) and toughened up as an actress. Both she and Kidman as the traitorous queen know that their characters are much, much smarter than any of the men here – they’re women, they have to be – and through them Eggers lets us see Amleth’s musclebound naiveté.  For all its melodramatic macho overkill, “The Northman” plays a tightly controlled game in which the audience roots for revenge while seeing its folly. In other words, “Conan the Barbarian” this ain’t, although “The Northman” will probably find a warm welcome among the alt-right bro crowd who will cheer its surface chest-beating without stopping to examine the ironies beneath. And while it’s sharper and weirder than any episode of “Game of Thrones,” tender souls of both sexes and all political persuasions may find it overheated or laughable or thuggish. There will be severe misreadings of this movie, a cultural phenomenon that is hardly Eggers’ fault, since he’s made exactly the epic of primitive glory and violent pigheadedness he seems to have wanted. He’s a throwback to the 1970s, when directors rolled the dice and risked their lives on lunatic projects, and there are long shots in “The Northman” where I could swear I was watching one of Werner Herzog’s bonkers early dioramas. And then I remembered that Robert Eggers is his own man and has his own future ahead of him. It will be something to see. If that’s just too much red meat for you, feel free to seek out “Petite Maman,” from Celine Sciamma (“Portrait of a Lady on Fire”). A festival favorite, it’s being released in New York and L.A. today and will roll out to Boston and other markets next week – in time for Mother’s Day, appropriately. I’ve already written about this slender miracle – only 72 minutes long – when I saw it as part of the Toronto Film Festival and in my year-end roundup of best movies, so I’ll just add that Sciamma’s warm, intimate focus on female characters and their interrelationships takes on magical-realist shadings in this modern-day fairy tale of a little girl who goes into the woods one day and meets her own mother as a girl. Twin sisters Joséphine and Gabrielle Sanz play the leads, and the film stakes out a very special sphere of friendship, forgiveness, and understanding. “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” is I guess where Nicolas Cage has been heading for a decade or two now: A Very Meta Nicolas Cage Movie that acknowledges he’s a pop culture joke and that he’s also in on the joke and that he’s also an actor of strange and powerful gifts. (See: “Mandy” and/or “Pig.”) Here he plays a declining Hollywood star named Nick Cage, so neurotic, narcissistic, and obsessive-compulsive that he’s alienated his agent (Neil Patrick Harris), his wife (Sharon Horgan of TV’s “Catastrophe”), and his teenage daughter (Lily Sheen, daughter of Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen and thus blessed with a frighteningly impeccable British acting genome). Deep in debt, Cage (or “Cage”) agrees to travel to Mallorca for a rich man’s birthday party, but the rich man, Javi (Pedro Pascal), has a screenplay he wants Cage to star in and he might be an international arms dealer and there’s a pair of CIA agents (Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz) who enlist the actor in an undercover mission and … you get the point. It’s a movie about Nicolas Cage that becomes a Nicolas Cage movie. With its intertextual references to the actor’s deep cuts (“Guarding Tess”! “The Croods II”! “Not the bees!” ) and long discussions between Nick and Javi about the movie they want to make – which is, get this, the movie we’re watching – it’s all very clever but only clever, and it swipes ideas from other, better Cage movies, like the imaginary alter ego that’s been airlifted in from “Adaptation.” I dunno – Pascal is great comic company and the movie’s good for a guilt-free watch when it comes to cable or VOD. The star enters enthusiastically into the self-abasing spirit of the thing and if you’re a Cage completist, I suppose you’ll want that notch on your belt. But, really, you might be better off watching 1988’s “Vampire’s Kiss,” perhaps the first indication of how truly unhinged this actor could get and one of the most misunderstood movies of its era. (It’s available for rent on Apple TV.) Or “Knowing” (2009), which may be my secret favorite Nicolas Cage movie because I can’t decide whether it’s crazy terrible or crazy inspired and nothing in the star’s hoarse, apocalyptic, deeply committed lead performance offers a clue. Someday we’re going to stand around the beautiful smoking crater of this actor’s filmography and marvel that we were alive to watch it happen. If you’re not up to going out to the theaters and would rather curl up at home with a good movie, may I suggest 2016’s “Love & Friendship,” streaming exclusively on Amazon Prime? It’s the best Jane Austen adaptation you’ve probably never heard of, from a Jane Austen novella you’ve also probably never heard of, and it gives Kate Beckinsale a deliciously conniving role as a widow on the prowl for a new rich husband. Whit Stillman (“Metropolitan”) directs and he’s as good as his name; for my money, this is the wittiest Austen ever put on screen. Plus there’s a riotous performance by Tom Bennett as an upper class twit — if they gave an Oscar for Best Idiot in a Movie, he’d have won in a landslide. Man oh man. A trove of riches and a lunatic dancing on the edge of disaster. Oh, wait: two lunatics dancing on the edge of disaster. I'm really digging Eggers and Cage committing up to and past the point of reason. I miss the 70s. And now have to balance all the lunacy out with ""Petite Maman"" and ""Love & Friendship."" Too bad it's not a long weekend. Thanks, Mr. Burr."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Nicole Kidman plays a Norse queen whose husband is murdered and who ends up married to the murderer, her former brother-in-law. In Hamlet, she’d be Gertrude, but in the The Northman, which takes for its source material the brawnier, grislier legend on which the Shakespeare play is based, she’s named Gudrún, and she’s slung over the shoulder of her still-bloody new spouse Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and carried off as the spoils of fratricide. Watching from a hiding spot, her young son Amleth adds to the murderous to-do list as he flees into the night muttering, “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” And yet, when he makes his way back to Gudrún as an adult played by a hulking Alexander Skarsgård, Amleth is thrown to discover that his mother appears to be happy with Fjölnir, with whom she’s since had a son. She challenges Amleth’s assumption that it was Fjölnir she needed to be rescued from, showing him the slave brand on her chest and taunting him for believing his parents’ marriage was actually the fairy-tale joining of noble families he’d been told. Kidman’s a scream in The Northman, and in a revisionist take on its tale, Gudrún would be a tragic feminist anti-heroine trying to engineer a life she wants from her unwilling perch in a society shaped around what she describes as savagery. But in this film, she’s practically demonic in that moment, a degenerate flying in the face of the particular Viking social order Amleth has dedicated himself to restoring. It’s not that her desires are unsympathetic — on the contrary, Gudrún, with her thoughts on good leadership and her desire to choose a caring mate, may be more relatable than any other character in the film. But relatability is the last thing on The Northman’s mind. The film is the third from writer-director Robert Eggers, who shares a screenplay credit here with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón. And like Eggers’s previous work, it’s interested in not just re-creating the details and texture of a past era but also its way of thinking. The Northman is a gloriously ruthless saga involving sorcery, the immutability of fate, sackings and stormy journeys at sea and a nude sword fight in the shadow of a volcano. But its most notable quality is the way it refuses to bend its characters to the present, preferring instead to make them as alien in their perspective as possible. The Northman doesn’t invite its viewers into its world, but instead dares them to try to catch up. There’s an inevitable distancing effect to this approach, though that’s refreshing into itself. Eggers’s debut feature, The Witch, strove to re-create the world as seen by its Puritan colonists — not just in the minutiae of their desperate efforts to carve survival for themselves out of the unforgiving wilderness, but in their certainty that the Devil was real and present and actively working against them in tangible ways. The Northman may be about the familiar motivation of revenge, but it’s even more remote in its belief system. Amleth’s father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), talks about how shameful it would be to grow old instead of dying in battle and ascending to Valhalla. Amleth is named his successor in a ceremony in which he pretends to be a dog, laps up a hallucinogenic potion, and sees a vision of his ancestors’ bodies hanging from a tree. As a grimy grown-up striated with muscles and with shoulders so broad they seem to weigh him down — no one has ever been more born for a role than Skarsgård was for this one — Amleth becomes a berserker, slaughtering his way with unpretty skill through a Rus village, then meandering indifferently through the aftermath of raping and pillaging like a retail worker who’s finally off the clock. When he encounters a seeress played by Björk, one of several witches he meets along the way, she reasonably points out that he’s been terrorizing her people and then reminds him of his avowed mission anyway, as though his fate were simply bigger than the day-to-day lives of the villagers being rounded up to be sold for labor. “These savages make for fine chattel,” Amleth’s cohort observes in one of the screenplay’s balder moments. Savagery is in the eye of the beholder, and The Northman is fiercely committed to rooting itself in a particular perspective, even when Amleth meets a wily Rus captive, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who becomes his ally and his lover. When so much recent media has bent history to accommodate more modern points of view, there’s something spectacular about Eggers’s refusal to soften his protagonist in any way or to have him learn the sort of lessons a 2022 story demands. You don’t need to understand Amleth’s values to invest in his brutal journey, which is filled with heart-pounding set pieces and unabashed badassery — I was partial to the moment he casually catches a spear hurled down at him from the battlements and then tosses it back. The Northman benefits from surrendering to that sense of remove, to its hero’s unforgiving understanding of the universe having been created to reward violence. You wouldn’t want to see him striding up to the walls of your settlement, but hard-core moments like the one in which Amleth disguises himself as a slave are easy to appreciate. He doesn’t just pick up an iron from the fire and use it to brand his own skin; he mutters to the tool that, should he meet its owner, “I will thank him for the warmth you gave to me.” Metal!"
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Worried that Shakespeare’s Hamlet isn’t gory enough? Have no fear. Director Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse) is on the case with, The Northman. Taking the ancient Norse myth of Amleth and giving it the violent cinematic treatment it deserves, recalling Zack Snyder’s 300 and George Lucas’ Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith—albeit with greater artistry than either—Eggers creates a powerful meditation on toxic masculinity that masquerades as a tale of filial revenge. There’s blood, sinew, muscles, and entrails, all of it beautifully photographed against the stark majesty of Iceland. Forget fire and ice (though there is that, too); revel instead in arterial spray. What more could you ask for? It’s AD 895, and times are tough. The hulking Alexander Skarsgård (Passing) stars in the title role, though before we get to him we meet young Amleth as played by Oscar Novak (who also plays young Bruce Wayne in the recent The Batman), son to King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke, The Truth) and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, Boy Erased). Mom pampers him, but it’s dad who fascinates, and in a sequence with the court jester (Willem Dafoe, The Florida Project) we see father and boy join souls (thanks to some trusty hallucinogens) on the Norse tree of life, Yggdrasil. Unfortunately, it’s right after that close bonding that Aurvandil is killed by his own brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang, The Square). Vikings may be ruthless conquerors, but sometimes they eat their own.  Fjölnir’s plan of succession includes removing his nephew, but the boy proves cunning and swift and gets away, only to reappear “years later” (as the title card explains) as Skarsgård. He’s now as bloodthirsty as anyone, perhaps more so, and in a graphic scene helps his adopted clan wipe out an entire town. It’s as the victors are enjoying the spoils that he hears once more of Fjölnir, whose stolen kingdom was soon stolen again, only this from Fjölnir. Now residing on Iceland, he has ordered himself some new slaves, to be culled from the freshly defeated souls from the latest attack. Throwing away his clothes, grabbing rags of the newly indentured, and cutting his long locks, Amleth jumps aboard a vessel bound for Fjölnir, a plan slowly hatching in his fevered mind. That plan includes many a mystic vision, with wizards and witches (one of whom is Björk) appearing at intervals to propel Amleth on his crimson path. Many will die, but not without cost to our hero, who himself is no saint. Far from it. For though he finds redemption of a sort in the arms of fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, Emma.), a smart survivor who becomes his helpmate, he is at heart a killer through and through, not much different than Fjölnir. Nor, as it turns out, from his mother. There are surprises in store, though anyone familiar with the misadventures of Shakespeare’s Dane will know a little bit of how it all must end. There is no outcome but death when death is all one has mastered. Men are beasts, and they don’t need the wolfskins they occasionally don to prove it. The climactic battle, set against volcanic flow, is a great set piece of out-of-control machismo. Destruction rules, and it is beautiful to behold. Somewhere else, life goes on (courtesy of Olga), but up on center stage stands the apotheosis of savagery, magnificent and terrible. The fire burns painfully, but it’s hard to look away.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Based on a piece of Norse mythology that inspired William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Robert Egger’s brutal, mud-splattered Viking saga The Northman showcases the talented The Witch and The Lighthouse filmmaker at the top of his creative game. This is a suitably violent revenge epic, one overflowing in striking imagery and impressionistic flights of surrealist fancy that frequently impress. But the film, as strong as it may be, is equally not always the sum of its impressive parts, the overall simplicity of its story making the 136-minute running time noticeably onerous. A sensory triumph more than it is an emotional one, this is nonetheless an enthralling endeavor, everything building to a crushing finale of senseless masculine bravado that’s as gut-wrenchingly beautiful as it is tragically heartbreaking. For two decades Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has been living in seclusion in the hopes he will return to his homeland to avenge the death of his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir The Brotherless (Claes Bang) and rescue his kidnapped mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). When he learns that the clan has moved to a desolate stretch of Iceland, living in the shadow of a malevolent volcano, Amleth smuggles aboard a ship and disguises himself as a slave slated to work on his uncle’s farm. While there he joins forces with the beautiful Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a cunning Slavic slave who claims to have the power to warp the minds of men. The two quickly fall in love, their unbridled passion forcing Amleth to reconsider his plans for revenge. Costing a reported $90-million, every dollar of the production budget is up on the screen. Egger and his crack technical team, most notably production designer Craig Lathrop (The Empty Man), costume designer Linda Muir (Exotica), and director of photography Jarin Blaschke (Down a Dark Hall), have done an exquisite job of breathing life into this 10th-century world. The film also features unsettlingly flawless sound design, seamless visual effects, and a masterful score, composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough delivering musical compositions that euphorically reverberate from one corner of the auditorium to the other. All the same, those expecting a brawny Viking-era twist on 1982’s Conan the Barbarian or 1958’s The Vikings will have another thing coming. While the violence is harsh, the swordplay fierce, the nudity rampant, and the action furious, Eggers is by nature an introspective filmmaker who likes to take his time. He attempts to get to the nuts and bolts of a character and find the byzantine quirks that make them tick. Along with his co-writer, the famed Icelandic author Sjón (Lamb), the director wants the viewer to feel drenched in the same mud, guts, and feces Amleth often finds himself covered in. Eggers wants this world to come alive. He wants his audience to live inside of it the same way all of his characters are. Even the fantastical bits, the flights of metaphorical supernatural fancy where the angry, vengeance-seeking prince learns more about his fate from an ethereal witch-like creature (stunningly brought to life by Björk in an all-too-brief cameo) are played with cold solemnity. But while this does allow Eggers the freedom to make this world concrete and authentic in a manner a more salicaceous presentation never could, it also creates a strange distancing effect that lessens the emotional connection between the viewer and what is transpiring in the theater. This is unfortunate because the melodrama is ripely theatrical in ways that should be inherently gripping. This is a larger-than-life world populated by even bigger characters. For Amleth, nothing in Fjölnir’s kingdom is what he expected it was going to be. While he is willing to kill just about anyone – especially those standing in his way of achieving his ultimate goal – circumstances regarding both his new love Olga and his kidnapped mother Gudrún suddenly have him second-guessing himself. But while the performances are outstanding, Kidman and an unrecognizable Bang are particularly strong, I can’t say I grew attached to any of these people long enough to care about who would live or who would die. Save for a shocking moment near the end transpiring minutes before the savage climax between Amleth and Fjölnir hacking it out to the death wearing nothing but their birthday suits at the base of the volcano, nothing here caused me to gasp. Each narrative beat was oddly perfunctory, and that this isn’t fatally problematic is a testament to Egger’s directorial skill as well as the confident determination of his talented all-star ensemble. Is the movie worth seeing? Yes. Unquestionably. I can say that with zero hesitation. Yet, even though a visual marvel that is also a primal, poetic journey into the ancient past, Eggers’ latest still failed to engage with me the same way his two previous, equally ambitious cinematic endeavors did. I’m enamored with large chunks of The Northman, and I do urge interested parties to give it a look, but whether or not I’ll choose to give it another go myself is an open question I’m at the moment unwilling, maybe even unable, to truthfully answer.

"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Psychological probing is squashed, like many onscreen skulls. It all leads to a slog of a saga of slaughter. "
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," In 2017, Nicole Kidman was married to Alexander Skarsgård in HBO’s “Big Little Lies.” Five years later, she’s playing his mom in “The Northman.” Just another reminder that in Hollywood, age is just a number…for men to use against women. Anyway, let’s get to why you’re really here: Yes, Willem Dafoe does appear in both a Viking-era dog costume and in his underpants and as a disembodied head. It’s all true. Writer/director Robert Eggers has made largely inert, widely beloved feature films: “The VVitch” and “The Lighthouse.” “The IVorthman” completes his “The” trilogy. None of the three say anything original or interesting. All are well made. If you liked his first two and have no strong objection to Oedipal urges, strap on your umlaut and buckle up your Björk for a Norse by Norse-west tale of vengeance and volcanos. As a child, Prince Amleth watches the murder of his daddy, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), at the hands of his brother, Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang). Fjölnir’s last name is kind of a spoiler but also makes me wonder what my last name would be in the world of “The Northman.” Ryan the Carpal Tunneled? Anyway, itty bitty Amleth presumably does nothing but exercise his core muscles for two decades or so and then seeks revenge for his father and to free his mother, Queen Gudrún the Freudian Nightmare (Kidman). Amleth gets a few prophecies from Björk, who is presumably not playing herself here, and a character named He-Witch (Ingvar Sigurdsson). He meets up with Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who maybe does magic? Mostly she just spreads her fingers wide and her eyes wider and chants. Olga and Amleth end up slaves at Fjölnir’s compound, and that’s where the killin’ starts. Eggers and his cowriter Sjón narratively don’t get much further than the standard “dig two graves” warning about revenge. Maybe there’s a basic intro to the perils of cyclic, inherited toxic masculinity here? Even then, chances are that if you have truck nuts on your vehicle because your dad gave them to you as a Christmas gift, you aren’t going to learn much from a movie in which a woman repels a rapist with her menstrual blood. “The Northman” is pretty. As jarring as that sentence is after the previous one, that’s exactly what it’s like to watch the film: the grotesque bumps right up against the beautiful. Eggers is clearly most at home with the weird, dark moments that clearly unsettled the people who gave him tens of millions of dollars, thinking they had the next “Braveheart” or “Gladiator” on their hands. The film is caught somewhere between popular violent historical fiction and whatever the genre is where Ethan Hawke burps in Willem Dafoe’s face. That said, kudos to Eggers for trying to make an epic blockbuster in his style. We should all want to see our generation’s most renowned artists play in the biggest sandbox, with the most toys possible. It’s not our money, and better this than “Oreos: The Movie” or whatever nonsense “intellectual property” adaptation lies in wait for us next. Catalina Combs of Black Girl Nerds says “This film is a wild good time, even with the dark, violent, and bloody scenes. It’s been a minute since we had something like it. It’s bold, gritty, and just downright awesome.”"
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"Its a rarity in todays IP-saturated cinematic climate that a director like Eggers is permitted to take this wild a swing, and even rarer that their major studio debut feels so of a piece with their earlier works."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"The emotional connection meanders, but the production and Skarsgard's physical performance fly sky-high."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman--The hero of this historical epic is Amleth, a 9th-Century Nordic prince whose father is murdered by his brother, who then marries Amleth's mother. Amleth flees, vowing revenge. When he's all grown up into the strapping Alexander Skarsgård and enjoying a nice career as a raiding, ravaging berserker, he travels to Iceland, poses as a slave on the estate of his Uncle (Claes Bang)--who's still married to Amleth's seemingly contented Mom (Nicole Kidman)--and waits for the chance to avenge his Dad. Yeah, sort of. The Amleth legend, as recorded in the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus in the 12th Century, is the root that, greatly refined by time and civilization, ultimately grew into Shakespeare's Hamlet. But director Robert Eggers, who wrote the script with the Icelandic poet and novelist known as Sjön, prefers to take the story of fratricide punished back to the raw source material. This is, on the whole, a serious attempt at a historically and mythically accurate depiction of the Middle Ages. That's not to say that it's always an accurate depiction of daily reality in those times, but the movie tries to be true to the era's imaginative and moral sensibilities. As such, it's a seriously harsh, bloody, gory, nasty tale. It offers us almost no quarter, and asks none of us. For that, it has to be respected. Not many big-budget period movies are this unwilling to throw a sop to modern attitudes. These characters aren't just 21st-century people dressed in Viking drag; when, say, helpless peasants (including children) are locked in a hall that's set on fire after a battle, Amleth isn't the perpetrator, but he doesn't stop it, or object to it, or even seem to notice it. It's just another day at the barbarian office. The acting is strong. Skarsgård is capable and appealing as Amleth, Anya Taylor-Joy feels period-authentic as the enslaved woman he comes to love, Kidman has an impressive, almost Shakespearean bearing as the Mom. Ethan Hawke as Amleth's Dad and Willem Dafoe as a lippy jester are both effective, and Björk has a creepy scene as a prophet. Best of all is Claes Bang, who wisely plays the murdering brother as a sensible, reflective man. Despite all this creditable work, what with mutilated servants, and the horses with severed heads, and plenty of other atrocities, the list of people who will prefer to take a pass on The Northman is likely to be long. Even on it's own terms, it's a little slow, and a little heavy, although it gathers steam as it goes, and by the time we get to the final showdown--in the midst of a volcanic eruption!--it's entirely engrossing. The movie also comes across--unintentionally, I think--as a little, well, Aryan. If you aren't in the mood to watch a lot of stripped-down white guys screaming into the camera as they psych themselves up for battle, this may not be the flick for you. This behavior is historically accurate, of course, and again, I don't think for a moment that it was what Eggers and Sjön had in mind, but it's too easy to imagine a bunch of skinheads or Proud Boys watching this movie over and over, and nodding along with the rage."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman features a sequence revolving around what could be described as a game of medieval Scandinavian Quidditch, the rules of which are vague but involve scoring by winging a ball off a stake of wood. More important than the ball or the stake or the score, however, is the amount of violence you can inflict upon the other team, as we see when the whole thing culminates in one man literally headbutting another man to death. How much you enjoy The Northman depends upon how neat such a cranial bludgeoning sounds to you. Robert Eggers’s latest picture luxuriates in the barbarism of the distant past; this is a world of sacked villages and enslaved peoples, one in which children are consigned to a hut and burned alive rather than being allowed to become a burden to the victors. It’s a world of magic and visions, of witches and fools, of Valkyries and Valhalla. The action begins with the return of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) to his home. Wounded in battle, he is greeted by his wife, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and young son Amleth (Oscar Novak). After some bonding and a vision quest led by court jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe), Aurvandil is betrayed and murdered by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also attempts to slay young Amleth. This being a tale of vengeance in addition to one of medieval Scandinavian Quidditch, Amleth survives, flees, and grows up to become Alexander Skarsgård, whose defining features are traps the size of beachballs and the viciousness of a wolf. On the way to claiming his vengeance, he falls in love with Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the two of them set out to make the life of Fjölnir and his clan miserable. The Northman calls to mind Conan the Barbarian in the sense that it’s about a prince who, after his father is slain, gets jacked and learns the sweet art of murder in order to take vengeance upon the people who wronged him. Conan by way of Shakespeare—rearrange the name Amleth ever-so-slightly and we’re dealing with a fairly famous Danish prince—with a dash of The Green Knight thrown in for good measure. There’s no shortage of testosterone—violence, righteous and otherwise, is the coin of this realm—and every third scene we’re treated to visions, be they of combat with mound-dwelling demons guarding a mystical sword or witches relaying prophecies that condemn Amleth to a fiery fate on the rim of a volcano. It’s a slightly strange movie, is what I’m getting at in my roundabout way. Eggers is no stranger to slightly strange movies. Sometimes that works out, as it did with The Witch, his transfixing radicalization narrative; sometimes it’s a bit of a wank, as it was with The Lighthouse. Regardless, there’s a purity of vision you have to respect and plenty of style to go with it. Eggers has a fondness for shots that, essentially, turn the camera in a circle or part of a circle, 90, 180, 360 degrees, giving us a sort of disconcerting all-around view, a reminder that everything changes when you shift perspectives slightly. A literalizing of the phrase “head on a swivel,” perhaps. I don’t think I’m risking my reputation too badly here by predicting there will be a fairly large gap between critics (who are drawn to The Northman precisely because it is unusual) and audiences (many of whom will be repelled for precisely the same reason). But if you’re looking for an unapologetically bloody and masculine movie with just a dash of eerie energy to it, you’ll probably dig The Northman."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL," Ads and trailers for The Northman suggest a ferocious Viking epic. There are scenes of intense action, some staged against dramatic backdrops, that will please those who find most mainstream action films too tame. While director and co-screenwriter Robert Eggers has a bigger budget and recognizable stars, he has not abandoned the sensibilities that made The Witch and The Lighthouse popular among genre aficionados. Parts of The Northman can be deliberate, even ponderous, because Eggers trusts his audience to be curious about his revisionist approach to Norse mythology. Unfortunately, sometimes that trust can be naïve or misguided. You may recall that Amleth, the hero of The Northman, is an inspiration for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” Both stories share the same basic structure: Amleth is a boy when his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) murders his father (Ethan Hawke), then marries his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Time passes, then Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth as a man, a warrior with a boundless desire for vengeance. The simple structure allows Eggers and his co-writer, the Icelandic poet Sjón, to delve into values and structure of medieval society in northern Europe. There are hallucinatory scenes that suggest literal transformation and a complicated sense of honor are what motivate Amleth and his father (shortly before his death, he expresses his desire to die on a battlefield). Since Amleth receives visits from multiple spirits, Eggers complicates the revenge tale. It is not enough to kill Fjölnir; he must do it properly. In order to bide his time, the film has a long middle act where he effectively shares Hamlet’s propensity for indecision. Upon learning his uncle’s whereabouts, Amleth poses as a slave and is sold into Fjölnir’s custody. He does not escape and raise an army, and before he begins terrorizing his captors, there are long stretches where we wait and wait for something to happen. He must obtain a proper weapon, for example, and he strikes up a romance with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave. Without the context of the Amleth legend of Eggers’ other films, this narrative slowdown is a bait and switch. There is only one major battle scene – impressively staged to appear as a single shot – and most of the other (infrequent) action deals in abstraction, not careful choreography.  When the film drags, at least Eggers explores the concept of slavery and toxic masculinity in intriguing ways. Skarsgård is in peak physical condition, a hulking warrior, but how is it that others see him as less than human? Eggers suggest it comes from a need to “other” someone, a reminder that over a millennium ago, the concept of whiteness was a political one. The Northman is not exactly a funny film, yet the incongruity of Amleth’s slave status leads to some gallows comedy, like when he must participate in a brutal game – something like a cross between rugby and lacrosse – for the amusement of Fjölnir and another lord. Amleth accepts each indignity because it brings him closer to his goal, and the frequent supernatural scenes assure us he does not forget his desire for a glorious afterlife. Or are those otherworldly visits from witches (Björk) and ghosts (Willem Dafoe) only in Amleth’s mind? Eggers keeps that ambiguous, although our personal interpretation has no effect on how he feels about them. Amleth is not exactly a subtle character. There is a part where he participates in a chant by a fire, all meant to amp up his adrenaline before battle, and Skarsgård’s commitment to animalistic rage is almost frightening. It is a physically demanding performance, which is a clever way to set up the most surprising scene, where Amleth finally confronts his mother. At this point, we have mostly seen her from afar. To his surprise and ours, Gudrún’s is not a mere prisoner. She needles Amleth’s simplistic morality – admittedly low-hanging fruit, as he is a Viking – and asserts modern ideas he has no choice but to reject. It is a smart complication of a typical revenge tale, with added subtext because Skarsgård and Kidman once played husband and wife on HBO’s Big Little Lies."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  Played by Sweden’s Alexander Skarsgård, so ripped he looks like he bench pressed Volvos to prepare for the role, Amleth is out to avenge the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Viking epic “The Northman” opens with a bang: a volcano angrily belches fire and lava into the night sky. The year is 895 AD in a craggy corner of the desolate North Atlantic. You might well ask yourself, as I did: How is writer/director Robert Eggers going to top this scene in the rest of this violent fable? Stripping the royal murder-and-vengeance theme of Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” back to its Icelandic and Scandinavian folklore roots, “The Northman” remains positively volcanic even when it’s a human being doing the exploding. Played by Sweden’s Alexander Skarsgård, so ripped he looks like he bench pressed Volvos to prepare for the role, Amleth is out to avenge the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). The warrior monarch fell to the arrows and sword of his duplicitous brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who then seized the throne and also the king’s wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth witnessed this treachery as a boy (played by Oscar Novak), barely escaping with his own life. He has plotted to exact revenge and gain his rightful place on the throne ever since. Fear no spoilers, even if you haven’t seen “Hamlet.” This information is all in the trailers and Amleth mutters the plot basics like a mantra: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” This is surprisingly literal mainstream filmmaking by American auteur Eggers, who co-wrote the story with Icelandic poet Sjón. In his much-lauded previous features “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” Eggers made virtue of narratives that whispered their intent and mostly cloaked their mayhem. Not much is hidden this time, although cinematographer Jarin Blaschke once again views Eggers’ vision through a dark lens. Much of the film is shrouded in smoke, mist and murk, with the gloom infrequently broken by glimpses of the sun or by fires. Craig Lathrop’s production design is also vintage Eggers, which is to say heavily researched and recreated to be as historically accurate as possible. The clothing is of hand-stitched furs, wool and leather. The Viking longboats and longhouse gathering places creak from rough-hewed wood. The weapons seem almost prehistoric. To the pounding drums of the doom-laden score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, Amleth brings the heat in multiple ways — blade, axe, spear, club and even his head — as he and his band of Viking “berserkers,” clad in wolf and bear skins, wreak havoc upon the forces of Fjölnir, a Putin-esque figure who isn’t going to back down easily, if at all. This makes for bleak if mesmeric viewing, even in a rare moment of recreation. A field game that seems to start out as an early version of cricket turns into something resembling a savage mob beating. Kidman doesn’t get much screen time, but her character establishes herself as no mere kidnap victim. She brings to mind a line from “Hamlet”: “God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another.” Anya Taylor-Joy, made famous by Eggers’ “The Witch,” arrives near the 40-minute mark as Olga, no friend of Fjölnir. She sides with Amleth and also fosters the closest thing to romance and family life this film can muster. She helps gives Skarsgård’s character much more humanity than he might otherwise possess; the innate intelligence of both actors also shines through. Then there’s Björk, the Icelandic pop star and actor, barely glimpsed as the mystical Seeress in her first big-screen feature role in 17 years. Majestically accoutred in a headdress fashioned out of feathers and arrowheads that partially covers her eyes, she seems like she’s in a Viking version of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” video as she dispenses both prophecy and warning to Amleth.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," “Now could I drink hot blood,” says Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Act III, scheming to kill his traitorous uncle Claudius as an act of revenge for his own father’s murder. As is usually the case for the waffling Danish prince, the threat is all talk. It won’t be until the end of Act V, amid the play’s climactic swirl of intended and accidental deaths, that Claudius, along with Hamlet himself, his mother, and his already-dead girlfriend’s brother, is finally dispatched. Indeed, if there’s one trait most audiences associate with the character of Hamlet, it’s his self-searching introspection about the meaning of the act of killing and, by extension, of human life. No such doubts are entertained by Amleth, the Viking-era version of the Scandinavian prince played with monomaniacal fury by Alexander Skarsgård in Robert Eggers’ blood-soaked medieval fantasy The Northman. When he is still a preteen (played in early scenes by Oscar Novak), Amleth is guided by his warrior-king father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), through an atavistic coming-of-age ritual best described as a werewolf bar mitzvah. (Spooky! Scary!) Emerging from the hut where the rite was performed, young Amleth watches in horror as his traitorous uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) beheads the king in front of the child’s own eyes, then carries off his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), before sending a henchman to kill the child as well. The traumatized young royal vows, as he escapes alone in a rowboat, to avenge his beloved father’s death at all costs. Two decades later, Amleth has grown up to be the least introspective and least hesitant killer imaginable: He is a berserker, one of a band of roving warriors who psych themselves up for their village-pillaging sprees by donning wolves’ pelts and baying at the moon. Amleth doesn’t just speculate about drinking hot blood. He quaffs it freely, sometimes by literally tearing out his victims’ throats with his teeth. He’s also down to eviscerate, impale, decapitate, or throttle—though unlike some of his fellow marauders, he does draw the line at violence against women, sexual or otherwise. After one especially epic berserking session in the “Land of the Rus” (all the scene changes are identified by runic intertitles), Amleth encounters a Slavic seeress (the Icelandic singer Björk, giving her first performance in a major movie since 2005) who reminds him of his fated encounter back in his native land. Inquiring about the fate of King Fjölnir, Amleth learns that he has been deposed from the throne and is now living as a sheep farmer in Iceland. The single-minded slaughterer then stows away on a slave ship headed for that gorgeously barren landscape—the Iceland scenes were all filmed on location—and passes himself off as a prisoner of war in order to gain passage to Fjölnir’s remote farm, where, unrecognized by his mother and uncle, he finds work as an enslaved laborer. On the ship he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), an enslaved Slavic woman who comes to work alongside him at the farm. Eventually, after some moonlit sexytime in the forest, he confides to her both his royal origin and his secret plan to murder his uncle and rescue his mother from the treacherous Fjölnir—even though Gudrún, played by Kidman with an ice-queen hauteur tinged with camp, appears to be content with the family she’s built with her fratricidal brother-in-law. The Swedish-born Skarsgård, an enthusiast of Viking history since childhood, has been developing this project for over a decade, and in preparation for the role he not only bulked up hugely but trained in everything from horseback riding to sword- and axe-fighting to Japanese Butoh dance. In the visionary director Robert Eggers, an obsessive stickler for historical detail whose two previous films, The Witch and The Lighthouse, both unfurled in similarly grotty half-realist, half-occult period settings, Skarsgård has found the ideal collaborator. Working for the first time with a blockbuster-scaled budget, Eggers can give full range to his feverishly inventive imagination, and the result is often hypnotic, especially in some late sequences where the gravely injured Amleth envisions his entrance into the gates of Valhalla atop the steed of an airborne Valkyrie. A recent New Yorker profile of Eggers revealed the near-comical exactitude of the research he and his team did on the Norse legends and Old Icelandic sagas on which The Northman is based. Their work shows in the result, with stunningly detailed production design by Craig Lathrop and an unsettling score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough that uses historically accurate instruments like the bone flute and the tagelharpa, a lyre with strings made of horsehair. The costumes feel accurate down to the last cloak pin, helmet nose-guard, and mud-spattered head wrap. The screenplay was co-authored by Eggers and the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, a frequent Björk collaborator who also co-wrote the recent folk-horror film Lamb. While the characters’ archaic locutions sometimes evoke laughs that may or may not be intentional, the dialogue also shows an acute ear for the beauty of language and an avoidance of historical anachronism that’s uncommon in the sword-and-sandal tradition this movie hails from. One exception to that rule is some late scenes when a more enlightened Amleth, his vengeance-fixated worldview somewhat softened by his newfound connection to Olga, delivers some lines that sound a tad New Agey for a man who only days ago was skewering his foes like so many gravlax shish kebabs. At 137 minutes, The Northman can feel ponderously crammed with both mystic visions (however hauntingly rendered) and Mel Gibson–grade sadistic gore. Somewhere around the two-hour point, the endless bone-crunching battle scenes—while impeccably choreographed and breathtakingly shot in fluid long takes—start to become existentially wearying and even morally suspect: Sure, our glowering hero’s propensity for violence springs from his own childhood suffering, but what about the countless families he himself is traumatizing with his ever-increasing hunger for butchery? By the time Amleth and Fjölnir finally have their long-fated face-to-face encounter, a sword fight conducted in the (tastefully silhouetted) nude at the lip of an active volcano, I was ready for destiny to do its damn thing already. And honestly, the male nudity in that climactic battle could have done with being a little less tasteful. In a film otherwise fiercely committed to no-punches-pulled realism (and featuring at least three full-body shots of a naked Taylor-Joy, one prominently featuring menstrual blood), was there really any need to digitally elide the battling men’s genitalia so that they appear to be fighting in unseen tighty-whities? If you’re going to put us through two hours and 20 minutes of buildup to the ultimate faceoff between mythic adversaries over a lake of boiling fire, the least you can hand us as payoff is a glimpse at some well-lit swinging Old Norse D. This eleventh-hour concession to what seems to be ratings-board prudishness was one of the rare moments in The Northman when Eggers’ admirably deranged method could have used a little more madness in’t."
"Apr 22, 2022",NEGATIVE," Claims to authenticity can be a ploy for cadging good reviews. When filmmakers trumpet the accuracy of their work, it’s a sign that they’re straining after praise on factual matters and attempting to foreclose critique of a film’s aesthetics, its pleasure factor, or its emotional truth. In short, it’s a kind of advertising. Robert Eggers has been emphasizing, every chance he gets, the extensive research that he put into getting Viking stuff right in “The Northman”—reading, consulting prominent historians, and embodying his findings in the production design and reflecting it in the action. As if anybody but those historians would care much about the details. What critics eat up is the quasi-scholarly activity that squarely places the movie under the aegis of intellectual endeavor, the presumption that factual truth is Eggers’s foremost value and the movie’s preëminent quality. As for non-critics, it’s evidence that Eggers is working very hard for their pleasure. With “The Northman,” it seems to matter to Eggers that we know he suffers for the sake of our gratification and edification. He makes sure to emphasize this point, too, in discussing the physical rigors of the shoot, which took place in Northern Ireland and Iceland, in cold weather and largely outdoors, and involved crowds and battle scenes, some in long and carefully choreographed shots. (One of the elaborate scenes, he said, required some twenty-eight takes.) For all of its elaborate décor and roiling action, “The Northman” is a movie of subtraction, which is developed less by the positive attention to a story than by the elimination of what makes the story enduringly significant. It’s centered on a character named Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), the model for Hamlet. In Eggers’s film, he’s no Danish intellectual but a Viking prince. When the story begins, in 895 A.D., Amleth is a boy (played, at that age, by Oscar Novak) being raised by his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), in the ways of war and the morality of revenge. Aurvandill is murdered by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) before Amleth’s eyes; the boy also sees his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), carried off screaming by his uncle, who usurps the throne. Pursued by Fjölnir’s henchmen, young Amleth escapes by boat. He next appears as an adult, a foundling turned into a Viking warrior—one of the berserkers who, possessed of animal spirit, fight wildly, as if in a trance. As they conquer a fortress in “the land of Rus,” the berserkers enslave the vanquished for their leader, Fjölnir. Guided by his oath—“I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir”—Amleth passes himself off as a slave in order to enter Fjölnir’s new encampment, in Iceland. In the boat that carries the captives, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a native of Rus and a sort of sorceress. They fall instantly in love; he discloses his plan, she swears to help. “Your strength breaks men’s bones,” she says. “I have the cunning to break their minds.” Taken by Fjölnir as a sex slave, Olga manages to fend off his sexual demands; through deeds of valor and brutality, Amleth gains the king’s favor, and takes the opportunity to strike. As a one-man raider, he leaves a trail of corpses that throws Fjölnir’s rustic court into chaos. But his obsession with vengeance threatens his romantic escape with Olga. To tell this story, which Eggers co-wrote with the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, the director creates a pictorial world of visions and wonders, muck and gore, to evoke the crudeness and the cruelty, the mystical tenor and animistic passion, of the Viking realm—of rural northern European medieval society over all. The cinematography conjures wetness and chill in a monochrome palette that’s interspersed with color images which are most notable for the mossy green of hilly fields. The prettiness of the pictures—the careful lighting, the calculated reflections, the gentle drift or dramatic rush of the camera—undercuts the roughness, the cruelty, the gore (decapitations, disembowelments, hacked-off limbs, bloody slashes and beatings), the freeze, the mud, the ice. The images undercut the movie’s sense of physicality altogether. With its prettification of the bodily world, “The Northman” offers no synesthesia, no evocation of any sense beside vision. There’s nothing like a musical sensibility in the images, which may be why the soundtrack is nearly wall-to-wall with a heavy-handed score borrowing Viking instruments to evoke not just the movie’s emotional world but its physical one. One of the disheartening peculiarities of the movie is that it doesn’t convey any of the sensory aspects of the world it depicts. For all the care the production lavishes on making costumes and weapons, on building huts and caves and rendering fire-lit interiors and their furnishings, the camera doesn’t linger on the objects, doesn’t give them texture or weight or temperature. Eggers’s direction is incurious, as if he satisfied and exhausted his enthusiasm in the research. The images are illustrations of the story, decorations of it. If the bulk of research appears to have blocked off the film’s imagination, then the burden of on-set exertion has had a similar effect on the performances of its remarkable cast. The script is an unintentionally ludicrous nonlanguage—an old-fashioned-ese that burdens the actors with unspeakable lines. (Fjölnir, reaching home, expresses delight in seeing his “queen’s fair lox”; then I realized he meant “locks” of hair.) Dialogue is rendered in the pseudo-profound pronouncements that have become the sententious lingua franca of the hero’s quest. The stew of accents and the stilted diction don’t help; the heightened manner applied to grandiose aphorisms offers consistent unintended comedy. Eggers pays more attention to choreographed battles than to the essential simplicity of speech and gesture, which nonetheless occupy far more of the film; his direction doesn’t give the actors a chance to develop a distinctive and consistent stylization that might at least match the artifice of the writing. Even the anthropological and mythological elements drop in with more emphasis on their decorative possibilities and alienating peculiarities than on their substance. It takes an ancient sword of magical power for Amleth to pursue his bloody path, and it’s seen and used, but it’s also inscribed; what does the inscription say? It gets a shaman’s quick explanation, a bit of imagery of its production, even Amleth’s fantasy of using it, but the movie’s mystical and spiritual environment is presented with the same flashy incuriosity as its physical one. (The closest exception is a brief scene that features Björk as a blind visionary; her abstracted manner and cockleshell-dangling headdress hint at the more moving and wondrous film left untapped in the story and the subject.) The implicit relationship of Amleth’s tale to Shakespeare’s play is in the absence of literary style. In regressing to Shakespeare before Shakespeare, Eggers replaces intricate and complex poetry with thudding banalities. He voids Amleth—a muscular warrior raised in crude ways and trained in cruder ones—of any inwardness, as if in fear of rendering him effete or off-putting. Eggers’s action-film Hamlet is neither bookish nor inhibited nor speculative nor plotting with far-reaching imagination of complicated stratagems—nor witty nor, above all, endowed with a sense of humor. Without humor, Shakespeare is utterly inaccessible, incomprehensible. The dun and furrowed narrowness of Amleth’s temperament is a perfect match for the hermetic earnestness and bombast of Eggers’s style, the vanity of the tale of research and effort that takes precedence over the onscreen results themselves. Instead of the roots of Shakespeare’s play, “The Northman” merely serves up its raw material both half-baked and overcooked.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers has built a career for himself crafting intricate films that blend surrealist imagery with a deep interest in history and folklore. The Witch and The Lighthouse are both of a kind; they’re the sort of high-concept horror films that, if you connected with them, you still recommend to others at your own peril. They’re not for everyone. Still, Eggers’ vision on those films is so singular that cult followings formed immediately and persist. These days, it seems the career path for most talented independent filmmakers involves directing one or two well-received features before being scooped up by a big studio to direct a tentpole. In some other universe, maybe Eggers ended up directing an HBOMax spinoff of The Batman; thankfully, his mainstream turn comes in the form of The Northman, a film that aims for wider appeal than his previous efforts but still feels fully of his own creative vision. Although it follows a more straightforward story, it’s mostly got weirdness where it counts. The story is based in part on the Scandanavian legend of Amleth, which served as direct inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet. A prince swears revenge when his father is murdered by his uncle, who then steals his mother. Basic stuff. In Eggers’ telling, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) witnesses the death of his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) at the hands of Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who steals Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth escapes their kingdom as a child and is raised as a berserker by Vikings. He grows strong, bathed in blood and brutality, but fate does not allow him to forget the vow he made the day he ran: Avenge father. Save mother. Kill Fjölnir. That’s what you learn from the trailers, of course, which promise a bizarre medieval Viking revenge film. Eggers delivers that and honestly not much more. Given the fact that the film is very good, it seems silly to warn that The Northman is ultimately pretty conventional — but fans of The Witch and The Lighthouse (or those who despised them) should probably be aware that this is not those films. Comparisons to his previous work aside, The Northman is engrossing, exciting and, most of all, utterly gorgeous. Eggers uses the additional budget to go all-out in his aesthetic choices. His adherence to historic authenticity is allowed to run wild, with cultural sequences that feel ripped from a history book he happened to enjoy. His tendency to frame subjects in the center for the shot, as if filming portraits, is used to tremendous effect, particularly when he introduces the romance between Amleth and sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is, as always, excellent. Although it’s extremely violent (dead children abound), quite a lot of the gore is kept just off-screen — reserved in such a way that feels explicitly designed to avoid an NC-17 rating. It’s a small price to pay for Eggers being allowed to run wild on a studio’s dime, making the sort of blockbuster only he could make. He benefits from adapting one of Western culture’s most iconic plots, which lets him fill in the particulars with his own flights of fancy. Icelandic artist Björk appears as a seeress, and Willem Dafoe gets some excellent material on which to chew. There’s enough Gladiator DNA to sell tickets, and those new to Eggers will only occasionally wonder what the hell they’re watching. Still, there are certainly those moments, and it will be interesting to see if those bits are off-putting to wider audiences. An R-rated thriller is a hard sell these days anyway, at least without the benefit of an IP, even if it tries to hit familiar territory. The Northman won’t likely gain the same level of critical notoriety, and it may still be hard to recommend to audiences who want something shorter, less odd and more to the point. All told, though, it’s a wonder Eggers was even allowed to make something this relatively personal at all. Hopefully he continues to find opportunities like this."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir. Those are the words a young Amleth repeats over and over towards the beginning of The Northman, and those three sentences set the entire stage for Robert Eggers’ Viking epic. Based on an old Scandinavian legend, the film is an intense tale of revenge that also deeply explores Viking culture. It’s brutal yet beautiful with ferocious action sequences paired with stunning visuals. The Northman goes beyond just being another story about Viking savagery and delivers a film that is steeped in lore, rituals, and prophecies. King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) rules his kingdom with an iron fist and live for glorious battle alongside his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and son/heir Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), teaching and molding him so that he may one day take over the throne. Following his return from battle, Aurvandill is betrayed by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and murdered in front of Amleth. He then takes Queen Gudrún as his own, becoming the new king by force while Amleth barely manages to escape with his life. Years later and a now adult Amleth has never forgotten his father and the promises he made. He will avenge him, he will save his mother, and he will kill Fjölnir. On its surface The Northman looks like your standard revenge action drama, but even from the beginning there’s an attention to detail with regards to Viking culture that sets it apart. It is clear that Eggers knows his mythology and has done his research. Amleth wants revenge against his uncle, not only because of what he’s done but also because of what it means as part of his culture. Even if he forgave Fjölnir of his actions, he essentially has to avenge his father because of the oaths he took, otherwise his soul would never rest. From the onset, it’s clear that there is no redemption. Amleth is not a good person. After escaping his kingdom, he is raised to be a warrior by a Viking tribe, and as an adult we see him raid and pillage a neighboring village where women and children are burned alive, trapped in a house set ablaze by the raiders. Violence and rage consumes him, and The Northman doesn’t shy away from showing how that will ultimately lead to more bloodshed. He eventually meets and falls in love with a sorceress named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who assists him in his quest for revenge. But even though there are times where she believes they can escape and live in freedom together, Amleth is steadfast in his purpose. Eggers does a good job at alluding to this cycle of violence and how those who are molded by the blade eventually end up inflicting the same pain and suffering on others. I couldn’t help but think of the young children seeing their parents and elders getting brutally murdered in the same fashion as Amleth saw his. It’s a vicious circle where there are no winners. And yet The Northman does an excellent job at getting you to understand Amleth’s drive and rage. He’s the last living legacy of his father. He believes it’s his purpose to kill his uncle, handed down to him by the gods. At one point Odin himself sends down a pack of ravens to rescue Amleth, showing that he has indeed been chosen. Through the prophecies, it makes it seems like his mission is all but inevitable. Even if he wanted to go down a different path, he would eventually come back to his revenge. That is his fate. The Northman is a stunningly brutal and beautiful Viking epic that explores their culture with such attention to detail. It’s bloody, yes, but every frame has a sense of purpose. Robert Eggers is now three for three following the terrifying The Witch and the traumatizing The Lighthouse. I already cannot wait to see what he does next. If you’re even the tiniest bit interested in Viking mythology, The Northman is an absolute must-watch. Based on an old Scandinavian legend, the film is an intense tale of revenge that also deeply explores Viking culture. It’s brutal yet beautiful with ferocious action sequences paired with stunning visuals. The Northman goes beyond just being another story about Viking savagery and delivers a film that is steeped in lore, rituals, and prophecies."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," The brutal Viking epic “The Northman” is one of the most violent films of the year. It’s also likely to be one of the best. Director Robert Eggers made waves in 2015 with “The Witch,” a bleak and frightening American gothic horror movie that also introduced audiences to actress Anya Taylor-Joy (see “The Queen’s Gambit”). He followed up with the dense and difficult fantasy drama “The Lighthouse” in 2019. Anyone brave enough to sit through an Eggers double feature knows that appreciating his work requires an acquired taste. So, when it was announced that he would be making a Viking saga, I can’t say I was excited about the prospect of enduring two-plus punishing hours of Eggers’ discomfort. While I admired his previous two films, they were nearly impossible to recommend except to a select few. Eggers is a director of remarkable skill, and because producers recognize him as an emerging auteur, he’s given the resources to realize his vision. With a rumored budget of around $90 million, Eggers gets the funds required to explore Viking culture vividly. And he doesn’t disappoint. While retaining hints of his previous uncompromising approach to visual storytelling, this movie is much more accessible and will appeal to a broader audience. It’s a blunt film made for adults that shows us the maturation of an important cinematic voice. In “The Northman,” Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, a Viking prince robbed of his kingdom as a child when his uncle Fjölnir (“The Square’s” Claes Bang) kills his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Pledging vengeance, Amleth flees his island home and spends the next twenty years abroad evolving into a chiseled Viking berserker. Skarsgård, who first came to wide attention playing another Northman in HBO’s “True Blood,” makes an impressive warrior, abandoning his sleek, lean physique in favor of a beefier but still a fiercely muscular killing machine. And it wasn’t Eggers who originated the project. Instead, the Swedish Skarsgård was the first to conceive of the film, and he was the one who helped get Eggers on board. After a blood-soaked battle where his clan of half-wolf or half bear men take control of a severely outmatched village, Amleth has a prophetic vision. Visited by the blind Seeress (played by none other than Iceland’s Björk, of course), he is reminded that there’s unfinished business elsewhere. He must avenge his father’s death and take back his birthright. In the process, he has to save his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and kill his evil uncle. To have his revenge, Amleth assumes the identity of an enslaved person and travels roughly by sea in hopes of infiltrating his uncle’s fiefdom. On the ship, he encounters an alluring woman named Olga (Taylor-Joy), who has an odd connection to the supernatural. But once Amleth arrives on his uncle’s soil, he discovers that things are not how he remembers them. Revenge is a complicated thing. Together with his co-writer Sjón (see last year’s provocative “Lamb” and the Oscar-nominated “Dancer in the Dark”), Eggers adopts classic Shakespearean structure in crafting this penetrating Norse tale. We get shades of “Hamlet” combined with elements of “Beowulf” and even a hint of “The Lion King” as Amleth seeks his revenge at all costs. I positively wriggled with glee when the title of one of the final acts dropped, coupled with a perfectly timed explosive burst from a fiery volcano. Yes, this Eggers movie is for me, and I suspect I’m not the only one who will grasp his achievement. The visceral narrative is unrelenting as the tragedy unfolds. This film isn’t some manicured sword and sandal affair. The people depicted on-screen appear to exist in a time and place with tangible weight. The American-born Eggers, who started his career in production design, engaged the assistance of British archaeology professor and author Neil Price, who specializes in the magic, sorcery, and religion of the Viking Age. While fantasy elements are present, they never distract from the palpable horror on display. The result is far from the romanticized Nordic-inspired films of Hollywood’s past (see 1958’s “The Vikings”). By the time Eggers lets loose with Amleth’s berserker rage, viewers should appreciate the artistry and the passion that went into “The Northman.” I can’t say enough good things about this movie. Still, I recognize that some viewers may be turned off by the level of amoral bloodletting associated with the unkind period in history. But the inhumanity for me set the perfect tone, a vicious assault with purpose and power and, ultimately, a heart. The moral should be lost on no one. The beauty of Iceland becomes a character in this movie. The stunning images are captured by Oscar-nominated cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, with whom Eggers worked on “The Lighthouse” and “The Witch.” Watching this epic on a big screen is essential to take in the grandeur of the production fully."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"For all its relentless fury and fire, ""The Northman"" has a remote iciness that hampers emotional investment in the Shakespearean heroes and villains. That said, its vast medieval-era storytelling is stunning in its vivid and realistic presentation."
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,If you want to see a cinematic spectacle of Viking violence and warrior masculinity - this is going to be for you!
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," 
    Liberally frosted for premium impact, director Robert Eggers’s North Atlantic of AD 829 is almost viscerally wintry but the blood of its people is boiling.
    “If I fall by the enemy’s sword, you must avenge me or forever live in shame,” King Aurvandill (Hawke) instructs his unfortunate young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), with prophetic relish. The next
    day the king is dead, sliced to oblivion by his brother Fjölnir (Bang).
 
    Swearing vengeance, the horrified yet enterprising Amleth escapes in a rowboat, leaving his regal mother, Queen Gudrún (Kidman and her overflowing wig), in Fjölnir’s grasping hands. Rescued by
    Viking berserkers (and if ever a name spoke for itself…), Amleth, now furiously played by Skarsgård, grows into a throwback, wolf-channelling version of an angry young man, complete with
    chiselled six-pack and heavy heart.
 
    Heavy and how: bear in mind that Amleth is not only Scandinavian legend’s precursor to Hamlet but Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse), who co-wrote the screenplay
    with Icelandic poet Sjón, is the furthest thing from a featherweight. Given their full, atavistic due by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, the punishing landscapes are a monumental canvas for
    misery that refuses to say die — although God knows, there is more than enough death to go around. Amleth will have his majestically framed revenge, further tainted by the knowledge of his
    mother’s perfidy and the surrendering of his lover Olga (Taylor-Joy). But his settling of old scores will also have him.

"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eggers serves up a Viking Hamlet. It wasn't as unhinged as we were hoping for, the plot is echoic, and many characters (particularly the female ones) lacked dimension. There's however justtt enough going for the film for it to have been watchable for us. "
"Apr 22, 2022",NEUTRAL," The devil is in the detail, they say. Robert Eggers, the dark magician who conjured twisted tales The VVitch and The Lighthouse, is undoubtedly a man consumed by the magisterial minutiae. Revelling in welding historical fact onto the whispering menace of age-old folkloric horror stories, his macabre movies feel lived in their sickly skins. Abundantly ambitious, Eggers is armed with a considerable budget for the first time for his third feature, Viking epic The Northman. By Odin’s beard, it is a monumental achievement. Opening with the portentous eruption of a mighty volcano, we’re left with little doubt as to the scale of the tale about to unfold. Eggers teamed up with Icelandic author and Lamb scribe Sjón to unleash this thunderous Scandinavian legend about Prince Amleth, the man who would one day become Shakespeare’s Hamlet.  Whisked across storm-lashed seas to a cliff-huddled encampment by twin ravens, no doubt Odin’s obsidian-feathered familiars Hugin and Munin, we first meet him as an amiably rambunctiousness boy played by Oscar Novak. He notably took on the mantle of the young Bruce Wayne in The Batman. Overjoyed at the return of his warfaring father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (an impressively bearded Ethan Hawke), their reunion is derailed by a spot of toxic male bonding. Foregoing a conjugal reunion with Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Aurvandil instead drags his son into a hellish pit where they promptly prostrate themselves like howling wolves, lapping from psychedelic trip-inducing dog bowls at the feet of a gnarly He-Witch (Ingvar Sigurdsson). Fun! It’s a marvellously menacing rite of passage, captured with stomach-churningly discomforting camerawork by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke. The boy becomes a man as his father predicts his bloody undoing and commands vengeance before the fact. Fate does not wait long.  The Square star Claes Bang, as the raven-haired Fjölnir the soon-to-be Brotherless, stages a coup, slaughtering the king and seizing his wife and throne. Amleth escapes by rowboat, and Big Little Lies star Alexander Skarsgård becomes our avenging warrior, sulkily marauding in distant lands. He appears to have struck a deal bargain with Skaði, the Norse god of the mountains, because his shoulders seem hewn from boulders. His Amleth is a rumbling hearted man of few words and a furrowed brow, not unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger’s inexorable terminator, as swaddled in Conan the Barbarian’s wolf hide. He’s also a lost soul who at first appears to have given up on exacting justice while happily destroying many more families in a swathe of merciless pillaging. Which is how he comes to (literally) pick up The VVitch star Anya Taylor-Joy, as stoic Slavic villager Olga, in a thrilling near one-shot scene dripping with gory mayhem.  Directions arrive via a gloriously gothic seeress, announced with the skittering flutter of unseen bird wings, played by Björk, who collaborated with Sjón on her Oscar-nominated music for Dancer in the Dark). Things didn’t work out so well for his unctuous uncle, who has already been unseated and now lords it over a blasted sheep farm. Not that natural justice will be allowed to have its way, of course. This is a Viking melodrama, after all, so Amleth feigns slavery alongside Olga and hops on a refugee boat bearing them inexorably back towards his date with destiny and Fjölnir in fields of fire. Once home, not everything is as it seems, with Eggers working a gloriously jaw-dropping reveal that leads to an excellent guerrilla warfare sequence as Amleth and Olga terrorise and pick off, one-by-one, Fjölnir’s men with the subtle knife of imagined sorcery.  Sure, The Northman features a zombie chieftain, visions of the tree of kings and the ride of a solitary Valkyrie, but these fantastical elements are measured in sparing drops. Eggers instead revels in the hard-won reality of a gruelling, seven-month shoot in the wild winds, icy dark and trudging mud. Linda Muir’s costumes and Craig Lathrop’s impeccable production design are bolstered by historical precision, guided by literary scholar Johanna Katrin Fridriksdottir and archaeologist Neil Price. It’s a film that sears itself into the senses via nightmares glimpsed in the hellish half-light. Skarsgård’s physical transformation is astounding to behold, but it’s Kidman who steals the show. Without giving too much away – you’ll know the moment when you see it – Queen Gudrún appears to metamorphose before our very eyes using nothing but ancient shadow play by firelight and a facial acting tour de force.  The mark of a seasoned actor throwing out the rulebook, her turn recalls the temptation of elven queen Galadriel. To borrow Tolkien’s turn of phrase: ‘I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night!’ Words that perfectly sum up The Northman.  Kidman’s howl into the darkness is the pinnacle of a majestic film that towers on the back of Egger’s obsessive world-building. Armed with Blaschke’s deft hand and reinforced by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s imperious score, it’s a diabolical dance towards the gates of Valhalla. The All Father of them all, before there was Spartacus, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea director Richard Fleischer paired Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis as blood brothers at each other’s necks in this classic Hollywood spectacular that puts the horn-blowing din in Odin. Look not here for historical authenticity, no seer (beyond some real nifty boat-crafting), but it does serve up some seriously tasty slices of ham and the magnificent side dish of Janet Leigh as a captured Welsh princess.  Kenneth Branagh certainly had fun upending Norse mythology by bringing Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby’s trippy comic book take on the god of thunder to crackling life on the big screen for the now-unstoppable Marvel movie machine. But Chris Hemsworth’s debut in the role was a little too stuffily Shakespearean. The mercurial jester that is Taika Waititi banishes the boring bits to blast out this wild space rock opera complete with Tessa Thompson’s mead-swilling Valkyrie. Our Cate Blanchett is Hela good, nearly besting Tom Hiddleston’s trickster god Loki as the queen of death herself. "
"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE," The story of Amleth has seen many permutations throughout the ages. Skirting back to an Old Norse poem of the 10th century, the Amleth’s tale is as mercurial as time itself. Stretching back to the beginning, there are some almost concrete connections, even between the various iterations of the poem. There’s a king and his wife and their son Amleth. The king is slaughtered by his brother, who then marries the wife and Amleth eventually slays his uncle. A story as old as time, Amleth’s most popularized mythology stems from when William Shakespeare drew upon the Scandinavian legend to write his play Hamlet. In the Northman, co-writer and director Robert Eggers once again turns his love of history into a fierce tale of madness, revenge and fate. And while it’s a story that doesn’t stretch the revenge story in new directions, its bold execution, supernatural embellishments and staggering attention to detail more than makes up for the slight story. The Northman begins on an oppressively quiet note in 895 with the return of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) to his wife Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his son Amleth (Oscar Novak). During his conquests, Aurvandil was severely injured and believes he will soon die, so he decides to pass on the role of king to his very young son. “He’s only a cub,” Gudrún protests. But so was Aurvandil’s father when he took the throne.  Because the next day, after a ceremony involving farting and belching and pure animalistic behavior, Aurvandil is slain in front of Amleth by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Fjölnir sets his men to find and kill Amleth, who runs through his village as Fjölnir’s men pillage and destroy the village before he manages to sneak to a lone boat by the ocean. It’s here, tears in his eyes and vengeance on his tongue as Amleth rows out to sea, that Robert Eggers and his co-writer Sjón distill the story to its barest and simplest form: I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir. When we catch up to Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) years later, he’s a viking soldier marching through encampments with his shoulders arched forward like the bear of a man he is. Men are slain, children are burned in locked huts and women are taken for slaves. But Amleth’s journey is recharted by the appearance of a witch (Björk) who reminds him that he is unable to escape the wheels of fate, sending him on a collision course with his father’s killer. Along the way, he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the two of them begin plotting Fjölnir’s demise. In The Northman, Eggers and Sjón take the story that would one day influence Shakespeare and make it about a miserable creature, tortured by the machinations of Fate. A Fate so cruel and callous that he not only can’t escape its pull, but seems unwilling to try. Lusciously filmed by Jarin Blaschke, who also shot The Witch and The Lighthouse, The Northman is desaturated to the point of being almost black and white, with pops of color highlighting specific scenes. It’s a grim story that dabbles in the supernatural and uses its mysticism as a way of exploring themes of fate, revenge, eternal rewards and what it means to be a man in viking society. It’s the perfect third film for a director whose career has explored toxic masculinity and its effect on social interactions. It’s also the perfect calling card to suggest he’s up to filming pure action films, as the moments of violence punctuate nicely stylized and thrilling set pieces.  But as dour as the film could be, Eggers also reaches back into the fantasy genre, particularly the sword and sorcery epics of the late 70s and early 80s, to add levity and horror trappings. While The Northman probably won’t be considered a horror film, Eggers continues to imbue his features with more than simple embellishments of the genre. One particular moment set in a tomb calls back to the more horror-minded fantasies of the 80s, like The Sword and the Sorcerer or Conan. But beneath the images of flying valkyries or warriors long dead and decayed, The Northman is at its best as the final part of Eggers’ triptych of films exploring the concepts of masculinity. By opening the film with Queen Gudrún’s fateful reminder that Aurvandil’s father had to kill his uncle to ascend his throne, The Northman suggests a circuitous path of fate, one that has ensnared Amleth and everyone in his orbit.  You know how the film will end, even if you don’t know the specifics. And while narratively it’s a shame that Eggers and Sjón’s themes don’t subvert the standard revenge tale, it's ferocious enough to satisfy. The Northman misses the thematic depth of Eggers’ first two films, but the talent on display is unmistakable and cements Eggers as a force of nature as mercurial and frightening as Amleth’s rage.

"Apr 22, 2022",POSITIVE,"A tumultuous, graphically gorgeous entertainment for our time as well as an ineffably somber meditation on our species’ seemingly inexhaustible reservoir of savagery."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Watching The Northman, I kept on thinking, “I am so happy that I let things go.” Based off the 10th century Nordic poem that would inspire Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the visually stunning, mythic story-telling is a brilliant look at how exhausting revenge can be. Starring Alexander Skarsgard as Amleth, it is hard not to see True Blood fans getting soft at witnessing our Viking King bloody with abs out. Vivid! Gory! Epically Existential! I watched the Northman with big eyes as my mind analyzed why this tale will always be relevant. History is repetitive. Wars! Slavery! Genocide! Uprisings! Peace Movements! Icons! Love Stories! Heroes! Redemption Arcs! All of these things happen every day, and embody the story of Amleth from his beginning. We meet him as a boy, excited to see his King Father and cherished by his Queen Mother (Nicole Kidman KILLING It As The Vicious Queen Godrun) . Yet, if there is one thing about our childhood that rings true, especially when we become adults, is how illusional we were. Part of why adulthood is harsh is that illusions evaporate. For Amleth, his father was a great man, his mother a loyal wife, and his world blessed by Odinson. Yet, that was life according to child’s eyes, and a wolf is born when someone plucks them, i.e. Claes Bang as Fjolnir. Skarsgard is so carnal in this role. Every scene exemplifies what happens when an entire life is framed according to one traumatic event and the determination/ delusion that revenge is justice and justice rights a wrong or, at least, gives a gain to a loss. With scenes of witchery (Bjork as Seeress), and a gorgeous instance of godly, Valkyrie presence that hails to a time when people’s stories felt legendary, The Northman exemplifies why we loves myths; they make being human feel extraordinary. Writer/ Director Robert Eggers takes on this old tale with panache and preciseness; making it every scenes like a turning of a page in an acclaimed book.We are fascinated by a man who loses it all, does everything to regain it, and, in turn, relearns what gain and loss mean to then go off to his eternal rest,. Hence, my prior statement, with a 2022 lens, Eggers’ writing makes you realize that, perhaps, an entire life grieving what you lost can truly stop you from what you can gain. Starring Anya Taylor Joy as the bewitching Olga/ love interest of Amleth, the movie becomes a sincere questioning over whether revenge is truly freeing or worth it? She mesmerizes as a slave with enough cunning to free everyone from their literal chains, but not the internal ones that bind them to the past: I.e. Amleth. While Ethan Hawke stars as King Aurvandil, I am so in love with him as Arthur Harrow on Moon Knight, I can’t see him as anyone else. Besides, this is Skargard’s show, and even Willem Dafoe’s Heimir’s talking dead head cannot change that. The Northman is out in theaters April 22."
"Apr 21, 2022",NEUTRAL," A gory tale of murder, conquest, and revenge, The Northman (★★★☆☆) unfolds like the sort of epic that Viking warriors might have passed down for generations, sharing over horns of ale around a roaring fire: the haunting Legend of Prince Amleth. The exiled prince’s trials and adventures appear to have been shot by firelight, too. Writer-director Robert Eggers and his Oscar-nominated Lighthouse cinematographer Jarin Blaschke opt for enveloping the action in shadows and mist, the natural darkness of a northern land where winter nights are long, and the days short. Even the film’s climactic showdown, a naked sword fight by a lake of lava and fire, is depicted as a brutal clash between silhouettes backlit by flames. Rivals dueling on an erupting volcano forms a gorgeous tableau, but audiences might, for various reasons, wish they could actually see more of the combatants swinging their swords — especially the ferocious Amleth, embodied heartily by Alexander Skarsgård. The erstwhile Tarzan delivers a gruelingly physical performance, fighting, running, lifting, swimming, hauling, speaking primarily and most clearly through Amleth’s vivid body language. The camera captures as much rage and intention in how Amleth leaps at his opponents as it does in any shot of Skarsgård’s face, or speaking any line of dialogue. The actor turns the taciturn warrior into a stealthy weapon of vengeance, with perhaps just one weakness: Amleth is forever haunted by having witnessed the murder of his father, and the kidnapping of his mother. He won’t know peace until he has avenged them. Eggers and co-screenwriter Sjón (who also co-wrote last year’s eccentric drama Lamb) basically have grafted a Viking revenge narrative onto the bones of Hamlet, and, as usual for Shakespeare, the plotting holds up well to adaptation. The cast are up to the task of delineating the complex emotions of family infighting that, between bouts of blood-and-guts violence, propel Amleth’s tale. Ethan Hawke — not exactly the first Hollywood actor brought to mind by the phrase “Viking ruler” — lends a stirring nobility to his doomed King Aurvandil, father of Amleth. And Danish actor Claes Bang, so compelling in the title role of Netflix’s recent Dracula mini-series, makes an equally potent antagonist here, as Aurvandil’s half-brother Fjölnir. Resentful Fjölnir covets his brother’s kingdom and his wife, Queen Gudrún, portrayed with icy resolve by Nicole Kidman. The Oscar-winner spends much of the film on the sidelines, as Gudrún’s mind and motivations remain a mystery. While the character serves mostly as adviser to the men in her life, Kidman saves her real firepower for when Gudrún finally lays all her cards on the table in a gripping monologue clarifying the queen’s loves and allegiances. It’s a marvelous scene, and one of the few times that words speak louder than actions amidst the deep shadows, stormy grays, and earthy palette of Eggers’ dense, mystical Dark Ages. Amleth sees light only in his glorious visions of valkyries, and in the love of kind, enslaved Olga, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, who also starred in Eggers’ 2015 breakout hit The Witch. In fact, ancient witchcraft and hallucinogen-driven visions play a crucial role in Amleth’s quest for revenge, as he’s told his fate by fortune-teller, the Seeress (a most welcome Björk). But no amount of magic can conjure much romantic chemistry between Taylor-Joy and Skarsgård, who, rather, commits his body and soul to the one thing Amleth really lives for, revenge. Again and again, Amleth is offered a choice between hope and death, forgiveness and retribution. He never wavers. The movie strikes its hardest blow in showing a man who will proudly raise his sword for vengeance every time. These are challenging times for news organizations.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," THE NORTHMAN, written and directed by Robert Eggers, is totally worth the hype. Brutal, raw, intense, and surprising, this is the exact kind of movie that you should make an event out of and see in theaters. Despite the film’s dark subject matter, if you looked at me during the screening I probably had a huge grin on my face the entire time because this is the exact kind of ambitious, exciting, beautifully shot storytelling that makes me a proud movie lover. I was constantly in awe of the long takes, gorgeous cinematography, and phenomenal performances from the ensemble cast.  Based off of a Scandinavian legend (and the inspiration for Shakespeare’s HAMLET), THE NORTHMAN tells the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), a prince without a kingdom. As a boy, his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) killed Amleth’s father (Ethan Hawke) and took the kingdom and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) for his own; Amleth barely escaped with his life. Now living in exile, Amleth is fueled by his quest to “Avenge father, save mother, kill Fjölnir.” Armed with the location of his uncle’s new homestead and the companionship of the clever Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth quickly realizes this task is easier chanted than done.  This story may seem familiar, but this is certainly not the HAMLET or LION KING that you may be expecting. There are many exciting surprises that are sure to shock you and make you think twice about this mystical, legendary tale.  THE NORTHMAN is one of the most cinematic, beautifully shot films I have seen in a long time thanks to cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and the beautiful landscapes of Iceland and Ireland. Eggers is known for his attention to historic detail, so it was no surprise that he relied on natural light to frame each scene. And not only that, he added an even greater level of difficulty by shooting so many of the scenes in long, continuous takes. And these aren’t your average WEST WING walk and talk scenes, these were actual combat scenes with hundreds of actors and elements. If just one element failed, the whole scene would have to be canned. At times it was difficult for me to even pay attention to the story because I was so overwhelmed by what Eggers was doing behind the camera. This is movie making at its finest.  Not only is the film beautifully shot, but the performances showcase actors at the top of their games. It is clear that THE NORTHMAN is Skarsgard’s passion project and I have never seen him more perfectly embody a character. Everything from his slouched posture to the growl of his voice shows Amleth has endured unimaginable trauma, which has worn on him throughout the years; his rage and fury threatening to spill over at any second, in any interaction or battle.  Skarsgard’s chemistry with Taylor-Joy is another highlight of the film and is going to be one of my favorite on-screen ships for years to come. Taylor-Joy brings the brains to Skarsgard’s brawn and the two make an incredible duo. “Your strength breaks men’s bones. I have the cunning to break their minds,” says Olga. Like I really need another reason to fangirl over Taylor-Joy. How she can go from projects like THE QUEEN’S GAMBIT to LAST NIGHT IN SOHO to now THE NORTHMAN proves she is one of the most talented and versatile actors working today. And of course, I cannot end this review without talking about the queen (literally and figuratively) Nicole Kidman. I should never be surprised when Kidman knocks it out of the park because she has been doing so for over three decades now. But when I, a Nicole Kidman subject matter expert, tell you her performance in THE NORTHMAN is one of her best and most surprising roles yet, believe me. I was floored by her multi-layered character arc that, without getting into spoilers, kept me guessing the entire time. Her character is the catalyst of the entire film and I am excited for people to see her in such a different role. When leaving the theater after the film, a group was gathered around THE NORTHMAN poster shocked that it was Nicole Kidman in the role and that they hadn’t realized it. Now, do I think it is insane that they didn’t recognize her onscreen? Yes, but that just shows how different this role is from how regular audiences perceive her and I am here for it. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," For a guy like Robert Eggers, the concept of mainstream filmmaking doesn’t seem like it holds all that much water. The New England-based writer/director stuck pretty closely to his roots for his first two features, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” both of which are set in the region, albeit at times that modern New Englanders would barely recognize. Both films were also quite insular, with small casts and minimal locations, which is the sort of filmmaking that you can do on a relatively small budget. He also leaned heavily on historical accounts to try and make the dialogue and accents as authentic to the period as possible — an approach that can make simply figuring out what everyone is saying an exercise in its own right. And yet, despite their potential limited scope, “The Witch” made ten times its budget at the box office, and “The Lighthouse” had enough acclaim to receive an Oscar nomination. It’s the sort of path that leads to Colin Trevorrow making “Jurassic World” or Chloe Zhao making “The Eternals.” If he wanted to, Eggers could follow in those same footsteps. Instead, with the $90 million budget provided by Focus Features, Eggers has chosen to stick to his roots with “The Northman,” a film most easily described as “Hamlet” if told by Vikings. So, it’s certainly no coincidence that our main character, Amleth (first played as a child by Oscar Novak), has such a similar name. He is the son of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrün (Nicole Kidman), and is preparing to take the crown one day. That day comes earlier than expected when his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) stages a bloody coup and kills Aurvandil in front of him. Amleth manages to escape, stealing a boat and rowing north with one mantra repeating in his head: “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” It’s quite the cold open, featuring an elongated coming-of-age ritual led with pomp and circumstance by Willem Dafoe in a way that only he can. This first salvo sets the stage for what the audience will be seeing over the remaining two hours or so: a dark and moody tale of anger and revenge, and one not afraid to shy away from violence. As the story shifts years into the future, Amleth has grown into a fearsome berserker (now played by Alexander Skarsgård), though he has never forgotten his mantra. He discovers that Fjölnir has lost his kingdom and fled to Iceland, and decides that smuggling himself into his nemesis’ employ as a slave is the best opportunity to get his revenge. It’s here that he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who appears to have some sort of supernatural powers tied to the earth and is poised to become an unlikely ally in his quest for revenge. But before Amleth can get to Fjölnir’s throat, he has to establish himself in his good graces, which takes time and patience. There is an inherent risk to a project like this. More money means more oversight, and the sort of films that Eggers makes are not exactly designed to hold up to the scrutiny of the kind of audience a $90 million film would need for profitability. And indeed, “The Northman” begins with an ominous shot of an active volcano belching black smoke while a thunderous droning narration speaks of valor and honor and prophecy and death. That mood continues for the rest of the film — one sodden with blood, viscera and hallucinogenic visions of Valkyries and a physical family tree with each king in Aurvandil’s line attached by an umbilical cord-like branch. It’s a lot to take in, so it’s not a surprise that early test screenings came back with mixed responses. Luckily, the release doesn’t feel hobbled by the studio meddling with the final cut; it remains a film of fierce vision and the same uncompromised storytelling that has become Eggers’ calling card. As with his previous films, Eggers has assembled a pitch-perfect cast with the aid of casting director Kharmel Cochrane. Skarsgård, who appears to have shed every ounce of fat that came anywhere near his body, certainly embodies the role of a man who has turned himself into a machine built for the express purpose of revenge. He’s a lither Conan the Barbarian, and while much of the middle of the film hides his musculature in bulky slave clothes, he more than fits the bill for Eggers’ fight scenes that are heavily inspired by the work of Frank Frazetta. Taylor-Joy, who had her breakout role in “The Witch,” takes advantage of her striking looks to stand out from a crowd of people wearing the same clothes and has an almost otherworldly quality that plays into her mysterious past and powers. Bang could easily have played Fjölnir as an overwrought villain, wallowing in his ill-gotten gains, but the man we meet on a remote farm in Iceland hardly seems worth the strife it takes to get to him. That ends up working brilliantly into the film’s central theme, exploring whether a decades-old vendetta even qualifies as revenge when the people involved barely resemble who they once were. Revenge, no matter how justified it may be, is often a pyrrhic victory at best. By the time “The Northman” comes to its end with a breathtaking final battle, two things were absolutely clear in my mind: Robert Eggers is perhaps the most impressive new filmmaker to crop up in the last decade, and no studio is ever going to give him $90 million again. Its long, quiet second act and Eggers’ eccentricities are likely to turn off the sort of audience needed to make a film like this profitable. Luckily, a film’s presumed box office failings speak nothing to its quality, which “The Northman” has in spades (or axes, as it were). Eggers has made a bloody and brutal epic awash with mysticism and intrigue. We rarely get movies like this anymore, with an emerging auteur given the time and money to craft the big-budget film that he wants to make. The fact that “The Northman” is as good as it is almost feels like a bonus. You can find our full content archive

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Is it too soon to talk about go-to themes and styles where director Robert Eggers is concerned? He has, after all, only made three features to date; who knows, he could head somewhere very different next time he works. A comedy musical perhaps. But, let’s indulge ourselves here and look at what he does seem to enjoy. Remote, hostile landscapes; historical settings; isolated groups of people; the interplay of destiny and choice, and hints of supernaturalism, which still retain an air of uncertainty. These elements run through The Witch (2015), The Lighthouse (2019) and – despite ostensibly opting for a Viking epic, these shape The Northman (2022), too. This isn’t really a Viking epic as a lot of audiences might expect, although it has more than its share of blood and iron: it’s a far more brooding film, intimate in fact, where the worlds of men and magic overlap, leading one another. In this sense, it’s probably a closer facsimile of how the warriors and settlers of the Viking Age saw their world than other stories we may have seen on film, as well as – in some ways – an obvious choice for Eggers. The plot itself is simple enough – and reads as rather accessible, perhaps more so than The Witch (and certainly more so than The Lighthouse, which tested this reviewer to the limits). The plot is based loosely on part of the Gesta Danorum, which itself inspired Hamlet. Young prince Amleth is heir to a small kingdom, where he lives with his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). The return of his father gives him cause for celebration, though his father is alarmed by how childish Amleth remains; he therefore makes it his business to educate him, taking him through rituals which will assure his son of his place in the great tree of kings. This is all the more pressing, as the King has returned from raiding with a vicious wound which he fears will kill him, depriving him of an honourable death. ‘Plan for the worst, hope for the best’ is the motto of the day – and it’s all in good time, as King Aurvandil (Ethan bloody Hawke!) is almost instantly overthrown by his scheming brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who orders the princeling executed.  The boy escapes however, Arya Stark-like in his repeated avowals of revenge, rowing desperately out to sea where it seems he’s picked up by other Vikings, on their way to settle the land of the Rus. He is raised by them, trained by them and, as a grown man and a fierce Berserker, he begins to give further thought to his destiny. An opportunity presents itself after his clan plunders a village, kidnapping a number of Slavs; Amleth (the picturesque Alexander Skarsgård) decides to smuggle himself to his uncle’s current abode in a settlement on Iceland, disguised as a Slavic slave. On the journey, he develops a closeness with another slave, a Slav girl known as Olga of the Birch Trees (Anya Taylor-Joy), one of several of the witches and magicians who shape his actions. When they arrive in Iceland, Amleth is unrecognisable to his mother or uncle, though further trance-like, magical experiences convince him he is on the right path. Is it that clear, though? The film goes on to disrupt some of these expectations, and it lingers on Amleth’s predicament as he slowly attempts to unpick the small Icelandic community where it seems his only family has moved on, perfectly contentedly, without him. This is where the film differs quite significantly from many other Viking stories told on film; it pauses to consider this man’s trauma, in ways which are normally ignored to get straight to the battle scenes. Consider films such as Pathfinder (2007): the Vikings here, whilst terrific fun to watch, are all but two-dimensional, and barely act like thinking and feeling men at all. Other films of a similar persuasion treat their Viking characters as a means to an end, mainly able to fight and bleed until they finally keel over. Eggers has made something much more thoughtful, though without lacking for scenes of incredibly gruesome gore. If The Northman is similar to anything else, then it’s Valhalla Rising (2009), which also manages to balance violence against its introspection, albeit with a similar predilection for spilled intestines and for landscapes which would ably kill you through exposure, never mind anything else. But the trauma is not Amleth’s alone: other characters have their share, and deal with it in ways their own, even where this subverts character arcs which may have seemed pretty clear-cut.  This is the film’s greatest strength, this choice to explore how trauma operates, whilst retaining the mad fantasy elements playing out elsewhere. Although she was talking about a time around four hundred years ahead of the world of the film, historian Barbara Tuchmann has commented that so many European movers and shakers, kings and princes, acted in the erratic, cruel, incomprehensible ways they did because they were unnurtured, unloved, often traumatised and abused adolescents with something to prove. It rings true here: Amleth is motivated by the unhappy life he has led up until this point, and seeks salvation in the only way he has been taught to expect it. In this respect, although he is our hero, he’s ambiguous, particularly when he discovers certain truths. It keeps the film engaging, for even where there are lulls in the action (at well over two hours, of course there are lulls) there are motivations to consider. Throw in a whack of altered states, dreams and witchcraft, which the film often does, and the time moves on pretty steadily overall. Relationships between men and women are also explored through magic, as well as through largely-understated appraisals of their power play. Performances are solid, too, keeping moments of happiness rather rare. The film also does an excellent job of portraying the mud, cold and grim practicalities for Northern European settlers in this early Medieval period, in a film which is borderline monochrome on so many occasions: it’s a gloomy, sparse world. The Northman is a serious prospect with serious players, a tale of revenge slowed down and explored through elements of horror as well as historical fantasy. It’s certainly a spectacle, for all its slower moments, but a largely effective and successful spectacle: by the time the credits roll, it’s hard not to be utterly swept away by it."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," It’s called “The Northman,” but it’s really about a boy. A young Viking prince, in fact, whose proud, battle-scarred father is determined to prepare him to one day assume his wintry throne. And thus begins director Robert Eggers’ magnificent once-upon-a-time, which unfolds to become a mesmerizing, sometimes-dreamlike cinematic masterpiece — and quite possibly the first truly great movie of 2022. Throughout the pandemic and the communal navel-gazing it has brought, we’ve gotten a lot of movies that have Something Important to say. Lessons to teach us. Ideas to share. Here, we get something that feels a touch old-fashioned by contrast: a film that wants nothing more than to build a credible world, then spin a hell of a story inside it. And “The Northman” does exactly that, rocketing forward with its tale of broadswords and longboats, and propelled to its inevitably violent end by an encounter with an Icelandic seer-witch, a fateful prophecy and a mystical, vaguely sentient sword. But the play is the thing here, and it’s an enthralling one, unspooling out like a sinewy, thoroughly masculine collision of “Braveheart,” “Beowulf” and “Game of Thrones.” But it’s also transporting, enveloping viewers in its mist-shrouded ethos and then, as if through some sort of spell, holding them there, spellbound until the bloody end. Credit there, of course, is due to the terrific cast. It’s led by a far-beefier-than-you-remember Alexander Skarsgård (“The Legend of Tarzan,” “True Blood”) as the ferocious Prince Amleth, who — after the film’s opening betrayal — we learn has grown up to become a fearsome Viking berserker, raiding villages and raising holy hell. In keeping with Viking tradition, which Eggers and company painfully researched and worked hard to authentically replicate, berserker Amleth channels his spirit animal when in the heat of battle. In this case, he has two: a bear and a wolf. So, yeah, he’s a force to be reckoned with, and Skarsgård imparts upon him a suitably grim stoicism. Murder is his game, and he takes it seriously. Skarsgård’s performance is the linchpin to the whole bone-crunching drama, given that he’s in nearly every frame. But he’s aided by a stellar supporting cast that includes Nicole Kidman in yet another award-worthy turn, along with Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Anya Taylor-Joy and the musician Björk, making her return to the big screen following a nearly two-decade-long absence. The film’s technical elements are universally exceptional, from its cinematography to its score to its blood-soaked fight sequences, which are beautiful and horrible all at once. Just as important, though, is Eggers’ thrilling narrative unconventionality, as he dispenses with cookie-cutter techniques and creates worlds rooted in recognizable reality but fringed with an ethereal, intangible brand of magic. His vision and his voice make Eggers a singular filmmaking talent, a member of that club of auteurs — maybe a dozen strong — whose work is always, unfailingly worth experiencing. WHEN AND WHERE: Opens Friday (April 22) at the Broad Theater, Canal Place, Elmwood Palace, Clearview Palace, West Bank Palace, Hammond Palace, Covington Movie Tavern, Regal Covington, Slidell Grand and Kenner Grand."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," The magic of Robert Eggers’s breakout first film, The Witch, a horror fable about a Puritan family besieged by supernatural forces, lay in its authenticity. Not from the close attention to period detail, though that was itself impressive, but from the earnestness of its tone, which presented every supernatural element as matter-of-factly as the grim realities of corn farming in 17th-century New England. That same practicality pervades Eggers’s newest work, The Northman, a violent Viking tale of loss and revenge. The film beckons you like a shaggy-haired stranger at a mead hall about to spin a yarn, one untouched by any modern awareness. In The Witch and his loopy next film, The Lighthouse, Eggers triumphed in generating the kind of thick, transporting atmosphere that envelops a whole theater. The Northman similarly plunges the viewer into a world that seems impressively alien. This is not a clichéd Viking landscape of lords in horned helmets who might look most at home on the cover of a heavy-metal album. Our hero, the deposed 10th-century prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), is a mud-streaked terror who looks as though he just crawled out of the ground, thirsty for vengeance against the man who killed his father; the crux of the narrative is whether Amleth can cling to a morsel of humanity as he tries to carry out that mission. The original Scandinavian legend was an inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and the basic plot of The Northman may therefore sound familiar. As a young boy, Amleth sees his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), get murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who then seizes the throne and marries Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Amleth escapes, and although his path back to Fjölnir is circuitous, his enthusiasm for retaliation never dims. Eggers presents Amleth’s quest as both a worthy obsession and an undeniable hindrance. He hones the character into a living weapon, crafted for a singular, bloody purpose. During Amleth’s phantasmagoric coming-of-age ceremony, he envisions himself as part of a long dynasty of warriors, each sprouting from a massive tree. Eggers peppers in these supernatural interludes throughout, with bracing deadpan; this world blends the gritty realism of warfare with intricate myth. The Northman sees Amleth commune with the astral projection of a mystic seer, fight a walking skeleton to claim a special sword, and chat to the disembodied head of an old friend. These moments are allowed to be fanciful and thrilling, but they’re also presented as necessary steps on the ladder Amleth climbs to his ultimate goal. The Northman is light on romanticism about the era; after his father’s death, Amleth retreats and becomes a berserker warrior, plundering coastal villages with amoral intensity and barely flinching as he watches innocent civilians get put to the sword. Eggers’s prior two films thrived on nightmarish intimacy and a small ensemble, but he presents the massive scale of these raids with brisk clarity. Eventually, Amleth’s military escapades are interrupted by the seer (a joyously weird one-scene performance by Björk) and, later on, the news that his uncle has settled in Iceland with Gudrún. Amleth poses as a prisoner of war to get shipped there and finally face his adversary. Amleth’s mission is compelling in its purity, and while Eggers quite deftly dodges any simplistic or swooningly heroic moves, he similarly doesn’t castigate his protagonist for the bloody life he’s chosen. Amleth really is a bare-chested, ax-swinging Prince Hamlet, a dog chasing a ball who clearly has no real sense of what he’ll do when he catches it. On his trip to Iceland, he meets and forges a connection with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), another prisoner of war who deems herself a sorceress but, more important, offers Amleth an escape from his cycle of brutality. Rather than chase Fjölnir, he could pursue a more ordinary existence with Olga. Eggers takes great care in situating that lifestyle in the unique environment of 10th-century Iceland, a free state for farmers and a centuries-long, unofficial experiment in quasi-democratic governance. The Northman thrives because of the attention to world building from Eggers and his co-writer, Sjón (an Icelandic poet who also co-wrote the 2021 film Lamb). In dramatizing the internal tug-of-war between Amleth’s grim, fated destiny and the opportunity for a more mundane life as a farmer, Eggers indulges both the grand folklore of the Viking age and the commonplace reality that shaped it, successfully creating an odyssey that feels grounded in the actual demands of civilization. The final act of The Northman is as violent and intense as a story that inspired Hamlet should be, but all the gore and swordplay would leave no lasting impression were it not for the sincerity of Eggers’s vision."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Early in The Northman, a Viking epic from arthouse favorite Robert Eggers, a wise man asks a king and prince to prove they are men. The nobles, crawling on their hands and knees, growling and howling like dogs, respond with a respective belch and fart. In doing so, both prove they’re “wise enough to be the fool.” The scene demonstrates a guiding philosophy in Eggers’ work that values historical reality over audience expectation. The sprawling, panoramic production conveys Viking life with authentic details, telling a vast and gory tale of revenge centered on Alexander Skarsgård, who helped develop the film. Eggers doesn’t shrink from realities that might seem silly, cruel, or divisive today. Much like the singular ambition of its central warrior, The Northman reaches for historical and mythological accuracy, refusing to bend to modern sensibilities to soften the blow of anthropological interest. That artistic choice results in refreshing and brave filmmaking, but it’s also distancing. In a sense, Eggers does not care if the moviegoing public comes away having learned about themselves or achieved some measure of catharsis. The film serves the internal needs of its protagonist, nothing more. The conceit is admirably single-minded.  Then again, Eggers combines period-accurate historicity with an otherworldly tendency in each of his three features. His debut The Witch (2015), shot in austere natural light and claustrophobic spaces, and using stripped-down production values, took place in a New England forest and drew much of its dialogue from actual journals written around 1630. However, the haunting elevation in the finale is a pure folk horror movie flourish. His follow-up, The Lighthouse (2019), a film that I have come to love since my original lukewarm review, employed vintage cameras to capture stark black-and-white images, lending the appearance of an old photograph to match the nineteenth-century locale. Yet, Robert Pattinson’s wickie finds himself overcome by nautical folklore, including a mermaid, tentacles, and an old story about the dangers of killing seabirds. Finally, The Northman features an equal helping of mythos embedded into the screenplay by Eggers and his Icelandic co-writer Sjón. Although they sourced Viking historians to ensure the accuracy of their research, including scant archeological evidence compared to other ancient cultures, the writers also infuse rituals, magic, and prophecy into the mix.  Drawing from the same medieval Scandinavian legend that inspired Hamlet, except set around 900 A.D., the story follows Amleth (Skarsgård)—a Viking dead set on hunting down his half-uncle Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) to avenge the death of his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). At ten years old, Amleth (played by Oscar Novak) witnesses Fjölnir take the throne and the widowed Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) for himself. Amleth escapes, his half-uncle believing he died during the violent coup. Years later, the Prince, having pledged himself to vengeance, has spent years transforming himself into an unstoppable behemoth in a band of berserkers, raiding Slavic villages, biting off faces, and burning alive anyone who cannot be sold as a slave. In their latest conquest, Amleth meets a seer (Björk), who sets him back on the path of revenge. He also meets a cunning slave named Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), and together, they’re sold as slaves to Fjölnir, who has resituated in Iceland. Their plan entails terrorizing Fjölnir’s camp from within before Amleth confronts his enemy.  Whereas Eggers’ two arthouse films before this could hardly be called straightforward, they both had a linear trajectory: The Witch moved upward toward the treetops; The Lighthouse spiraled down into Davy Jones’ locker, metaphorically so. Nevertheless, to watch them is to grasp at their oblique and unconventional execution, only to realize the journey Eggers has set into motion by the end. By contrast, The Northman’s narrative linearity pursues a traditional revenge story path, stalking one objective to the next until the fateful conclusion. Amleth must acquire valuable items—such as a mythic sword held by an undead warrior—before he can face the ultimate boss battle. This structure at first seems like a video game but mirrors the narrative order of the monomythic hero, the stuff of Gilgamesh and Odysseus. Eggers tells the story without a smidgen of irony, without a note of heavy metal guitar or Led Zepplin on the soundtrack, which will make audiences accustomed to deflating snark or obvious referencing to antecedents squirm from its seriousness and brutality. Expect uncomfortable laughter throughout from unprepared moviegoers. The lack of irony and meta-ness serves the Viking frame of mind and The Northman’s theme of fate. Within the first 15 minutes, King Aurvandill and his jester-seer (Willen Defoe) reveal Amleth’s fate and declare there will be no escaping it. Eggers never wavers from that bearing, constraining the viewer to Amleth’s mindset and grim morality that place vengeance, an honorable death in battle, and his arrival in Valhalla above all else. A post-modern Viking story might take issue with this morality and find Ameth questioning his origins, but not here. With his fate pulling him relentlessly toward his objective, he barely stops to question his motivations when given new information that should divert him. Amleth has such an obstinate determination for vengeance and death in battle that he might be a dull character if not for his peerless certitude. Moreover, even supernatural forces align with him. Fate operates like a force of Nature here, helping Amleth fulfill his destiny by curbing his actions with a sword that cannot be unsheathed at the wrong time; fate also prevents others from taking action that would upset his journey. Eggers’ willingness to embrace this element removes any chance of Amleth diverting from his quest and speaks to the singular aim of the Viking.  Quite the contrary, the film is remarkably immersive and convincing (even if the English-language dialogue and Scandinavian accents create a rare historical break in the production). Linda Muir’s effective garbs don’t look like ornate fantasy pieces but practical clothing made from the materials of the day. Sound designer Jimmy Boyle creates another rapturous layer with haunting sonic effects that make good use of every speaker in a surround sound system. The Northman is also a shockingly violent story. When Amleth and Olga plan a campaign of fear and terror on Fjölnir’s soldiers, the horrific result speaks to the twisted limits of Amleth’s mind, action, and morality. Above all, Blaschke’s imagery uses the same grandiosity that inspires Amleth—the kind of imagery that exists in the mind of someone who believes in his fateful ascent to Valhalla. Indeed, the whole thing ends with Amleth and Fjölnir battling atop a volcano in the buff, a scene that doesn’t quite challenge similar nude combat in Ken Russell’s Women in Love (1969) or David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises (2007), but it remains downright intense nevertheless.  Eggers’ only misstep lies in his all-star cast, some of whom fail to disappear into their roles. Kidman’s performance feels better suited for a standard Hollywood spectacle, for instance, with showy scenes for the camera. Elsewhere, and this is nitpicky, but consider it the bane of my existence that Alexander Skarsgård will forever be the Goth vampire—named Eric Northman no less—from HBO’s True Blood. He never quite shed that association for me, even in his subsequent and iconic roles as Tarzan or Randall Flagg. Here, Skarsgård looks Olympian, his body sculpted into a warrior’s physique, his massive shoulders pushing his head forward and down. When he first raids alongside the berserkers under a wolfskin, his hair appears long and shaggy, his beard unkempt. Then, Amleth resolves to disguise himself as a slave to get to Fjölnir. When he does, Amleth gives himself a haircut and trims his beard down, and he comes away looking distractingly polished—like he just dropped $150 at a salon. Where did he learn to cut his hair with such expertise? It looks like Eric Northman playing Viking dress-up. In a film where every surface detail has been meticulously researched and doubtlessly verified by scholarly sources, Amleth’s haircut and trimmed beard look curiously hip. But don’t let that bother you as it does me.  On the press tour to promote The Northman, the Swedish-born star has shared memories of growing up around towering rune stones and listening to his grandfather recount Viking legends. When, by chance, he met Eggers in Iceland five years ago, the two talked about making a Viking film. They called it fate. Incidentally, fate is the most compelling aspect of the film. But Amleth is less in a relationship with fate than at its service, robbing him of dimension as a hero. Once the viewer recognizes that Amleth will not leave or escape his current path, the viewer may feel somewhat detached and uninvolved, just watching the inevitable occur as a sort of anthropological case study. Even so, Eggers has constructed a gorgeous, bloody affair whose magical visions of zombie warriors and valkyrie riders and the gates of Valhalla place us inside our hero’s unwavering mindset. It’s a film splattered with blood, mud, and literal guts, but there is also music, dancing, ghosts, and tradition. Eggers deploys each aspect of Viking culture to incredible effect without judgment, and that’s a rare thing in any historical film today. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman, Robert Eggers’ biggest and most expansive (and expensive) feature to date, is also his best so far. It’s an oft-stunning visual feast and an entertaining peek into Eggers’ instincts as a choreographer not only of historical detail but of bloody action. It is also an instructive example of how the most visionary intentions can’t always enliven an otherwise rote story. The Northman opens in AD 895, when Amleth, the Northman of the title, is a boy (played at this stage by Oscar Novak). But it is primarily set in 914, during the latter stages of the settlement of Iceland, before the establishment of a parliament. Lawlessness rules the way.  Spare us your wild West and give us, instead, your wild, ravenous, revenge-seeking North.  Amleth’s father is King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), freshly home from battle — and suffering from an injury which, if not a mortal wound, has invited some dark reflection on mortality from Aurvandill’s part. “I watched his innocence tonight,” the warring king says to his wife, Queen Gudrún (an underutilized Nicole Kidman), of their son. It is time to initiate their boy into the ways of being king. So begins the first thrilling ritual we see in this movie. Amleth and Aurvandill crawl down into a cave, joining the fool of the kingdom, Heimir (a zany, senseless Willem Dafoe), in a howling, sputtering ritual of man-making, getting down on all fours like dogs as they inhale hallucinogenic smoke from henbane seeds and recite some of the sayings of Odin (the Hávamál).  Aurvandill’s sudden concern for showing his son the way of the throne in this rite is well-timed. Soon, the king will be betrayed by his brother, Fjölnir (a royally maned Claes Bang); an argument will ensue; Amleth will be rendered into an orphan, his mother into the unwitting queen of the man who’s stealing the kingdom from her son. Fjölnir, we learn, is a “bastard” — not in the line of succession. He also thinks Amleth has been, as they say, taken care of. He’s wrong. Only three movies into his feature directing career, Eggers has rightfully earned a reputation for doing his research. The Witch, from 2015, was set in the New England of the 1630s, and seemingly every detail of its presentation, from the library-antique style and rhythm of its dialogue to the painstaking reconstructions of its built environments, sang with his obsessive attention to detail — so much so that it nearly overwhelmed the movie. For The Lighthouse (2019), set in the 1880s, Eggers spent a handsome chunk of the movie’s budget on the construction of an actual, 70-foot tall lighthouse, within and around which he set the movie’s strange, confined story. For that movie, Willem Dafoe had to learn how to knit. None of which is remarkable on its own. Actors acquire practical skills for movies all the time. And James Cameron built a partial model of the Titanic only to sink it. For this level of care to embed itself in our idea of the director, though, is something else — a feat of canny marketing, for one thing.  The Northman is, unabashedly, a revenge tale. Amleth the boy will become Amleth the muscled, scorched-earth man: thwarted Viking royalty who, you’d better believe it, plans to avenge what he lost. Alexander Skarsgård, who once played Tarzan, has done the mean, lean, shirtless warrior thing before. It helps to have an actor who makes the feat of this accomplishment feel plausibly heroic, perceivably vicious. The Northman will see him falling in with a group of Viking-era berserkers, sheathed in the skin of a wolf, before having an encounter with a seeress (a mystically appropriate Björk) who spells out the story of his fate. Fate takes him to Iceland, as an enslaved laborer, and he works his way up into Fjölnir’s confidence through his wits and might. He befriends and falls for Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, who starred in The Witch and here, as there, drums up the sense of uncanny mystery that Eggers needs). Amleth communes with ravens and wolves, wends his way through a series of challenges to his will and his power. 

The Northman is not a cliffhanger, exactly. You know where the story is going. You can also, from the bare outline of the plot, guess where it came from. Amleth is a historical Viking warrior, described in the 13th-century historian Saxo Grammaticus’ The History of the Danes. Amleth, the name, resembles Hamlet for a reason: Shakespeare was influenced by the violent hero’s story. This movie’s particular chapter isn’t in Grammaticus’ account, however. It’s more so a plausible missing chapter, which Eggers co-wrote with the Icelandic poet Sjón. Still, for a story dreamed up by its makers, it starts to bear some cumbersome familiarity. Even the challenges that fall into Amleth’s path, such as the acquisition of a uniquely powerful sword, are a little deadened by obvious outcomes. 

Some movies can do this and not suffer for it. Northman’s cutting depth of detail almost longs for some fresh backbone of a story. The movie’s carefully constructed cliff-top forts and beauteous locales, its dangerous headlands and rolling green hills, are all so fecund — boons to the imagination. Eggers’ movie is best when it feels most complicit in that imagination: When it dives into its mystical visions and unnameable powers. Eggers abandons stylish modern crutches, like handheld cameras during his battle scenes, and instead resorts to smooth, eerie long takes, images that roam through the action, not with a sense of hands-off distance, but rather with a patient eagerness to lap up the sights, soak in the bloodletting. Nighttime scenes set outdoors are spookily drained of color and forced to evoke the wondrous, ominous purity of moonlight.  It’s disorienting. At times the movie tugs us back into its plot in ways that nearly disrupt the natural sense of curiosity Eggers makes us feel about this world. His sense of control lends itself to incredible, singular visions — a strong case, if nothing else, for selling edibles in movie theaters. Yet control winds up feeling, at times, like a limit. The story almost feels too linear for its visions: The attractive shock of the design demands plotless immersion — but wait, there’s an incesty plot-twist to get to, and wait, some of those people lurking in the background have got to die first. For a deeply violent guy, Amleth is actually quite morally grounded. He always has his reasons; even his time with the berserkers is intriguingly focused, constricted by his own moral restraint. His main identity, as a hero, is as a man who accepts his fate — owns it, lives up to it, trusts that what is meant to happen will happen.  In a recent profile of Eggers, the New Yorker claimed that The Northman might be “the most accurate Viking movie ever made,” and seems to mean this as a compliment. The truth is that Eggers pulls off something more interesting than accuracy, in part by abandoning what could ever possibly be known. The finer touches may or may not be rooted in historical truth, but their sum, at its best, can make your head spin. Ritual is, here as before in Eggers’ work, a grand occasion for the movie to pause, set aside the plot, and dive into the quirks and kinks and historial behavior. One of the best ideas in Eggers’ work to date is that the past is so much wilder than the present allows itself to be. That kingmaking ritual underground, between father and son, is a breathtaking feat of conceptual vertigo, a cascade of attractively nightmarish visions slipping down in front of our eyes like a reel of images. The costumes, the sets, the careful chaos: You could throw all of this onscreen and call it a movie, but Eggers routinely makes it feel flesh-born, equally grounded in the inconceivable and the plausible. You needn’t know that the crowns atop the royals’ heads don’t strictly fit the actual period to be taken with the curiosity of the choice. And even if you attribute the choice to style, rather than research, that style pulls you into the folds of a story that can almost feel too dangerous to watch. The violence gets gruesome. Children clubbed in the head, villages raided, homes leveled by fire, bodies battered by the elements. We don’t need to ask why we’re watching. In its own cruel way, it’s all so daringly fun.  What Eggers seems to know is that the tales of Grammaticus and others were tales spun in a Christian era, heavily reliant upon prior stories and myths but nonetheless distanced, by religion, from their more pagan roots. That gap could feel like a domestication of some more unwieldy spiritual power. Eggers wants to remind us that it’s all a little unhinged. The plot of The Northman does eventually make strides toward that what-the-fuckery, but the surprise comes from a couple of characters unexpectedly turning out to be freaks, which is perfectly fine for this movie. So much of Amleth’s tale is tied down to his fate (which is to say, Bjork shows up to predict the rest of the movie, and the movie proves her right) that by the time we’re seeing two men battle to the death within a volcano, we’ve learned to reorient our expectations. We’re so used to the fire and brimstone and predictable largesse of sword-and-sandals stories like these that it starts to feel like enough for a movie to simply amaze us. 

More than anything, The Northman made me wonder what Eggers would do with a historically blank canvas, an act of storytelling divorced from old modes like the revenge plot or witchy self-discovery. This isn’t something that every obsessively detailed director makes us feel. It is, specifically, something that Eggers’ movies make me crave. More than his previous works — which also owe much of their power not to lived reality but to the disconcerting tug of mythology — Northman makes a case for what Eggers might pull off were he encouraged to drift even more completely into the realm of imagination. It’s the fantasies and visions that stand out. Less so the “story.” The Northman is as off-the-rails, internal, and speculative as Eggers has ever been. The craft speaks for itself. The next step for Eggers is to really let it fly. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers' commitment to verisimilitude means that he conveys every sweaty, grimy, bloody experience of the characters in vivid detail."
"Apr 21, 2022",NEGATIVE," Any film by Robert Eggers is guaranteed to be a striking
sensory experience, not only drenched in obsessively researched period detail
(like “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” this one boasts production design by
Craig Lathrop and costumes by Linda Muir) and swirling visuals, again by
cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (working here in color, but various shades, and
on locations in Northern Ireland and Iceland), but in a weird, enveloping sound
world courtesy of an exemplary design team and, in this case, a brawling,
unsettling score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough.  “The Northman” recreates, speculatively but
convincingly, a tenth-century Scandinavian world of primitive mysticism and savage
brutality.  Yet dramatically it leaves
something to be desired, especially in its lead performance. That may be surprising, since it’s based on the same
Norse saga that inspired Shakespeare to write “Hamlet,” and Eggers was joined
in creating the screenplay by the noted poet Sjón, who collaborated with
director Valdimar Jóhannsson on the script for last year’s remarkable
“Lamb.”  The result is, of course, a
revenge story, but one whose prosaic narrative doesn’t match the impact of its
poetic visuals and wild sounds. As the film begins, young Amleth (Oscar Novak), along
with his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), welcome his father King Aurvandill
(Ethan Hawke) back from a war expedition. 
The wounded king and Amleth together undergo the boy’s strange rite of
passage to manhood conducted by Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe), howling and
crawling about on all hours in a sacred cave. 
As they emerge, however, the king is attacked and killed by his brother Fjölnir
(Claes Bang), who also takes Gudrún for his own.  He orders Amleth terminated, but the boy
escapes, vowing vengeance on his uncle and rescue of his mother. With the passage of years, Amleth, now in the person of Alexander
Skarsgård, has grown into a fearsome member of a band of Vikings slaughtering
hapless villagers in the land of Rus. 
Upon hearing that Fjölnir has been driven from his kingdom into exile in
Iceland, he steals aboard a boatload of slaves being shipped there and joins
their number.  Among his fellow captives
is the beautiful sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), with whom he quickly
develops a special bond. The two make it to Fjölnir’s mountain ranch, where they
join his stable of slaves.  Amleth does
not take his revenge at once, instead ingratiating himself with his new master
by saving Gunnar (Elliott Rose), his young son by Gudrún, when the boy recklessly
involves himself in a vicious game of knattleikr.  Meanwhile, with the aid of a witch (Ingvar
Eggert Sigurðsson) he acquires through battle with a dark warrior a magic sword
he intends to use against Fjölnir. His reunion with his mother, however, does not go
well.  She reveals that she had been
stolen and raped by Aurvandill, and was behind Fjölnir’s murder of him; she
also tries to seduce Amleth.  Enraged, he
kills Fjölnir’s older son, the arrogant Thorir (Gustav Lindh), whose boisterous
coterie he had earlier murdered, leaving their bodies hanging grotesquely on a
wall, and tears out his heart in a calculated act of hatred.  But he is forced to surrender when Fjölnir
threatens to kill Olga, and suffers terrible punishment before he is freed from
his bonds by a flock of ravens. The acting is variable.  A few of the cast, like Hawke and Bang, show some restraint, and Taylor-Joy is lovely to behold, if glacial, but most play to the rafters, including Dafoe and a ferocious Kidman. The biggest problem, however, is Skarsgård.  Though brawny and well-muscled, and able to roar with the best of them, he remains a curiously hollow shell, as devoid of inner life as his Tarzan was a few years back.  It’s said that Skarsgård’s been trying to mount a Scandinavian epic like this for years, and undoubtedly brings commitment to what must have been a horribly demanding shoot.  But he leaves an emptiness at the center of the film that all of its many virtues can’t compensate for. "
"Apr 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Director/co-writer Robert Eggers has sought to make the definitive Viking movie, and while the film issues a guttural cry for theatrical viewing, it is built around such a basic revenge plot as to blunt those simple charms."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is a story of remembrance and retribution through the brutal lens of early North Atlantic tribes. It’s essentially Hamlet as told in the late 800s in the North Sea. Alexander Skarsgård is Amleth (hoo-hoo, clever) a displaced prince driven to live life through war and pillaging under another chieftain. As a boy, he witnessed the murder of his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and the kidnapping of his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) by his uncle Fjölnir the (now) Brotherless (Claes Bang). Amleth escaped into the sea and vowed vengeance. Many years later, on the heels of a prophecy and opportunity, this very large and very angry young man disguises himself as a slave to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill the man responsible for it all. Knowing his destiny was never anything more than revenge, Amleth makes an alliance with the Witch Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Together they choose the right moments, antagonize the wrong guards, and make way for a new kingdom in a new land – once their business is settled. The Northman is brutal in its primitive savagery. From early rituals of manhood to the wholesale destruction of villages for slaves, breeding stock, and giggles, Eggers never sacrifices the darkness for light, using torches, moonglow, and shadows as uncredited characters. Rituals lit by firelight are framed with a hallucinogenic edge, prophecies ringed in vines and blood read like tangible memories. It’s not hyperbole to say The Northman is gorgeous in its sweeping palette and the soundtrack has a pounding sensual rhythm that blends seamlessly into the unreal landscape populated by wise foxes, guardian ravens, and the maniacal eye of Willem Dafoe. While a lot of directors try to be edgy in their imagery or storylines, Eggers manages to present his stories just as they are, these misshapen children who grow to be fearsome beasts. These are simple tales told through cruelty and very present magic that resonates regardless of the setting. With every film, Eggers gets more comfortable with what he can achieve, shaping and molding folklore and mythologies with dark symbolism. This is not “elevated” horror. This is fear and terror and horror in 146 minutes, and during not a single one of those minutes did the story meander through airy exposition nor was it padded with side-quests to fill space. The landscape tells a story, the wildlife tells a story, and the sounds of everyday life round out the senses. The Northman is not an unfamiliar story, nor is it a sanitized, tentative tale of how things used to be with cool costumes, weird accents, and happy endings. This is an immersive experience meant for the largest screen you can get your eyes on with the volume turned up as loud as your neighbors will allow. It’s also not for everyone. It’s extremely violent because it is a movie about Vikings who were not known for their polite manner or general courtesy. If it breathes, it’s probably getting gutted or stabbed or shot through with an arrow. You may find your hand over your mouth more than once and if men, women, and children dying horrifically isn’t your cup of tea, I think Spiderman: No Way Home (2022) is still playing. The Northman (2022) is rated R for a lot. People are murdered, let’s put it simply, wars and fighting are to the death, throats are cut, and bodies dismembered to send a message. This is a movie about Vikings, not Smurfs. Please measure your tolerance for violence before seeing this film."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," The first sign that not everyone in Robert Eggers’ 10th-century Viking revenge tale “The Northman” has their priorities entirely straight comes early in the film, when the Viking king Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) returns home to the North Atlantic kingdom of Hrafnsey after a year of fighting overseas.  After trudging up on horseback to the snowy cliffside village, Aurvandil’s queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), greets him warmly and, after a hug for their son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), urges him to bed with her. Aurvandil, though, says he has something more pressing to attend to. Rather than join his wife, he takes Amleth to scurry around a fiery cave on all fours, half-naked and barking, while chanting manly oaths of honor with the court fool (Willem Dafoe).  It quickly turns for the worse. The brother of Aurvandil, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), cuts the throat of the king, assumes control and drags Gudrún off on his shoulders to take as his wife. Young Amleth — “just a puppy,” his mom had called him — flees in a rowboat on an empty sea, vowing his revenge. Where are we, exactly? Smack in the middle of the Scandinavian legend that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” But in this Viking ur-""Hamlet” (Eggers penned the script with Icelandic poet Sjón) there’s no existential hand-wringing for Amleth over duty and fate. He lives for vengeance. When we next see him, he’s a ferocious and muscle-bound marauder — “a beast, cloaked in man-flesh” — who would snap most stage-bound Hamlets like a twig. Amleth (a bulked up Alexander Skarsgård) is less likely to soliloquize with a skull than sever one from someone’s body.  Once he’s had his fill doing mean Viking stuff (there’s a beautifully and brutally staged raid of a Slavic village), Amleth brands himself a slave and slips onto a boat headed for Iceland, where Fjölnir has moved his kingdom to a verdant grassy hillside. Among the workers there is Anya Taylor-Joy, a veteran of “The Witch.” With justice tantalizing close, Amleth takes up arms against a sea of troubles. The  recent trend toward folklore in film can, in lesser movies, seem like the cinema version of a paleo diet. But Eggers’ films have carried the potency of myths resurrected and reanimated, and in doing so have unearthed rich new territory. “The Northman,” with a reported budget north of $70 million, is a bigger canvas and more archetypal. With sweeping Scandinavian vistas and a finale set among rivers of burning lava atop an ash-spewing volcano, “The Northman” is forged in a powerfully primal fire. It is, though a lean story, with not as much meat on the bone as its ambition may call for. The mythic simplicity is part of the point of “The Northman,” but the movie’s single-minded protagonist and its elemental conflicts verge closer to “Conan the Barbarian” territory than perhaps is ideal. Eggers’ film is only fitfully enchanting and squanders its mean momentum. Once Amleth returns home, he bides his time for the right moment, and the movie seems to be filling time with supernatural segues and comically grotesque killings. For the first time, it feels like Eggers is relying on pagan pageant more than psychology to drive the movie, and the result is a seance that doesn’t quite spellbind, despite a sincere effort to.  This could be chalked up to the dictates of a bigger budget production and the need to reach a wider audience, or an instinct of the movies that seems to count on howling, barking and shouting to grasp something primal that it can’t quite summon. The scenes with Amleth’s mother, with a fiery Kidman, perhaps comes too late in a film that, after a long journey, begins to more dramatically tug at the masculine myth it’s predicated on. Amleth’s vows aren’t an oath but a curse, thus proving another age-old adage: Never trust Willem Dafoe. “The Northman,” a Focus Features release in theaters on Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for strong bloody violence, some sexual content and nudity. Running time: 137 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," “The Northman” tells a very old story — maybe the same old story. A young prince seeks to avenge the murder of his father, the king, whose killer has usurped the throne and married the prince’s mother. That’s “Hamlet,” of course, but Robert Eggers’s new film isn’t another Shakespeare screen adaptation, bristling with Elizabethan eloquence, high-toned acting and complex, uncannily modern psychology. Eggers, who wrote the screenplay with the Icelandic novelist and playwright Sjon, has conjured this bloody saga out of the ancient Scandinavian narratives that supplied Shakespeare’s source material. His raw material, you might say, since “The Northman” insists on the primal, brutal, atavistic dimensions of the tale. Amleth, as he is called, is no student philosopher, temporizing over the nuances of being and nonbeing. He is a berserker, a howling warrior with ripped abs, superhero combat skills and a righteous cause for his endless blood lust. This is what I mean by the same old story. In modern movies, even more than in 17th-century English plays, revenge can seem like the most — maybe the only — credible motive for heroic action. Just ask the Batman. Truth and justice are divisive abstractions, too easily deconstructed or dressed up in gaudy ideological colors. Love is problematic. Payback, in contrast, is clean and inarguable, even if it leaves a mess in its wake. “Avenge father. Save mother. Kill uncle,” young Amleth repeats to himself as he flees the scene of his father’s death. These words propel him into manhood, as he grows from a wide-eyed boy played by Oscar Novak into a cold-eyed marauder played by Alexander Skarsgard. Amleth inhabits a world whose operating principle is cruelty, and Eggers’s accomplishment lies in his fastidious, fanatical rendering of that world, down to its bed linens and cooking utensils. If you’ve ever played Dungeons and Dragons, you may have encountered a dungeon master who took the game very, very seriously, attacking the task of fantasy world-building with excessive scholarly rigor and over-the-top imaginative zeal. That kind of player can be intimidating, but also a lot more fun than the average weekend geek. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"""Northman"" is relentlessly brutal, but the violence feels appropriate for a world in which there aren't any rules and where ""social change"" comes at the sharpened edge of an ax."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"There is swordplay, soap opera style revenge, surprising nudity, a howling ritual and a fight on an active volcano. But it can be viewed as a blood and guts old fashioned adventure through the filter of Robert Eggers. Why wasn't Nick Cage in this movie?!?"
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," I may not be as entirely in love with The Northman as many, though I do think it’s quite good. I am, however, definitely in love with the fact that after The Witch and The Lighthouse, which has budgets of approximately $5 and $11 million respectively, someone gave Robert Eggers a shit-ton of money (reportedly in the neighborhood of $90 million) to direct a bonkers-ass, borderline-hallucinatory Viking epic. And damn does he ever go for broke. It’s strange and esoteric and features both a White-Walker-looking Valkyrie with braces and Bjork playing a creepy no-eyed witch to provide a bit of context.  The plot of The Northman plays something like Conan by way of Apocalypse Now with a detour into Valhalla Rising territory. With just a dusting of Hamlet for good measure. When Amleth (an anagram of Hamlet, played by Alexander Skarsgard) is a young boy, his uncle, Fjolnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) kills his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and kidnaps his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Amleth escapes and vows to avenge his father and save his mother. Years later, now a hunky adult who takes every opportunity to remove his shirt despite the fact most of the movie takes place in chilly Nordic settings, he finally gets his chance for retribution. Along the way he falls in with the witchy slave Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Steeped in mythology and folklore, The Northman unspools like a dreamy nightmare of vengeance. Gods, spirits, and magic are all in play; Ethan Hawke and his young son trip balls and channel their inner wolves; brutal old-timey violence is never more than a moment away; Willem Dafoe gets to tell narsty, foul-mouthed jokes at the expense of the royals; and characters have awesome names like Finnr the Nose-Stub (because his nose gets cut off), Hallgrimr Half Troll, and He-Witch. After kicking off with a couple of major, barricade-leaping action set pieces, the film settles into a methodical, contemplative amble fraught with reveries and visions and a near-insatiable blood lust. For as nuts at the movie does get at times, it’s often restrained, almost timid. Like it sprints up to the precipice of being absolute insanity, but always pulls back at the last moment, never taking the total plunge, in both individual scenes and as a whole. For as outlandish as it aims to be, the result is almost conventional. In publicity interviews, Eggers has said he didn’t have final cut of the film, which may have influenced the finished product, but for all the building it does, it never fully gets to where it needs to go. 
Found your post interesting to read. I cant wait to see your post soon. Good Luck with the upcoming update. This article is really very interesting and effective.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ last two movies, The Witch and The Lighthouse, were set in New England. His latest film, The Northman, goes even farther north to Viking country, and it’s everything you’d expect in a movie about Vikings. It’s a giant slab of raw meat. It’s the sort of movie made to inspire whole albums of heavy metal music, where warriors do more than just vow, “We will drink blood from the wounds of our enemies.” They actually do it in close-up. It’s also a clever patch on Shakespeare’s Hamlet. There are movies that you call “visceral,” and then there are movies where a guy actually has his intestines pulled from his body. This would be the latter. Enough tweet-length reviews of this. Let’s look deeper. The story picks up in 895 A.D. on an island north of Britain, when young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) welcomes home his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), from a victorious war with his beloved brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). The king thinks his son is now old enough to be initiated into manhood rituals, one of which swears the boy to avenge his father if he should die in battle. This happens almost immediately afterwards, when Amleth sees his father ambushed and decapitated by Fjölnir and his men. Nineteen years later, an exiled adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has joined a tribe of Slav Vikings pillaging their way through Kievan Rus’ when a vision of a blind seer (Björk) and the news that Fjölnir has been deposed and exiled to Iceland put him back on his mission. He sneaks aboard a slave ship destined for Fjölnir’s village and bides his time there, waiting to kill his unsuspecting uncle until obtaining a sword named Draugr the Undead. How metal is that? The Shakespeare parallels don’t stop there, as Amleth confronts the skull of the court jester (Willem Dafoe) and says, “I knew him.” Later, he hides behind a tapestry before confronting his mother and Fjölnir’s queen (Nicole Kidman) in her bedroom — unhappily for him, his mother turns out to be closer to Lady Macbeth than to Gertrude. Eggers and co-writer Sjón (a songwriter and collaborator of Björk’s who has been writing movie scripts since Dancer in the Dark) combine these elements with less familiar ones from the Icelandic sagas and Beowulf. It’s stitched together adroitly, and Eggers fiddles with the sound mix to make Amleth’s encounters with supernatural beings uncannier. When our hero has a vision of a Valkyrie, it’s not some dewy Nordic maiden but a revenant that looks ready to tear off someone’s head. So many movies about Vikings never convince us that we’re watching anything but actors dressed like Vikings. This one’s chanting in Old Norse and Old Ukrainian makes the film far more persuasive. So do the off-the-charts levels of violence here, as Eggers employs smooth, disengaged tracking shots through the villages to show the Vikings slaughtering pregnant women and setting children on fire. I could have used some of The Lighthouse’s humor to provide some relief, although it is amusing that when Fjölnir finds two of his men dismembered by Amleth, he blames the Christians and their evil sorcery. Both Amleth and an enslaved Ukrainian peasant named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) have access to their own witchery that the other finds strange, which leads to a “how did they do that?” shot when she utters a spell bidding the winds to propel their sailboat, and the camera pans up from her face to the sail filling with air. The performances here are appropriately savage, and Bang, the Danish actor who played weak men so memorably in The Square and The Burnt Orange Heresy, impresses by conveying a bloodlust that persists even though it costs him everyone he cares about. That’s a running theme here. Amleth is given a chance to live a happy and peaceful life with Olga, and he abandons her and their unborn children to take his long-delayed revenge on Fjölnir. He might be right that the deposed king will keep hunting them unless he’s dead, but after a seer (Ingvar Sigurđsson) has given him a choice between love and cruelty, he picks the latter. The Northman brings his quest to an end by a burning lake at the gates of Hel, the afterlife realm from Norse mythology. Amleth’s macho Viking ethos of conquest and retribution leads to this desolate place of blood and ash and dead bodies as far as the eye can see. Seems like a bad way to end."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," I often take notes while watching a movie I’m going to review, and when THE NORTHMAN was over, I found that I had written very few. Which makes sense, because this isn’t a movie you respond to intellectually–which is not to say it lacks intelligence. It’s a brawny, lusty, bloody epic of big emotions and in-your-face intensity–a movie that happens to you as you’re watching it, both visually and aurally. (To the usual advisory to see it on the biggest screen possible, it should be added to catch it at a theater with a really good sound system.) THE NORTHMAN is exactly the kind of historical adventure one would expect from Robert Eggers, who made his bones with the much smaller THE WITCH and THE LIGHTHOUSE. Tinged throughout with horror and occult elements, this Viking saga recalls THE WITCH’s immersive obsession with historical detail and THE LIGHTHOUSE’s study of men and masculinity in extremis. (Not reminiscent of THE LIGHTHOUSE: Willem Dafoe’s role here pretty much amounts to a cameo appearance.) Written by the director with Icelandic novelist/poet Sjón, it tells a story that’s elemental rather than complex; indeed, it’s a simpler tale than either THE WITCH or THE LIGHTHOUSE, though the film runs significantly longer than either of those, at over two hours. As a result, there is ultimately a sameness to THE NORTHMAN’s emotional impact after a while, though the movie never entirely loses its hold. That tale is based on the classic Norse saga from which William Shakespeare drew the story of HAMLET, with its hero being Prince Amleth, first seen as the preteen son of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Theirs is a pagan world (Christianity is later denounced thusly: “Their god is a corpse nailed to a tree”) in which the young Amleth (Oscar Novak) and his father take part in a manhood ceremony that finds them both behaving and howling like dogs. Amleth is then forced to grow up fast when he witnesses the death of Aurvandil and the abduction of Gudrún at the hands of his scheming uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), setting in motion a revenge plot that will curdle in Amleth’s mind for years, until he has become a strapping warrior (Alexander Skarsgård) who is first seen indulging in the same kind of pillaging Fjölnir enjoyed. In this sequence and throughout THE NORTHMAN, Eggers shoots his action setpieces in long takes that draw you right into the grisly, barbaric mayhem, and establish this long-ago era as one without pity. Amleth has essentially become the same kind of man as the uncle he despises–until he learns that a boatful of newly captured slaves is to be shipped to Fjölnir. Hiding himself among their number, he ultimately arrives in the Icelandic community ruled by his uncle, who of course doesn’t recognize the grown-up child he once tried to kill. Thus Amleth is able to hide in plain sight as he puts into motion his plan to avenge himself and free his mother. While THE NORTHMAN’s overall tone is rooted in stark, visceral reality, it is shot through with touches of the supernatural and surreal that mesh well under Eggers’ direction. There are multiple oracles/witches pointing Amleth toward his destiny (including one played with fitting exoticism by Björk), while a key foe at one point is, in effect, a zombie. Then there’s Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, reuniting with the director from THE WITCH), a fellow slave with whom Amleth becomes romantically and carnally involved, who possesses otherworldly gifts of her own. The palpable mutual passion Skarsgård and Taylor-Joy bring to their scenes together helps offset the emphasis on vengeance and brutality that marks much of the emotion on view here, which is compelling for some time but does leave one desiring more variation to the tone and tenor after a while. There’s no denying or criticizing the unwavering commitment of the performances, though (and Kidman has an especially potent scene late in the proceedings). Same goes for the craft from top to bottom, always in support of Eggers’ relentless vision. The environments and outfits created by production designer Craig Lathrop and costume designer Linda Muir are occasionally heightened and always appropriate, and they and the striking locations in Iceland and Ireland are beautifully captured by the gorgeous, sometimes fire-lit cinematography of Jaren Blaschke (who was Oscar-nommed for THE LIGHTHOUSE and deserves another nod here). First-time film composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, whose background is largely in electronica, contribute a score that utilizes traditional instruments to alternately thundering and hypnotic ends. However you respond to THE NORTHMAN emotionally, it’s clear Eggers has made exactly the movie he set out to make, and that he can see his ambitions through as successfully on a megabuck production as he did in his previous, much smaller pictures."
"Apr 21, 2022",NEUTRAL," *** Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun’s debut is a distressing game of digital chicken. Essentially alone in the world, teenage Casey (newcomer Anna Cobb) grows immersed in an online role-playing game called World’s Fair. It’s a horror RPG, and Casey crafts videos suggesting increasingly dark personal fantasies and, like many users, plays at transforming into a new being. Both Casey and her online followers seem to know it’s all staged, but their joint push toward the terrifying cusp of believability adds to the game’s natural momentum. Even more, participatory concern is the movie audience’s role. Interspersed between YouTube and Skype collages, we glimpse a lonely girl packaging her unknown disturbance into a fantastical realm. The more we ask, “Wait, but could this part be real?” or “What actual trauma is driving this?” the more we’re also playing World’s Fair. It’s a fascinating investigation of the liminal space that fear inhabits once a filmmaker all but mediates reality out of scary movies, though that makes for a better concept than story. Likewise, Cobb’s terrifically vulnerable performance becomes more textual than emotional. Still, don’t doubt the psychological weight of a film this creative and intelligent. Zooming miles past Unfriended and its ilk, Schoenbrun’s work lives at the piercing edge of modern horror. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. PAM CUT, April 22-23. *** Michael Bay’s Ambulance is stupid beyond belief, but it’s also thrilling, terrifying and impressively brutal. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Danny, a career criminal who enlists his adopted brother Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to help steal $32 million from a Los Angeles bank in broad daylight. It’s an insultingly improbable setup—even if Will needs money for his wife’s “experimental surgery,” why would he agree to Danny’s delusional scheme in minutes? But once they steal an ambulance to escape the army of police officers on their trail, the movie gets into a volatile groove. By trapping a bleeding cop (Jackson White) and a hardened EMT named Cam (Eiza González) in the ambulance with the brothers, Bay creates countless possibilities for triumphant tension. When Cam has to use a hair clip to perform surgery, your heart skips a beat—and when snipers prepare to fire shots that could kill everyone in the ambulance, it nearly stops. Hyperactive editing and swooping camera movements make too much of the action a frantic blur, but there’s no denying Bay’s control over the exhilarating currents of fear that course through your mind and body as you watch. Based on a 2005 Danish film, Ambulance strikes its share of false notes, but unlike most modern action movies, it understands the difference between bombast and suspense. R.

It’s a film made to be loved—and, given the sheer eye-popping technical wizardry at play throughout, nearly impossible to hate. Michelle Yeoh is typically dazzling as Evelyn Wong, a misanthropic laundromat owner called upon to save the multiverse from her daughter’s worst self (Stephanie Hsu, in a role intended for Awkwafina). Evelyn is an underwritten character, but Yeoh brings a welcome authenticity to the film, even if a performance of such finely shaded nuance isn’t the best fit for the DayGlo sensationalism of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the filmmaking duo known as Daniels (Swiss Army Man). As with Terry Gilliam, Edgar Wright or any other avant-garde sentimentalist pressing restless rhythms and visual inventiveness into the service of a wholly undeserving story, the directors effortlessly pep up the slow parts and paper over the plot holes, but when the pace calms and the fireworks die down for an emotional climax, the film moves glacially. Inevitable? Perhaps, but it’s still disappointing that Everything Everywhere All at Once is less than the sum of its dazzling parts. R. JAY HORTON.

Rowling was unleashing five films based on a faux-academic textbook that she had assembled for charity, Harry Potter fans instantly knew two things about the coming Fantastic Beasts pentalogy: An epic saga wrung from a whimsical taxonomy was a terrible idea, and that mattered not at all. Despite the irrelevance of the concept, the IP-that-lived held enough power to birth a third adventure for cryptozoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), despite the recasting of big bad Johnny Depp, the transphobic rants from Rowling, and the tonal sea change from earlier entries’ Dr. Dolittle-esque period travelogue toward a secret agent yarn about a failed affair between arch-mages. While replacement Grindelwald Mads Mikkelsen lacks Depp’s cartoonish self-regard—which provided a romantic counterweight to the incandescence of Jude Law’s Dumbledore—his Hannibal/Bond villain brand of drolly effete cruelty brings a necessary gravitas to a story that moves through a Disney-fied Weimar Berlin with bounce and verve. It also helps that the screenplay (by Rowling and Steve Kloves) expertly seeds the voluminous exposition with fan-servicing nods, but scarcely requires prior knowledge of the titular future headmaster. Yes, this is still the Potterverse, but to the film’s eternal blessing, it needn’t always be. PG-13. JAY HORTON.

Jessica (Tilda Swinton), an orchid grower living in Medellín, Colombia, is awakened one night by a booming, unidentifiable sound. Along with insomnia, the noise becomes a fixture in Jessica’s life, heard only by her. In a long-term waking daze, she eventually heads into the mountains toward the sound’s origins. That said, to fixate on a Weerasethakul movie’s plot misrepresents its appeal; sensory exploration is the main attraction. In Memoria, time slows, stalls and reconstitutes itself in minuteslong unbroken takes of jazz quartets, hospital visits and even deeply poetic naps. Swinton is as committed as ever, giving a performance seemingly bare of desire, charisma and even makeup. Fans of Weerasethakul standouts like Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives may be easily swept away in the Thai director’s first (partly) English-language film, but it’s difficult to speculate whether the uninitiated will find Memoria more transcendent or just tedious. There’s little spiritual enrichment to Jessica’s alienation—rather, the movie gradually positions her and the audience as infinitesimal, with identity and logic as mere blips and coincidences in spacetime. The metaphysical mysteries of the universe boom and then retreat. PG. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Cinema 21. ** If you like your men handsome, violent and oozing self-pity, you’ll get a kick out of The Northman, a new take on the Scandinavian legend that inspired Hamlet. It’s a satisfyingly brutish mystical epic directed by Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse, The Witch) starring Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth, a comically obsessive Viking prince. When Amleth was a boy, his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) was murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who then married Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). By the time Amleth is old enough to seek revenge, Fjölnir has lost the kingdom to a rival ruler and become a farmer, which is one of the film’s many perverse jokes—Fjölnir can never fall far enough to sate Amleth’s fury. While Amleth’s macho theatrics could have been intolerable, they’re undercut by the film’s peculiar humor. There’s a charming self-amusement behind the exaggerated Scandinavian accents of the actors—they know they’re in a bonkers movie and they’re loving it. Plenty of audiences probably will too, but save for Queen Gudrún mocking her son with a beautifully mad cackle, Eggers is a director of divided loyalties—he rebukes toxic masculinity while reveling in it. Hypocrisy is by no means fatal, but despite a glorious climactic duel on a lava-drenched volcano, The Northman leaves weary familiarity in its wake. Critiquing men like Amleth and Fjölnir? Good. Leaving them behind? Better. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Yet Sonic the Hedgehog 2 understands what made Marvel’s 2012 superhero mashup a success: not apologizing for making a children’s movie starring a cast of shiny action figures that repeatedly get smacked together. Sonic’s latest adventure is unlikely to change the lives of anyone above the age of 12, but if Sega Sammy silliness is your jam, you’re in for a wild ride. Directed by Jeff Fowler, the sequel is dominated by a sense of exploration, earnestness and, above all, fun. The action is fast-paced and creative, some of the gags are genuinely funny, and the cast is game—Idris Elba in particular has a ball voicing the ever-stoic Knuckles the Echidna, making the character both an unflappable warrior and an overgrown child trying to convince everyone of his seriousness. Outside of Jim Carrey’s gleefully maniacal Dr. Robotnik, however, the film struggles to find a purpose for its human supporting cast, to the point you begin to wonder why they even bother. Ultimately, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is at best a mostly harmless romp that keeps you entertained, or at least distracted. PG. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is an excellent, unflinching, and immersive vision from filmmaker Robert Eggers. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with Björk collaborator Sjón, is painstakingly detail oriented when it comes to dialogue, and you can get lost in the lushness of the composition of his words. But he always gets his point across, and the story is easy to follow, shepherding the viewer along every step of the way even if they don't have a degree in 1,000-year-old linguistics.  The visuals are rich as well; some internal scenes are lit by flickering candlelight, and the climax takes place on an active volcano, or ""The Gates of Hell,"" as it's referred to in the film. ""The Northman"" feels like the culmination of Eggers' powers as a writer and director, taking his knack for creating moody atmosphere and his gift for words and staging them on an epic canvas. It's savage and raw, a tour de force caked in blood. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," To say that The Northman, the third film from writer-director Robert Eggers, is more conventional than The Lighthouse and The Witch is not to say that it’s conventional. The movie may be a familiar period revenge drama in terms of narrative, but it’s made—as the other films were—with blistering cinematic vision. To what end, however? The Witch dissected religious fundamentalism; The Lighthouse examined the madness of isolation. (That one especially hits differently in the wake of the COVID pandemic.) The Northman throws a few wrinkles into its vengeance story, but doesn’t offer up much food for thought. This is mostly a visual extravaganza of gritty historical detail, mythic imagination, and brutally horrific violence. Alexander Skarsgard stars as Amleth, dispossessed prince of a Nordic realm circa AD 900, who is hacking his way home to avenge his dethroned father (a convincingly burly Ethan Hawke in flashbacks). Bulked-up and brutish, Skarsgard stands as a worthy successor to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Conan the Barbarian, delivering a performance of impressive physical prowess (while avoiding the campiness). Returning from The Witch is Anya Taylor-Joy as an enslaved woman who brings “cunning”—to borrow her own character’s words—to Amleth’s cause. More star power arrives in the form of Nicole Kidman as Amleth’s icily regal mother. Eggers wrote the screenplay with Sjon, the Icelandic writer whose credits include the 2021 folk horror curiosity Lamb and Lars von Trier’s Bjork-starring movie musical Dancer in the Dark (Bjork has a cameo here as an elaborately adorned seer). What we get is a little Hamlet, but mostly a series of stunning set pieces. Eggers is a ritualistic filmmaker. Research drives his films, which play out as equal parts “living-history” reenactments and flights of fantastical imagination. And so we have an opening sequence of Hawke’s king and a young Amleth (Oscar Novak) barking like dogs as part of a wild initiation rite (“This is the last tear you will shed in weakness”); a Viking funeral punctuated with a shocking moment of sacrifice; an (imagined?) ride into the Northern lights with a Valkyrie; and—my favorite—a fireside prophecy involving Willem Dafoe’s lopped-off head. (That’s not really a spoiler.) When Eggers roots these moments in solid characters and sophisticated stories, they’re thrillingly immersive. When that foundation isn’t there, they can register as high-priced cosplay.  The Northman gestures toward complication with its ending, a striking silhouette showdown set against a backdrop of flowing lava. It’s riveting as action, yet the choice Amleth must make, which was predicted by Bjork’s seer, fails to deconstruct the notion of mythical heroism in any real way. (For that, see 2021’s The Green Knight.) Similarly, for all its grandiloquent landscape cinematography (Eggers regular Jarin Blaschke is behind the camera), the movie never tempers its barbarism with beauty or mercy, as was the case in something like Leonardo DiCaprio’s vengeful The Revenant. But for a rousing adventure yarn about screaming Norsemen, made by filmmakers who love to costume them, you could do far worse."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Visually stunning and painstakingly choreographed, The Northman perfectly measures up to its epic expectations."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"With his remarkable attention to folkloric detail, filmmaker Robert Eggers takes on Viking mythology in this bloodthirsty meditation on revenge."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," In The
Northman, the legend of Amleth, a vengeful Scandinavian prince, gets a
re-working from co-writer/director Robert Eggers, who's no stranger to literate,
historical dramas with elements of the supernatural. This version takes the
foundation, which certainly is more famously known by way of William
Shakespeare's own adaptation of the legend (The original name is a sort of
incomplete Pig Latin form of the name of the Bard's vengeful Danish prince), and
slowly begins to turn its straightforward tale of revenge inside-out. That's
the most fascinating thing about the narrative of Eggers and Sjón's screenplay,
which assumes we knoweither from one of the most famous plays in the history
of theater or from the assumed conventions of countless tales of
vengeancewhat will happen in this story, how it will occur, and why it has to
be that way. There's a deeper, more complex story within this, though, which
puts forth multiple questions about how and why we take those assumptions about
revenge, its traditional justification, and its supposedly balancing purpose for
granted. The movie introduces that notion, revels in the muddy morality of it
for a bit, and finally just takes the more traditional path anyway. To a
certain extent, the movie's hesitation to delve into its dissection of bloody
revenge is irrelevant. For a while here, the story is secondary to Eggers'
commitment re-creating the world of the Nordic lands of the 9th century, as well
as exploring its societal/cultural values and its religious beliefs/practices.
The basic thrust of this well-knowneven if people don't know exactly from
where it comestale is almost an excuse for Eggers to combine a grimy, brutal
sense of aesthetic realism with a haunting atmosphere of unnatural dread. That
authenticity and atmosphere takes this movie a long way. Once the story and the
underlying ideas about revenge come into sharper focus, though, the filmmakers
don't develop those with anywhere near the same rigor they do when it comes to
building the world surrounding them. An
extended prologue introduces us to a kingdom on a stormy peninsula somewhere in
the North Atlantic. King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) has returned from a lengthy war
campaign to Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his young son Amleth (played as a
child by Oscar Novak). Having been wounded in battle, the king wants to prepare
for his son to succeed him to the throne. Soon
after, the king is ambushed by soldiers loyal to his brother Fjölnir (Claes
Bang), who offers the coup de grace to Aurvandil. The prince escapes in a boat,
vowing to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. Years
later, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has become a ruthless warrior for a
conquering tribe (A one-take depicting Amleth's barbarity in battle offers that
and a showcase for Skarsgård's bestial physicality in the role). Following the
sacking of a village, he learns that Fjölnir has been deposed and is now a
farmer in Iceland with two sons, the younger from his marriage to Amleth's
mother. Pretending to be a captive slave, Amleth makes his way to his uncle's
farm, and unknown to his family, prepares for revenge. Obviously,
the story here is different from the original legend (It is enjoyable to see how
the screenwriters incorporate and twist elements of it and/or Shakespeare's Hamlet,
such as a scene in which the skull of a once-beloved court fool, played by
Willem Dafoe in the prologue, offers insight and a confrontation in the queen's
chambers, which transforms theat least as it's read by someincestuous
subtext of Shakespeare's scene into the actual text). Eggers and Sjón
essentially have reduced the tale to its groundwork. From
there, Amleth's scheme to psychologically destroy and ultimately murder his
uncle becomes one guided by religious rituals (A pair of witches, played by Björk
and Ingvar Sigurdsson, offer the vengeance-seeker a plan, and a spell-caster
named Olga, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, helps and comes to love Amleth) and aided
by relics of folklore (A magical sword must be retrieved from its undead
possessor, whom Amleth must fight). The real foundations for his goal, though,
are traditions of familial obligation and the contemporary code of what it means
to be a warrior and a man. Those
first two elements of the story give the movie's otherwise grounded and sparse
backdrop a mysterious air of imposing doom. This is a world in which prophesies
and enchanted weapons are as commonplace as rolling hills, stone-and-wood
edifices, and engrained cruelty (Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke gives a chilly
bleakness to the landscapes, but some tricks, such a monochromatic nighttime
scenes and visions of the supernatural, help to make the more fantastical
components just as vital and authentic). Visually,
all of this is engaging, but as Amleth learns some difficult truths about his
living and dead family, Eggers and Sjón start but fail to explore the ideas
they raise. Basically, there's another story of which Amleth has no knowledge,
but with the knowledge comes assorted questions about his code as a warrior, his
role as an avenger for his father, and his loyalty to a still-living family and
a potential one in the future. By the end of The
Northman, there are neither heroes nor villains to be found, but in the
movie's final rush toward a simplistic resolution, there's little acknowledgment
or examination of that idea, either."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," I blame Elden Ring. Ever since taking in the latest exercise in sword and sorcery masochism by the folks at From Software, something turned on in my brain. Suddenly, I couldn’t get enough of escaping into fantasy worlds, from Elric of Melnibone to Berserk to the Cosmere novels, even digging all the way back to “Two Gun Bob’s” Conan tales. I went so far as to hit eBay to pick up grody 60’s paperbacks of this material. If it’s got a muscular lunkhead ready to cleave some monster in two, I’m there. My inner 5 year old that loved He-Man finally is having his day again. All that to say, I couldn’t have been more primed to love this latest effort by Robert Eggers, which is a Viking antecedent to these types of tales. Though it would be more intellectually honest to say it’s based on the Scandinavian folktale that directly inspired Hamlet. Much like that routine piece of high school text, The Northman is a story of a father being murdered by a brother, and a son swearing revenge and the rescue of his mother. The son being Amleth (an exceptionally beefy Alexander Skarsgard, once he grows up), the progeny of Viking Warrior King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), who he witnesses being assassinated by his sibling Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang, one of the greatest actors alive, if you didn’t already know). This sends Amleth out into the world alone, eventually to be raised from boyhood amongst berserkers – raping and pillaging their way across the land of Rus. An empty husk of a being. But a chance encounter with a mysterious Seeress (Bjork) reminds Amleth of his life’s renewed purpose, i.e. killing the man who killed his father and captured his mother (Nicole Kidman). If it sounds fairly routine, it’s because as a piece of storytelling, The Northman’s source text is the definition of elemental; informing these types of revenge narratives for centuries. It’s what Eggers does to add his own personal stamp throughout that keeps the film’s intrigue alive. In addition to some wonderful visual flourishes – I was thrilled every time Amleth was able to trace familial lineage by touching someone’s blood – the film subverts our general expectations regarding the hero’s journey, while a broader sense of myth and fantasy exists just on the margins. Eggers has once again proven that of the class of horror filmmakers that emerged in the late 2010’s (which includes Ari Aster, Jordan Peele, Jennifer Kent, and David Robert Mitchell), he continues to be the most consistent and exciting member of that pack. Speaking of other directors, it’s a fascinating bit of timing to see The Northman released just one year past The Green Knight dropping. Both are obviously freshened takes on ancient legends, but they also serve as spins on a genre that’s entered a period of stagnation on the big screen, with Epic Fantasy and/or Sword & Sorcery being relegated to the world of television. While The Northman attempts to sell itself as an “epic historical action drama”, and is a bit guarded about whether its otherworldly moments are actually occurring or not, it’s fairly clear where Eggers’ roots lie – with one foot in the history books and the other in the pulps.  It’s actually that guarded nature that keeps me from fully embracing The Northman as superior to his previous triumph, The Lighthouse. While it’s a more accessible film (which is saying something for a movie that features naked men sword fighting in a volcano), ironically it feels like it needed to go just a bit weirder. I could have really gone for Amleth fighting some skeletons or a dragon or something. I jest a bit there, but there’s a stretch in the second act where a bit of drag sets in, and had Eggers spruced that up a bit with some baser thrills, I think this could have surpassed David Lowery’s work from last year. But this is a relatively minor complaint. To be frank, I don’t know that there’s ever been a movie more made for me, or at least the me of this very specific moment. It’s the kind of film that’s just aching to have its clips scored to Slayer on Youtube. And it continues the trajectory that Skarsgard has been on since The Diary of a Teenage Girl, namely that his strengths as a leading actor continue to grow, turning a relatively two-dimensional character on paper into something consistently arresting. If this is how we get our big screen Sword & Sorcery revival, with inward seeking filmmakers taking a stab at arguably the most externally pleasurable genre, sign me up. I love Nicole Kidman in many things, but this was not one of them. Her over the top acting towards the end of the film just threw it all out of sync for me – I wish Eggers would’ve asked her to tone down her shrieking because it was really ear-curling . Alexander Skarsgard and Anna Taylor-Joy exhibit great chemistry together and some of the cinematography sort of left me waxing nostalgia for John Boorman’s Excaliber. Another small thing about this picture I found annoying was the top billing of William DeFoe for what, three seconds of screentime playing a jester who nearly gets his head chopped off for telling a offensive joke? Jeez, same for Bjork, if you blink, you’ll miss her. The best attribute this film will walk away from is the brutality of the action scenes which will be worth the price of admission. It was the first film I got to see at my employer’s state of the art movie theater for the first time in over two years and as the credits finished rolling, a screenwriter who I happen to know asked me what I thought about it and I simply responded: “You know, I think I’ll stick with Vikings:Valhalla, if it’s all the same to you”."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," We’ll find out this weekend. Should you want to stay at home, you have numerous options, with HBO’s “We Own the City” being a standout. It drops April 25. “We Own This City”: Over six acclaimed seasons, HBO’s “The Wire,” set in Baltimore, redefined what a crime and cop series can say and achieve. Series creator David Simon returns to Baltimore here and once again examines the dirty dealings going on in the streets as well as the police force along with other public institutions in Baltimore and beyond. He tells these stories with his patented, cut-through-the-crap authority and clarity, welcome qualities both that distinguish the former Baltimore Sun reporter and filmmaker’s work. Here he reunites with many of his previous collaborators, including co-screenwriter/co-producer and decorated crime novelist George Pelecanos. They accomplish the near-impossible goal in exposing the rot, racism and corruption of a grind-’em-up system that flings open the doors for corrupt cops, finger-wagging, easily replaced politicians and a war on drugs that backfires in unforeseen, debilitating ways. “We Own This City” uses as its framework award-winning Baltimore Sun investigative reporter Justin Fenton’s 2021 book of the same name, and the result is an American pressure cooker that depicts what ails America’s law enforcement system and society at large. Told in six crisp episodes  that are directed with vivid documentary-like flourish by “King Richard’s” Reinaldo Marcus Green, “We Own this City” shuttles back and forth in time so it can illustrate how previous events helped create a powder keg of community outrage and distrust of Baltimore police that ignited after the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who died while in police custody. “City” jumps around a lot to lay bare a broken system that allows bad cops to plant evidence, skim drugs, cover up tracks, filch money in busts and over-inflate OT numbers. The central figure is Sergeant Wayne Jenkins (a perfectly cast Jon Berenthal in a performance that demands awards attention), the arrogant, popular leader of the Gun Task Force, but as Fenton’s reporting and “City’s” screenplay shows, Fenton had plenty of help. It’s chewy, meaty material without a doubt, but Simon and company don’t reduce it to hit-and-run talking points, nor do they talk down to the audience, giving us credit that we can keep up and focusing out the bigger picture that needs to be addressed not just now but in our future. Details: 4 stars; available April 25 on HBO/HBO Max. “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent”: The premise couldn’t be more promising: Have Nicolas Cage play Nick Cage. And while that idea and the bromantic pairing of Cage with Pedro Pascal (really terrific here) make “Unbearable” more than just bearable, the screenplay by director Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten plays it so loose that the comedy never comes together with the punch it should. The silly plot involves kidnapping and a trip by Nick to Mallorca, Spain, for a birthday party gig for his devoted fan, the ultra-rich Javi (Pascal) who has a screenplay poised to present to his obsession. So far so good, but while the comedy is quite funny at points (an acid trip taken by Cage and Javi features the best laughs), other moments feel like comedic driftwood. That’s true of the uncooked device of having Cage’s younger “Valley Girlish” self pop in and out. “Unbearable” shines brightest whenever it reaches into Cage’s canon for laughs and lets Pascal have his moments. You only wish there were more such moments instead of clunky action set pieces at the storyline involving two CIA agents (Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz, both not given much to do). Details: 2 stars; in theaters April 22. “The Northman”: If Robert Eggers’ previous arthouse features ended on a less than satisfying note, his $90 million Vikings epic slays the finale and then some. In fact, Eggers’ third film is his best, a riveting mainstream production that uniquely plays to his own vision. Alexander Skarsgård inhabits the seething soul of his “Hamlet”-like character Armeth, who’s out to avenge a violent injustice that lands him in Iceland of the 9th century. He’s fighting mad and setting his killer sights on his uncle Feng (Claes Bang) who’s now with his mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman, who ironically played  Skarsgård’s wife in HBO’s “Big Little Lies”). Eggers’ film is a brawny, bloody affair, a rich broth of earthiness and Scandinavian lore, that gets ladled out well via a poetic screenplay from Eggers and novelist Sjón.  Skarsgård is at his rage-filled best, as tightly coiled and poised to strike as a cranky rattlesnake. As in every Eggers film — “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — the mood, the detail and the look of this production is extraordinary. And the fiery showdown at the end is incomparable. Details: 3½ stars; in theaters April 22. “They Call Me Magic”: Sports docuseries fall into any number of traps, from getting too personal to succumbing to salaciousness to simply fawning over their subject. There’s no doubt that director Rick Famuyiwa is indeed a fan of Earvin “Magic” Johnson. But his four-episode Apple TV+ series on the former Los Angeles Lakers star, humanitarian and savvy entrepreneur holds steady. Stuffed with thoughtful interviews with teammates, on-court rivals (yes, the Chicago Bulls’ Michael Jordan), coaches, journalists and even former presidents as well as insight skimmed from conversations with the besties of his wife, Cookie, as well as his family and children, “Magic” gives us a lot of material, all of which creates a full-bodied portrait that leaves very little curiosity unanswered. It also honors the different personas and many accomplishments the five-time NBA champion made on and off the court. Even if you have zero interest in basketball, this docuseries will draw you in and inspire you. Details: 3 stars; available April 22 on Apple TV+. “Captive Audience: A Real American Horror Story”: In Hulu’s engrossing three-part docuseries the adage that truth is indeed stranger than fiction sadly proves out. Director Jessica Dimmock relates the tragic, shocking story of two crimes, one the 1972 kidnapping in Merced of 7-year-old Steven Stayner, who escapes with another boy and then returns to his family when he’s 14; and the other a tale of murder near Yosemite. Dimmock takes an unorthodox approach by having the actors who portrayed Steven (Corin Nemec) and his older brother Cary (Scott Curtis) read taped interviews that the co-writer of the well-regarded 1989 miniseries “I Know My First Name Is Steven” conducted. It’s off-putting initially, but that conceit pays off powerfully in the third episode. “Captive Audience” fails to shed significant new light on well-covered subject matter, but it does convey how notoriety and the demand to craft a happy ending when there’s simply none to be had chews up lives. Details: 3 stars; available April 22 on Hulu. Related Articles

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," It is a wild and trippy ride that mixes “reality,” with sequences that dip into the mystical world of the Vikings, and back out again. It’s also meticulously made, with an attention to detail as close to actual 10th century Viking life as is possible. Ten-year-old  Prince Amleth, (Oscar Novak), is excited to welcome his beloved father King Aurvandil, (Ethan Hawke) back to their rocky island home. That night, in a hallucinatory ceremony, Aurvandil and the court’s jester/shaman Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe) initiate Amleth as heir to the throne.  But the joy is short lived. The next day Amleth watches his uncle Fjölnir, (Claes Bang) murder his beloved father, carry off his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and claim the throne. Amleth escapes to sea vowing to return, to save his mother and avenge his father. In the aftermath of one brutal assault, Amleth wanders trance-like, and encounters a seer (Björk), who tells him his time has come. Vengeance is thrown a curveball though, with the news that his uncle has lost his throne and now runs a farm in Iceland.  When some captured villagers are to be sold as slaves to his uncle, he boards the slave-ship as one of them, meeting a captured witch onboard named Olga of the Birch Forest (the literally entrancing Anya Taylor-Joy). In Iceland, Amleth slaves away, discovers his mother’s fate, and hatches violent schemes. Welcome to the world of Robert Eggers.  The Northman is his third film, and even though it’s his biggest budget yet, and possibly his most mainstream, it has his very distinctive trademark moves. As wild a ride as his films are, Eggers is a stickler for historical detail. The sets, the costumes, the artifacts, the way of life were all designed to be as accurate to the period as is possible. In The Northman, Eggers’ authenticity means brutal conditions and brutal battles, and strong characters, both male and female, whether in war, or in love. Even the story’s flights into the mystical world are based in the Viking and Nordic beliefs of the time. To create the story for this film, Eggers teamed with Icelandic novelist and screenwriter Sjón. The two dug into Viking history and culture, sagas, poems and Danish legends, one of which was the story of Prince Amleth. That 12th century saga, was also the source material for Shakespeare’s Hamlet, (Hamlet is an anagram of Amleth). There are obvious similarities between the two storylines, but this Prince has none of Hamlet’s angst.  To prepare for the role, he’s buffed up impressively, and that physical intensity is matched by emotional force.  He’s well matched with the other players in this drama, including Kidman, Danish actor Bang, and Bjork as a seeress who reminds Amleth of his destiny.  The two Eggers regulars, Dafoe and Taylor-Joy are especially compelling.  The Northman is big and mythic and violent, and wonderful. It threatens at times, to go over the top, but it never does. Robert Eggers, once again proves that he’s not only a filmmaker with his own crazy and specific vision, but that he has the skills to pull it off.  There are rumours that hIs next film will be a remake of Nosferatu. I can hardly wait.  The Northman written by Robert Eggers and Sjón, directed by Robert Eggers.  Starring Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ana Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe and Ethan Hawke. The Northman opens in theatres Friday, April 22."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers is an idiosyncratic filmmaker whose previous films, “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” have more in common with silent era movies and formal stage presentation than they do with the blockbusters that rule today’s box office. His latest, the violent Viking drama “The Northman,” now playing in theatres, has all the hallmarks of Eggers’ work, but despite the inclusion of old Norse language, mysticism and its occasionally psychedelic tone, it may be his most accessible movie yet. When we first meet Amleth, the Viking warrior prince, played as a teen by Oscar Novak, as a muscle-bound adult by Alexander Skarsgård, it is the year AD895 somewhere in the North Atlantic. He is a child about to enter the line of succession to one day take over from his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke). An unspeakable act of betrayal interrupts Aurvandill’s plans for the future, forcing Amleth to flee the only home he has ever known, leaving behind his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Years pass. Adult Amleth is now a fierce warrior with revenge on his mind. When the would-be prince and his band of berserkers ravage a village, the locals who survived the carnage are sold off as slaves. When Amleth learns the purchaser is the man who betrayed his father, he disguises himself as one of the prisoners with a plan to get close to the man who destroyed his life and family, and earn back his honor. “I will haunt this farm like a corpse returned from the grave,” he declares. On the journey he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress who becomes his ally and love interest. “You are still a beast cloaked on man flesh,” she tells him. His strength, she tells him, will break their bodies. Her cunning will break their minds. Amleth’s journey is also a spiritual one, driven by mysticism and the words of a whispering seeress played by Björk. ““Remember for whom you shed your last teardrop,” she says, sending him off on his mission. Eggers seamlessly blends the supernatural and the nature until the lines blur into one trippy whole. “The Northman” is based on the Scandinavian legend that influenced William Shakespeare‘s beloved “Hamlet.” It’s a familiar story of payback, violent, visceral and vengeance-filled, but Eggers’ singular vision, and fondness for pathetic fallacy, ancient symbolism and psychedelia, make it a singular experience. Amleth chews one man’s neck, killing him in a memorably bloodthirsty fashion, and that is before the revenge story comes into play. Eggers amps up the brutality, shooting long scenes in unbroken wide shots that provide full few of the action. This ain’t Michael Bay’s frantic cut and paste. It’s full coverage, carefully orchestrated violence that drives home the brutality of the battles. It’s ferocious, audacious—check out the showdown at the Gates of Hel—if occasionally unpleasant, stuff. It’s not all fun and bloody games, however. The storytelling gets bogged down from time to time and Amleth’s frequent vocalizing of his mission mandate—avenge his father, kill his uncle and rescue his mother—gets old after a while.

"Apr 21, 2022",NEUTRAL," There’s a lot about The Northman that is ancient and just as much that’s mythic. It’s Shakespearean in its bones, but touches of Confucius, Sophocles and Wolfram von Eschenbach are never far from reach. There’s even a surprising tribute to Disney’s The Lion King, which really shouldn’t be too surprising considering that both movies share similar source material. But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, the story: Viking King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) has been mortally wounded and worries he will not live to see his young prince, Amleth (Oscar Novak), grow to be a man. Amleth must be initiated, Aurvandil tells Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). He is but a boy, she protests. Nonsense, the dying king retorts; my grandfather ruled when he was 13. True, the fair queen responds, but he had to kill his uncle to do so. Even those unfamiliar with Shakespeare’s Danish play know director Robert Eggers is laying it on thick. The Northman is familiar territory for Eggers, even if it is his first shoot outside the U.S. and with a mighty budget ($80 million reportedly). What’s familiar is the historical research and period detail—or what I assume to be historical research and period detail. As with The VVitch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), The Northman is a particular brand of madness stitched together by scholastic study. Back to young Amleth—rhymes with Hamlet—who goes on the run after uncle Fjölnie the Brotherless (Claes Bang) murders Aurvandil in cold blood and takes Gudrún as his bride. Amleth vows to return to Iceland to murder his uncle, free his mother and reclaim his kingdom. Ah, the salad days of youth. Years pass, and Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) returns to Iceland with surfer’s abs, stooped shoulders and a one-track mind. He’s a warrior, and a pretty adept one at that, posing as a slave to get close to Fjölnie. I’m not so sure about the efficacy of Amleth’s plan, but it does get him close to Fjölnie. So close, Amleth could probably jump him and snap his neck. But Amleth waits. And waits. And waits a little more. For some, murder is murder. For Amleth, it’s delayed sexual gratification. The Northman is teeming with ambition. The ninth century is not a tidy time to be alive, and Eggers and co-writer Sjón wallow in the muck and mire of existence, the viscera of battle. Some of it is spectacular—Amleth scales a fort using only his ax, and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke captures Skarsgård doing it in one unbroken take.  Blaschke’s cinematography is one of the highlights of The Northman. The images are dripping with violence, but they are also arresting and hallucinatory at the same time—ditto for Louise Ford’s editing, which puts viewers in a headspace somewhere between prophecy and madness. Eggers and Sjón’s script is episodic, each section introduced by titles presented in runes. Accompanied by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s ominous music, these section headings provide a dramatic touch but also give the proceedings the rote feeling of a paradigm. That’s disappointing, particularly in the third act, when a revelation threatens to undermine Amleth’s vengeance but fails to derail it. If Eggers intends to show how revenge—life-long revenge—corrupts and corrodes and consumes everything that is good and holds hope, then the ending of The Northman falls back on the old heroic same old same old. Some might find glory in it. For the rest, it’ll just feel empty and familiar.  Due to severe weather this past week, Boulder Weekly is currently experiencing phone outages.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," On display once again are the filmmaker’s aesthetic instincts, his mastery of framing, and his ability to squeeze every ounce of brutal beauty from a scene. This film is gorgeous, simultaneously broadcasting the wonder and unconquerable ruggedness of its Nordic land and seascapes. There are also familiar faces. Anya-Taylor Joy plays Olga, a spoil of war too cunning to remain long in bonds. She’s joined in smaller roles by Eggers favorites Ralph Ineson, Kate Dickie, and Willem Dafoe as a wizened court jester. Now, if you’re not a fan of the director’s two previous features, 2015’s The Witch and 2019’s The Lighthouse, that does not necessarily predict your feelings about his latest effort. Eggers is working in a different genre with a different, far larger cast and scope this time around. What you have is a classic vengeance tale: prince witnesses royal betrayal and the murder of his father. He loses his mother and his crown and vows revenge. You’ve seen the trailer. Skarsgård is cut to play a Viking. His performance is primarily physical: blind rage looking for an outlet. He’s believably vicious, bloodthirsty, single-minded and, when necessary, vulnerable. The entire cast around him is equally convincing. Nicole Kidman – who played Skarsgård’s wife in the HBO series Big Little Lies, graduates to mother here, while Ethan Hawke plays his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven. Oh, plus Bjork because Iceland. In fact, Egger’s co-writer here, beloved Icelandic novelist and screenwriter Sjón, penned not only last year’s gorgeous folk horror The Lamb, but also Bjork’s early work with Lars von Trier, Dancer in the Dark. Classic is exactly how The Northman feels. The story is gritty and grand, the action brutal and the storytelling majestic. As is the case with Eggers, expect a fair amount of the supernatural and surreal to seep in here and there, but not enough to outweigh the meticulously crafted period realism."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"A monumentally bonkers, blood-smeared battering ram of Old World barbarism. "
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," A trip through director Robert Eggers’ filmography will be most useful for those experiencing his work for the first time. A word to the wise — marketing Eggers films to mainstream audiences is tricky, so his trailers are cut to sell you something you think you are familiar with. His debut “The Witch” was not a typical horror film; despite discovering Anya Taylor-Joy, it was divisive for fans of the genre. His second feature “The Lighthouse,” a black-and-white two hander with Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, was even more alienating for viewers. Having viewed his previous films will prepare for what “The Northman” ultimately is and what it is not. This is easily Eggers’ most accessible and mainstream film yet, combining elements from both previous films into a slightly more straightforward narrative. Too long, too dark; hard to follow; often abandons the plot. Dumb ending. (Some left early.) This movie is not one you would want to see twice.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," The greatest achievement possible for a historical drama is to truly immerse the audience in a time and place. Not just to re-create set dressing and dialect but to inform every moment with the culture, the world view, the feeling of that setting. By that measurement, Robert Eggersâ The Northman is an extraordinary feat of cinema â but itâs also a bloody, mournful, violent tale of vengeance that is never simply academic, but visceral, sensual, emotional, and epic. Itâs also not about Vikings. After all, that is a term that was applied by outsiders to the peoples of Northern Europe, a name that translates roughly to âpirate.â Instead, Eggers looks from within, and there is arguably no filmmaker better suited to the task. In both The Witch and The Lighthouse, he absorbed a vast amount of research on two particular locales and eras (the early Colonial American Eastern Seaboard and the isolation of 19th-century lighthouse keepers, respectively) and used it all to quietly color every moment. The Northman works on a vast canvas â or rather, map. The time is the decades around the turn of the 10th century, but there is not one place, rather a swath of Northern Europe from the Orkneys to the bleak and recently settled hinterlands of Iceland, to the farmlands of the Rus on the western steppe. Thereâs no monoculture here, but vying kingdoms, warbands, faiths, mythologies, and interests. If the story and the name resonate with familiarity, itâs because the story of Amleth is a Viking tale of unclear origins, later versions of which were the basis for Shakespeareâs Hamlet. Scripting alongside author and longtime BjÃ¶rk collaborator SigurjÃ³n Birgir SigurÃ°sson (writing here under the nom de plume SjÃ³n) to fulfill a longtime ambition of SkarsgÃ¥rd to recreate the era, Eggers weaves together the strands of mythology and history that are what we know. He conjures up the sensation of what it was to live in the cold mire of the firm belief that the Norns had your fate ordained, and that one of the slaves with whom Amleth hides himself (Eggers regular Taylor-Joy) can channel Slavic earth magic. Itâs a past place where shamans can speak to the dead and warriors can channel atavistic spirits. Magic is in the gut and the soil, as real as iron and wood and bone. Violence is a constant interrupter, even though Eggers more often shows the disturbing result than its execution. Itâs the perfect tone at which to pitch The Northman, because our understanding of exactly what the time of the Vikings (curse that word) was like is imprecise. The film is subjective, an onscreen exercise in reconstructive archaeology rich with the kind of subtext that flows deep in Eggersâ work (such as the struggle between the honor-driven Odin cultists and the fertility rites of Freyja). Yet itâs never dry, figuratively or literally. Amleth cuts a bloody path through the Norse realms, his gore-soaked hands keeping an ever-lessening grasp on the slippery concept of revenge. Like Hamlet, he is faced with choices as to whether to continue or not, but there is more than an enraged shade of his father forcing his inevitable steps toward a spectacular showdown on the ashen slopes of a volcano. The Northman lives and breathes like the old epics; not Old Hollywoodâs cartoonish depictions of warriors with horned helmets, but the ancient tales to which he pays deep respect.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers knows he'll never get to make another movie like ""The Northman"" again. In a recent, unexpectedly candid, New Yorker profile of the filmmaker, he spoke in depth about the behind the scenes struggles of making his Viking revenge epic, airing the kind of stories about the production's troubles that aren't typically voiced until many years later. It was notable for several reasons, not least because it seemed to be preparing the sizeable cult fanbase of his two prior films (2015's ""The Witch"" and 2019's ""The Lighthouse"") for a compromised studio product. At one point, he even remarked that the finished cut, re-edited after muted early test screenings, ""was the most entertaining version of the film"" — something he seemed to have mixed feelings about delivering. Naturally, this studio-approved cut of ""The Northman"" is Eggers' weakest directorial effort to date, a retelling of the Scandinavian legend which inspired Shakespeare to write ""Hamlet"" that triumphs in terms of pure cinematic spectacle, but feels ever so slightly insubstantial when viewed as anything more than a genre exercise. Eggers has previously said he explores our present by looking through the past; the paranoia of his folk horror debut reflected contemporary societal fears about women in power, while his darkly comic second feature used its queer undertones to explore male power dynamics. None of this richness in theme is present in his latest. It's brought to life once again with an unparalleled attention to historical detail, but as the central revenge plot proves too familiar even in the hands of this most distinctive of directors, I found myself only able to appreciate it in terms of its filmmaking craft. 
In a prologue, we're introduced to young Prince Amleth. The year is 895, and his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) has returned from battle, readying his son for a ceremony in which he will become a man — something that consists of howling like a wolf, burping, and farting. This flatulence is the clearest sign that, yes, you are watching the latest film from the director who got an entire film's worth of comic mileage out of Willem Dafoe breaking wind. Unfortunately, the levity ends here. Soon after Amleth experiences his rite of passage, his father is slain in front of him by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), with the kid fleeing the scene and setting sail to safer territory, vowing only to return one day to avenge his father and save his mother (Nicole Kidman) from the man who killed her husband.





We pick up several years later. Amleth has now grown into Alexander Skarsgård, and travels across Eastern Europe pillaging settlements. Eggers' desire for historical accuracy ensures this isn't a sanitized depiction of Vikings; he hasn't made anything that could be appropriated as heroic by white supremacists like some commentators have feared (Norse mythology remains beloved by the European far right), but he also doesn't delve into the complications of its character in the way you might hope either. The parallels between how he fled home and how he's now displacing others are visibly there, but don't impact the central character study in the way they should — a richer, more complicated revenge saga frustratingly within grasp, but ignored to follow the basic mechanics of a revenge narrative.





His lifelong quest gets back on track after a seeress (Björk, whose performance sadly amounts to a cameo) appears to tell him he finally has his chance to take on Fjölnir. He hides on a slave ship heading to Iceland, and finds himself in the village where his uncle, to whom he is now unrecognizable, resides — with his mother now happily married to him. With the help of fellow slave and sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) he aims to take down Fjölnir's men before killing his uncle and saving his mother from what seems like marital imprisonment. What could possibly go wrong?

It's unfortunate that ""The Northman"" succeeds only when it comes to realizing its nihilistic style, but make no mistake, Eggers' recreation of this grim period of history is utterly commendable. Working with his regular cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, each sequence is crafted like no other film on this scale; patient, single camera shots that slowly introduce us to each new setting or period in the story. The aforementioned New Yorker feature highlighted the all-star cast's bafflement on set to Eggers' favored way of shooting these bold sequences — why would he film a violent siege sequence from just one perspective (to name the most visually arresting example), rather than shoot for coverage if needed? But the boldness pays off, allowing you more time to soak up every minor detail of the elaborate production and costume design onscreen, submerging you in the era to the extent you can practically smell the mud and burning houses.





Nothing else in the film makes as visceral an impact, a disappointment coming from a filmmaker whose prior two films got uncomfortably under the audience's skin in different ways. This might be the fault of adapting a story whose bare bones inspired everything from Shakespeare to ""The Lion King,"" with very few moments generating the prickly discomfort that characterized his prior features due to narrative familiarity (it almost made me relieved his ""Nosferatu"" adaptation has been canceled). A notable exception to this is Nicole Kidman's performance; although in many ways the driving force for Amleth's vengeance, she largely remains a background presence until the second half, when one monologue slowly blossoms into the most disturbing sequence the actor has starred in onscreen since the bathtub scene in 2004's ""Birth.""





It's the only genuinely unexpected moment in a straightforward tale of revenge, designed to split audiences down the middle between fits of uncomfortable laughter and genuine queasiness. It's also the moment Eggers finally begins to explore the complications that come with chasing vengeance on your own personal terms, a rich theme that almost immediately falls to the wayside as we arrive at the expected third act bloodbath.
Eggers' films have long had style, but ""The Northman"" is the first time he's ever prioritized it over substance. The film features some of the grandest cinematic spectacle you're likely to see at the movies this year, but despite coming from a singular directorial voice, the story around it doesn't reinvent the revenge epic so much as it laboriously conforms to its conventions.

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," “The Northman,” an ambitious deep dive into 10th-century Viking myth by Robert Eggers, is many movies at once: Bold and beautiful, bloody and completely bonkers, it marks a visionary and visceral high point in the post-“Game of Thrones” action-fantasy sweepstakes, whose main metric of success seems to be packing in as many beheadings, blood feuds and examples of medieval arcana as possible into ’twas-ever-thus commentaries on man’s inhumanity to man. All those boxes are dutifully checked in “The Northman,” with alternately impressive and inane results. Alexander Skarsgard, who conceived the film with Eggers, plays Amleth, who was heir to the kingdom of his father, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), until his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) arrived on the scene. After witnessing his father’s brutal murder, the dispossessed prince adopts a mantra he will repeat throughout “The Northman”: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” A little on the nose, but okay. For the next two-plus hours, “The Northman” chronicles Amleth’s quest, which takes him from the north Atlantic to the Slavic Land of Rus to Iceland. Viewers who have noted the narrative scaffolding for Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” will have a vague notion of how it all turns out. But there are still surprises in a film that pulls from a wide range of sources, including good old Sophocles. The mother Amleth seeks to rescue, a Botticelli-haired queen named Gudrun, is played by Nicole Kidman in a slyly subversive turn. She owns one of “The Northman’s” most arresting reversals, in a scene that proves yet again why she might be the most adventurous actress of her generation. (Even amid a jumble of accents that sound like they came from all the houses of Gucci, the performances in “The Northman” are uniformly excellent, especially when it comes to Bang’s interloper and his own entitled eldest son, played by Gustav Lindh with nastily convincing menace.) Fans of Eggers, who made a hugely promising debut in 2015 with “The Witch,” followed up by the bizarre two-hander “The Lighthouse” in 2019, know the director is something of a fetishist: He’s fascinated by ritual, runic mysticism and physical mortification, as well as visual compositions that favor firelight, shadows and bravura camera work. The director has called “The Northman” a cross between “Andrei Rublev” and “Conan the Barbarian,” and that high-low aesthetic is very much in play. Eggers channels the great Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky in scenes of astonishing historical detail, patient observation and hallucinatory strangeness. Early in the film, Amleth and his father — played with breathtaking ferocity by Hawke — take part in an initiation ritual that involves them crawling on all fours and howling like dogs; the visions escalate throughout a film that at one point features the Icelandic singer Bjork as a “seeress” draped in cowrie shells, feathers and wheat stalks. As arresting and elaborate as the images are in “The Northman,” there are just as many sequences that revert strictly to pulpy, B-movie type. As an heir to such recent films as “The Green Knight” and “The Last Duel” — not to mention Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Valhalla Rising” — “The Northman” lavishly rewards fans of the swords-and-vandals genre, even if it leaves the rest of us in bludgeoned, bemused awe. Whether in the form of tribal battles, man-to-man combat or even a brief game of primitive rugby, the grunting, bellowing and bestial impaling never cease in a world of birthright, honor and aggression that seems to have sprung from the imaginings of Robert Bly at his most febrile. I promised myself I wouldn’t use the term “toxic masculinity” in this review (oops), but that concept forms an unmistakable ostinato in “The Northman,” which Eggers co-wrote with the Icelandic novelist and poet Sjon. Not only does Gudrun exemplify a particularly edgy brand of feminine strength and agency, but Amleth eventually becomes ambivalent about what he calls “the freezing river of hate that runs in my veins,” mostly with the help of a sylphlike slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). “Your strength breaks men’s bones,” Olga tells him. “I have the cunning to break their minds.” That feminist nod is but a punctuation point in a story that bemoans the suffering caused by atavistic patterns of aggrieved and insecure men seeking to prove their worth by fighting, raping and taking. It’s impossible to watch “The Northman” and not think of Ukraine, where yet another variation on a timeless theme plays out in a modern-day Land of Rus with sadistic futility. Still, as much as Eggers might think he’s critiquing that cruelty and self-serving superstition, he indulges in their vicarious thrills with far more enthusiasm and voyeuristic extravagance. Blood, gore, honor and revenge will always be the hoariest staples of cinematic grammar, no matter how cleverly they’re undercut. Ultimately, “The Northman” isn’t just about fatalism at its most epic and overwrought, it suffers from it, too. ’Twas ever thus, indeed."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," “The Northman,” which wanders narratively but, as cinema, basically eats “Conan” for breakfast, follows what might be considered a similar career path: Prince, followed by Slave, then Viking Marauder, and finally Newly Sensitized Lover and Potential Family Man. Alexander Skarsgard takes the title role, as well as taking a fair bit of on-screen punishment en route to a climactic battle at the Gates of Hel (one “l” in this hell, for the record). There, at Hel, Amleth, played by Skarsgard, wields his mighty sword against his kingdom-usurping uncle (Claes Bang) surrounded by rivers of flaming molten lava. They’re nude, discreetly silhouetted, and as in much of “The Northman” the scene’s melding of digital and practical effects and design strategies doesn’t lead to the usual fantasy generica. Robert Eggers creates worlds that used to be, or never were, but thanks to his chosen medium, there they are, vivid and alive. Warning: The movie is not for stubbornly mainstream tastes or the eccentricity-resistant. This is director Eggers’ third feature, following his exquisite debut “The Witch” (2016), set in the 1630s, and the late 19th-century odd-couple nightmare “The Lighthouse” (2019). Shot in Ireland and Iceland on a large budget, “The Northman” put Eggers through a new set of paces, involving test screenings and studio input and the pressure to deliver. I can’t speak to its commercial prospects, which is a euphemism for “leave that to Variety.” Eggers and his co-screenwriter, the Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, have made a movie that reminds you of many other movies, from “The Vikings” to “Spartacus,” and myths, and even plays: Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” comes from the same medieval Scandinavian legends as “The Northman” does. Young prince Amleth, played in the early going by Oscar Novak, has a bright future. His father-king (Ethan Hawke) has returned from the sea, and while his mother-queen (Nicole Kidman) may be dogged by the occasional rumor of messing around with the king’s brother (Claes Bang), all seems well for a bit. Then the bit passes; the usurping uncle kills his brother, kidnaps the queen and the boy, outwitting his would-be assassins, escapes and is presumed dead. “The Northman” jumps ahead a generation and picks up with Amleth, enslaved and then, in short order, a Viking marauder with “a heart of cold iron.” He remembers who he used to be, but only because he is driven by dreams of avenging his father’s death. From there the film, which is outlandishly gory in some unexpected ways, becomes a romance tinged with mysticism, in between calmly composed shots of entrails leaving a soldier’s stomach. Anya Taylor-Joy, who starred in “The Witch,” returns here as the Slavic slave woman who becomes Amleth’s partner in scheming, long-term planning and true love. This leads to a reckoning for the brutish hero. Amleth is told by the “Seeress,” played by Björk with don’t-doubt-me intensity, that Amleth must keep his eye on his destiny, take care of business with his uncle and rescue his mother. The Seeress sees more than she’s telling, as it turns out, and from there “The Northman” combines plotting that rewrites “Hamlet” with more familiar Viking genre satisfactions and leaps into the supernatural. The reason I like “The Northman” more than any number of other big-budget period bloodbaths, from “Conan the Barbarian” to “Braveheart,” lies in Eggers’ sly juggling of an audience’s rooting interests. Temperamentally, Eggers really isn’t into rooting interests as a story driver. The downside of that can be detected in Skarsgard’s fierce but narrow performance, which is limited by the conception of the character as a pure revenge machine, complicated, later, by his humane awakening. But the movie’s baked-in macho violence feels different here — a little more skeptical, with fewer triumphal “kills” than usual. It’s a hearty stew of influences and rewards and, yes, some gristle. Once too often, probably, Eggers bores in on Amleth in glowering, half-crazed Kubrickian close-up. But he’s a director who knows how, and when, to move a camera, and how long a shot should be sustained, and where our perspective should be in relation to a harsh act or fleeting glimpse of violence. “The Northman” fills out its widescreen canvas, carefully and meticulously. Yes, a different co-writer might’ve helped Eggers create a more propulsive new-style epic, instead of the trancelike vision of the 10th and early 11th centuries we have here. But these days, does anyone really want a Viking fantasy of power, revenge, spilled blood and hot lava that’s all fake realism and no genuine magic?

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," There are disbowelments, beheadings and more stabby-stabs than you can count. If you’re squeamish, The Northman is going to send you into a spin, and you’re definitely going to stop wolfing down that bucket of popcorn. Food and The Northman don’t mix. Starring Alexander Skarsgard, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman and Claes Bang, The Northman is an epic Viking tale of vengeance and fate. And you can’t exact revenge without spilling a lot of blood.  The Northman is an extravagant and unshackled cinematic experience with a vibe akin to a rock opera performed at the foot of an active volcano – and yes, there is a scene set at the foot of an active volcano and it is insane in the best way. The Northman is heightened in every way, but it is also unequivocally engaging so that your attention never wavers. Even when you instinctively look away, – because, you know, the violence – your eyes will dart back immediately. You wouldn’t want to miss a moment. The story and characters are based on a Viking legend that provided the basis for William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, so that should give you an idea about the scale of what’s at stake – all those grand human experiences between life and death such as honour and shame, love and hate, and betrayal and revenge. Amleth (Skarsgard) was a child prince when he witnessed his father King Aurvandill (Hawke) murdered by his uncle Fjolnir (Bang), barely escaping and pledging to avenge his dad’s death and rescue his mother Gudrun (Kidman). Raised to kill, pillage and plunder by a group of Vikings, the adult Amleth has an unquenchable bloodthirst, one which he directs at his uncle when he spots an opportunity to infiltrate Fjolnir’s chiefdom.  Disguised as a slave, Amleth plots his revenge, aided by Olga (Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave with sorcery powers, and with the push of a seer (Bjork) and a he-witch (Ingvar Sigurdsson) who talk of prophecies and fate. Filmmaker Robert Eggers made his splashy debut in 2015 with The Witch, which launched his and Taylor-Joy’s careers. His follow-up The Lighthouse was a disturbing black-and-white two-hander with Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe that easily crossed the line into grotesquerie. With The Northman, Eggers hasn’t dulled his instincts to challenge, but it is less scrappy than his previous works – perhaps that’s due to the epic scale of the story, which required a more even-keeled tone. There’s no question though, that Eggers is in command of his primal and raw vision. The near-monochromatic visuals, punctuated at times with vivid reds (fire and blood) and greens (the Icelandic landscape), often captured in confronting close-ups or elaborately staged long takes, are extraordinary to watch on a large screen. Both a great sports movie and unconventionally riveting romantic drama, Challengers volleys the audience back and forth to reveal what is riding on a tennis match, writes Leigh Paatsch."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Tell you what, that Robert Eggers is a bloody interesting director. He popped onto the scene in 2015 with The Witch, a folk horror shot in natural light which featured an evil goat and actress Anya Taylor-Joy’s striking debut. The Lighthouse followed in 2019, a heavily symbolic yarn shot in black and white that basically had Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe getting rinsed and going berko in the 1.19:1 aspect ratio. Well, now the talented 38-year-old director’s much anticipated third film is here, The Northman, and the result is a Viking epic unlike any you’ve seen before. The Northman tells the tale of Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgård), a young Viking prince whose life is turned upside down by a series of events best described as very ‘first act of John Milius’ Conan the Barbarian-y’. His father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) is murdered and his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) kidnapped. Amleth barely escapes with his life and is forced to flee his home, vowing revenge as he briskly buggers off. Decades later, adult Amleth is a vicious Viking berserker, looting and pillaging with nihilistic abandon, when a Seeress (Björk) puts him back on the path of retribution. And so unfolds a bloody tale of brutal vengeance, anchored by a stirring performance from Skarsgård. It’s also a stunning showcase of Eggers’ versatility, because a movie about two blokes sitting in a room and talking this ain’t! The action scenes, of which there are many, are vicious bloody affairs, dripping with mud and menace, offering a stark and unflinching look at Viking combat. Conversely, the more esoteric and spiritual scenes, of which there are many, have an odd sense of veracity, making them feel a part of the same grimdark world rather than indulgent flourishes. See, Vikings believed the supernatural existed cheek by jowl with the mundane, and this epic yarn reflects that artfully. Performances are uniformly great, with solid work from Ethan Hawke and Anya Taylor-Joy, not to mention a frequently uncomfortable (but icily effective) Nicole Kidman. However, this is very much Skarsgård’s show, and the 45-year-old is an absolute beast here. Rippling with muscular rage and bloody intent, this feels like the role the Swedish actor was born to play and he embraces the character with a full-bodied snarl. He’s electric and compelling and utterly unforgettable. The Northman is a deft blend of arthouse flick and historical drama, dripping with atmosphere and anchored by strong performances and superb direction. Its violent 137 minute journey rarely slows down and is never less than gripping and has set a new high bar for future tales of this type. For open-minded cinemagoers who can handle the brutality, The Northman is a veritable Valhalla."

"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Believe it or not, Will Ferrell and Robert Eggers have a lot in common when it comes to their cinematic output. The comic actor has made a career on the big screen satirizing macho doofuses in films like ANCHORMAN, BLADES OF GLORY, and TALLADEGA NIGHTS. Eggers likes to rip machismo too, albeit more seriously. In THE WITCH, the writer/director showcased a pigheaded patriarch whose arrogance gets almost everyone in his family killed. In THE LIGHTHOUSE, Eggers presented a story of two men whose stoicism drives them to madness. And in THE NORTHMAN which opens Friday, Eggers tells a tale of a violent Norse Viking whose quest for vengeance destroys his world. It’s a brutal takedown of male testosterone, one that sometimes comes off as over-the-top silly as Ferrell’s films. One expects a period piece about early Norsemen to be packed with bloodletting, but Eggers seems hellbent on outdoing the maiming and mayhem exhibited in similarly over-the-top violent films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN or BRAVEHEART. The world he creates here is filled with men so feral they bark at each other like dogs, rape and plunder with utter abandon, and even turn an afternoon game of sport into an opportunity to kill each other. The hellzapoppin’ machismo reaches a saturation point and then starts to edge towards the ridiculous.Ethan Hawke plays King Aurvandil, returning to his village after a year-long excursion, where he soon lords over his people the beauty of his wife Gudrun (Nicole Kidman), and the maturation of his son Amleth (Oscar Novak). Such boasting doesn’t sit well with his jealous brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) and it isn’t long before he slays the monarch. Amleth witnesses the horrific murder by beheading but manages to escape by doing some slicing and dicing himself. He manages to cut off the nose of one of Fjolnir’s henchmen, proving his father right. The boy has matured, indeed, into one handy swordsman.  Years go by and Amleth becomes a man. A beefy and buff Alexander Skarsgard plays the returning son, hellbent on revenge and a stranger to those he left behind in the kingdom. Here Eggers makes matters much more interesting by throwing some choice obstacles in the way of Amleth’s revenge plotting. For starters, he’s captured by his uncle’s minions and forced into slavery. And secondly, Fjolnir is far from the mighty king he once was. The incompetent fool has lost his castle and kingdom and is now stuck heading up merely a small village of devout followers.Had Eggers stayed wholly on this path, playing up the emptiness of Amleth’s mission and the foolhardiness of violent men, the film might have been a searing indictment of the patriarchy. But alas, Eggers wants to eat his cake and have it too. He spends as much time reveling in the violence as he does in condemning it. Eggers devotes oodles of screen time showing men pummeling other men, butchering animals, and abusing women. After 90 minutes, the story becomes too unseemly.Other issues hurt the film too. The actors’ attempts at authentic accents tend to veer all over the map and some of the action scenes feel amateurishly choreographed. You can see numerous punches being pulled here and there. Additionally, many lines of dialogue are as over-the-top corny as anything uttered by Kirk Douglas in THE VIKINGS in 1958. Skarsgard makes a more believable brute than Douglas did back then, but the Swedish-born actor struggles to give his lead dimension. That’s surprising, considering how memorable he essayed the baddies he played on HBO’s TRUE BLOOD and BIG LITTLE LIES this past decade. On the plus side, Nicole Kidman gives a surprisingly menacing performance as a queen who’s not quite the victim she pretends to be, and Eggers certainly knows how to world-build. The production design, costuming, makeup, and cinematography are all first-rate, and the locations are damp with fog and danger. Eggers’ superb use of landscapes covers the gamut too, from rugged cliffs to treacherous waters to fiery volcanos. The film wants to be a bare-chested HAMLET, a searing tale of a monarch’s son vengefully littering the kingdom with bodies throughout his quest. It achieves that in some respects, even presenting its own version of Ophelia in Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga. She plays a savvy slave here, exploited by the men around her but holding onto her bearings through it all, unlike Shakespeare’s tragic ingenué. Taylor-Joy doesn’t have many lines or storytime, but she holds the screen like a true movie star. More of Olga’s strong character and less of the bellicose brutality of the male ones would’ve helped Eggers in his well-meaning critique of toxic masculinity. Instead, his savaging of machismo is dampened by all the savagery he insists on splattering across the screen. The violence is so overdone that it’s almost laughable. But not in a good Will Ferrell comedy kind of way."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," There have been many movies and television shows made around Vikings. Robert Eggers the director of the Lighthouse has joined the Viking crusade with his latest film in The Northman. Unlike his previous films The Northman is action packed and that’s a good thing. The story line is straightforward but entertaining.   The plot is loosely based on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Young Amelth witnesses the betrayal of his father, King Auryandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), by his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang), and pledges vengeance on those involved. Young Amelth matures into a strong fighting machine, as successfully depicted by Alexander Skarsgard. He devotes his life to become a full-fledged assassin. As he embarks on this journey he encounters a witch (Bjork) who sees his identity and reminds him of his mission.  After learning of his betrayer's new location, Amelth disguises himself as a slave, joins a ship, and sails to Iceland. He discovers in Iceland that his mother (Nicole Kidman) survived the siege. After losing the realm to King Harold, she is now living the life of a farmer. During the arduous journey to Iceland, he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Ana Taylor-Joy). She is a fellow slave and a witch. In her he has a partner to help exact his vengeance.  Eggers' earlier films were designed for an audience that enjoys art house films, but with The Northman, he has a $70 million dollar budget, bigger stars, and a chance to acquire a wider audience. Presents are still the creative cinematography and eerie music that he enjoys using. The growing vengeance motif allows for plenty of action and violence. You won't be disappointed if you like axes being thrown. The aggression is concentrated and does not linger. There are also great special effects in the scenes involving Odin the Norse God and all the spirituality surrounding that giving the film an extra sense of drama. The open scenery as Amelth is traveling across the ocean and highlands is also enthralling. The only drawback is that the tale appears to be a little plodding at points. The audience realizes that Amelth is on a quest, but it takes a bit for the rest of the cast to emerge. There's also the matter of Kidman playing Skarsgard's mother. She's only nine years older than him, yet this is the most exciting character she's played in a long time. Ana Taylor-Joy is delightful as Olga. She has spunk and agency. She’s not just there to be the pretty girl.  As Amelth, Skarsgard is outstanding. He's a man who hasn't had many chances to play the hero. It was nice to root for his character  in this very dark but entertaining tale. Another advantage of the film is that it is only two hours and 18 minutes long.  The Northman's other strength is that it manages to keep your attention from beginning to conclusion. This is thanks to Eggers strong direction and Jarin Blaschke strong cinematography. We are immersed in Amelth's adventure due to Skarsgard's performance and action, which is riveting from start to finish. Rarely does a picture have decent action with great acting, making The Northman a win-win situation for everyone."
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," Forget Hamlet. Times such as these call for a hero more assertive than a melancholy Dane. Thus, writer-director Robert Eggers has reached further back into literary history to find Amleth, the old prince of Germanic and Norse myth who inspired Shakespeare’s most famous and enduring play. Eggers’s new film, The Northman (in theaters April 22), trades the courtly, clever intrigue of Shakespeare’s day for the blood and mud and fire of Amleth’s Viking age. This is a natural step for Eggers. His past two films, 2015’s Puritan horror tale The Witch and 2019’s cabin fever two-hander The Lighthouse, are also about the brutality of yesteryear. These eras are often cozily or nobly mythologized; Eggers takes pains to tell us that they were reliably awful. There has never been so rosy a view of first-millenium Ireland and Iceland, but the hit show Vikings has, in recent years, at least put all that clang and conquest in grand historical context. The Northman, in contrast, keeps things squalid and faintly silly, even when it whips up a magnificent holy fervor. The film is a simple story of revenge. Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) seeks to destroy his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who has killed Amleth’s father (Ethan Hawke) and taken Amleth’s mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), for his wife. To do that, Amleth must make himself scarce for a number of years, raiding Rus’ settlements throughout Northern Europe with a band of reavers, waiting for time and fate to reveal his opportunity to strike. When that moment does arrive, Amleth voluntarily enslaves himself and gets shipped off to barren, dreaded Iceland, where Fjölnir rules over a petty little fiefdom, chased out of the land he violently overtook decades prior. Just as in Hamlet, the supernatural comes to bear on The Northman. Björk plays a mystical seeress whose prophecy does actually seem pretty well informed. (Which is to say, Björk plays herself.) Amleth has visions of Valkyries and of the blinding light of Valhalla, suggesting that there are divine hands guiding his mission of retribution. Or maybe he’s just a little nuts, seeing patterns and signs everywhere he goes because he is so consumed by his ultimately meaningless quest. Eggers is coy about the film’s deeper intention, whether all of Amleth’s struggle is meant to be appreciated on its literal terms or if it is offered as wry commentary on the bullshit men use to cloak their pride and vanity in righteousness. Maybe it’s both. There is usually a glint of humor in Eggers’s work (he co-wrote this film with Sjón), a wink that hints at a sneaky function buried in a looming form. I suspect that’s what’s happening amid The Northman’s howling turgidity; there’s a chuckle chasing after Fjölnir as he stomps around his sorry little settlement and Amleth realizes the fault in his valorizing idea of his parents. What are we doing all this for, the film faintly asks, when so much of it could be solved if everyone just sat down to talk rather than entering every room sword first? On its more tangible merits, the film is a formidable achievement. Jarin Blaschke’s enveloping cinematography is complemented by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s score, a primal rumble that is the scariest thing in the movie. Eggers’s action sequences are swift and brutal, filled with the crunch of life extinguished and tossed into the bone pile of time. Skarsgård, hulking and seething, is a fine vessel for the film’s opulent menace. He’s a fearsome, yet elegant, creature of destruction as he hacks and slashes away. In the film’s quieter scenes, when Amleth is making common cause (and eventually romance) with an enslaved woman from Rus named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), we see glimmers of his mopish Danish descendant. Amleth is, at root, merely a pained and jilted son who only wants things settled—or, really, set back to how they were—so that the restlessness within him, the storm of his angst and conflicted duty, may finally go quiet. Skarsgård compellingly renders that mettle and that weariness; he makes us viscerally feel the exhausting journey of the film. Part of that odyssey involves a game of something close to rugby, when Amleth and some other brutes get to brawling over a ball for the amusement of Fjölnir and his cohort. So, hey, there’s something not so ancient at all: a bloodsport passively enjoyed by rich folks on the sidelines. Men have been up to the same stuff for centuries, haven’t they? As Eggers considers that continuity, he shakes his head in resignation—with fascination, too. And he extends a little empathy in the end. The Northman generously gives these men the mythic deliverance they so feel they are owed, a mighty, volcanic climax in which they successfully rage against the sneaking truth that pursues them. There, as the earth opens up to consume them (or, maybe, cheer them on), this futile family feud at long last seems anything but small. — The “Hot Mess” Duchess at the Center of a ’60s Sex Scandal— Justice for Girls: Looking Back on the Show 10 Years Later— The Johnny Depp–Amber Heard Trial: How Did It Come to This?— Amanda Seyfried Wants to Reprise Her Role as Elizabeth Holmes— How the Cast of This Is Us Won Equal Pay— Will Smith Banned From the Oscars for 10 Years After the Slap— Netflix’s The Ultimatum Offers a Sadistic Twist on Reality Romance— From the Archive: How David Zaslav Became America’s King of Content— Sign up for the “HWD Daily” newsletter for must-read industry and awards coverage—plus a special weekly edition of “Awards Insider.”"
"Apr 21, 2022",POSITIVE," From visionary director Robert Eggers comes The Northman, an action-filled epic that follows a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father’s murder. While the subject matter veers away from the horrific elements that have been front and center in his first two features, there’s no question that “The Northman” is a Robert Eggers’ movie. Dark in tone and look, this re-do of “Hamlet” through the prism of Norse mythology is a technically adept, well-acted film that comes off as an art house version of “Conan the Barbarian.”  This is good, as far as it goes, which is enough to get us through the 135-minute running time.  However, it’s a cold exercise, lacking the sort of emotional engagement necessary to move us, as Eggers opts for a more visceral approach instead. Set in the late 9th century, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) has returned home from a long campaign and is warmly greeted by his wife, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) and son, Amleth (Oscar Novak). It is a seemingly joyous occasion, the highlight being a rite of passage for the boy facilitated by Heimir the Fool (Willem Defoe) and some powerful hallucinogens. During this, Amleth is shown his future, one he fails to fully comprehend but fate takes a hand when he later witnesses his uncle Fjolinir (Claes Bang), who eschews the poison-in-the-ear approach, brutally kill Aurvandil. Fleeing in terror, Amleth sets out on a stormy sea until he comes to the Land of the Rus where he grows strong and falls in with a group of pillagers who murder and rape the citizens of any village they find. After one such attack, he encounters a witch (Bjork) who reminds him of the prophecy he was once told, it suddenly becoming clear that he needs to return to the kingdom of his birth to avenge his father’s death. Pretending to be a slave, he returns and is promptly sold to his uncle, along with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) who has her own agenda. The film is a visual knockout, cinematographer Jarin Blaschke capturing varying gradations of gray to create a perpetually overcast world, one barely keeping complete darkness at bay.  Only a very few scenes contain a suggestion of sunlight – muted at that – as little hope is present in this violent, primitive place. This is a violent world, one in which Darwinism rules, the strong and ruthless rising to the top, giving no quarter to the weak or stupid. To be sure, the film earns its R rating, the action scenes brilliantly staged and captured – Eggers pulls off an unbroken tracking shot during an attack that’s a thing of beauty – blood and guts spilled freely and often.  Still, it never feels gratuitous, every death contributing to the nihilistic mood, underscoring the danger Amleth must contend with while on his unshakeable path. Still and all, there’s something missing here. While we may understand everyone’s intention, there’s no emotional connection with any of them. Something of a romance develops between Amleth and Olga, yet it comes off as something Eggers felt obliged, rather than compelled, to include. The movie threatens to suck us in emotionally when Kidman and Alexander Skarsgard, as the adult Amleth, confront one another, the tone of the film shifting noticeably as these two screen veterans reveal what’s in their characters’ hearts. Unfortunately, it’s a fleeting moment. Don’t get me wrong, “The Northman” is a well-made adventure that’s well-acted, artfully rendered and never less than interesting. And while its oft-covered theme that vengeance leads to the destruction of those who pursue it is driven home with uncommon force, the narrative comes off much as its hero destiny – a lockstep formula that cannot be altered or bothered to move its audience."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Anyone who has seen The Witch or The Lighthouse knows that writer/director Robert Eggers is operating on a unique wavelength. His debut was a powerful tale of repression dressed in a folk-horror cloak. Audiences were mixed, likely due to its non-adherence to the beats of a mainstream horror flick (people in the audience at my inaugural viewing laughed at the film, those heathens). His follow up, which I would say was even better than his near-perfect debut, was less divisive, partially because audiences were more savvy to Eggers’ game, and partially because no one can resist a good on-screen fart, of which The Lighthouse has plenty. His latest film, The Northman, is easily his most accessible, but it would be a mistake to think that his junior outing would eschew the weirdness for which he has become known. The Northman is weird as hell, in the best of ways, and if you can’t abide the weirdness, please rest assured that at least one hearty fart is emitted within the first few minutes — and is emitted in front of Willem Dafoe, as is appropriate. This revenge tale borrows more than a little from Hamlet* (or, for the less Shakespearean among us, The Lion King). If the “king killed by brother, prince banished from the land, prince returns much later for revenge” plot wasn’t a dead giveaway, the lead character’s name, Amleth, sure as hell is. After an adolescence spent living among a pack of warriors who enjoy acting like wolves and kicking the asses of anyone they come across, the now grown Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) gets word of a ruler who sounds a lot like his murderous uncle. This ruler is seeking new slaves, so Amleth leaves his pack and stows away amidst the new recruits in order to get closer to his target. Before this, Amleth definitely catches a spear with his bare hands and then throws it back at its original hurler, killing him. It’s far from the most badass thing he does by the end of the film, but that’s the level of badassery we’re dealing with here. I wish I brought a pillow to the theater so I could indulge my desire to emit a primal scream every five minutes or so. I do not envy the jerk who attacks someone fresh out of a screening of The Northman — said jerk is likely to be beaten half to death and skinned the rest of the way. If I wanted to fight someone after watching 300, I wanted to fight fifty someones after watching The Northman. This is Amleth’s mantra, which he repeats as both a reminder of his mission, and to stoke the coals of his vengeful heart. For the record, Father is Ethan Hawke, Mother is Nicole Kidman, and Fjolnir is Claes Bang. All three do incredible work existing realistically in a truly bleak, terrifying world. Also along for the ride is the always compelling Anya Taylor-Joy, as Olga, a fellow slave and eventual love interest for Amleth. A mix of supernatural and real-world plotting color Amleth’s journey, but this is no Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings level of fantasy. Everyone in this world bleeds red and dies hard if called upon to do so. No one can shoot energy beams, and dragons do not come into the mix. There are no wizards, just earthy psychedelics. There is a sword which can only be used at night, for reasons that can only be ascribed to magic, but this limitation isn’t employed in a magicky way. Really it exists just so that some of the action can occur at night (which cinematographer Jarin Blaschke captures beautifully), and to give it the incredibly badass name of Nightblade. There is very little subtlety here. Swords have names, blood sprays at per-gallon rates, and much of the dialogue is screamed at the top of a performer’s lungs, typically from behind 36-pack abs while wearing the hollowed out corpse of a wolf. After the plot is set into motion and the stakes are set, we witness what is essentially a reverse slasher: an unstoppable killer dishing out gruesome and righteous violence under cover of night, leaving horrifying tableaus behind for survivors to find. But where this differs from a slasher is that the line between good and bad blurs as we learn more about Amleth and the history of his family. The introduction of gray areas into a revenge movie can sometime comes with a heavy dramatic price. The primal need to see comeuppance dished out at the end of a warhammer is exchanged for thematic depth. The trade off is considered worthwhile as much as not, but here it doesn’t feel like a trade at all. Eggers keeps everything at a steady boil, escalating it to a violent roil as needed. It’s breathlessly paced yet patiently considered. It’s thematically rich, but also a hell of a post-The Raid/John Wick action picture. It’s Hamlet and The Lion King, but ultimately it’s not. This adjacency exists only to be subverted, and also there is a nude sword fight on the lip of an active volcano. The Northman is another killer entry in the filmography of a storyteller who cannot be contained, and who seems unable to make a movie that couldn’t be described as “wild.” *I am fully aware that Hamlet is based on a classic story archetype, but I know little about it and really wanted to mention The Lion King, so you’ll just have to deal."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Not long into Robert Eggers’ “The Northman,” a mad and mesmerizing song of Iceland and fire, the camera plunges down into darkness, as if it had suddenly been swallowed up by the Earth. It’s AD 895, on a frigid North Atlantic island, and we’re following a scrawny young Viking prince, Amleth (Oscar Novak), and his scraggly bearded father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), as they descend into a firelit temple, where the royal stripling is led through a muddy, bloody rite of manhood. Amid much growling, howling, floating and farting, Aurvandil predicts his own impending demise and makes Amleth vow to avenge him — an oath sealed in blood and destined to be fulfilled with great geysers of gore and lava. There are many such grim prophecies and elemental eruptions in “The Northman,” starting with the movie’s arresting opening shot of a volcano belching smoke, fire and voice-over. (I didn’t catch every word, but the volcano might as well be saying, “Behold. Cinema.”) Aurvandil’s fatalistic vision will soon be proved correct:  After returning home from distant battlefields, the king is brutally slain by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang, “The Square”). Amleth, having witnessed his uncle’s betrayal, barely escapes alive but vows to return and avenge his father, as promised, and save his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), whom Fjölnir has taken as his wife. And return he will decades later, now played by a strapping, towering Alexander Skarsgård in full-blown Old Norse berserker mode, who tears into this role like a man — and an actor — seizing hold of his destiny. The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials. If you sense some mimicry in this madness, well spotted: The legend of Prince Amleth was the direct inspiration for “Hamlet,” though Skarsgård’s mighty warrior also hails from a cinematic pantheon of vengeance seekers broad enough to include Conan the Barbarian, Maximus and Inigo Montoya. If that makes “The Northman” sound derivative, it is: a witchy brew of Old Norse mythology, Hollywood pageantry and proto-Shakespearean revenge epic.  But Skarsgård (also one of the movie’s producers) has found an ideal collaborator in Eggers, a director sufficiently steeped in film history to know the difference between inspiration and imitation. Like his memorable period freakouts “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” though on a vastly more ambitious scale, “The Northman” is both a dazzling display of film craft and a sly retooling of genre, a movie that delights in fulfilling certain conventions while turning others on their artfully severed heads. And so while it’s clear enough how Amleth’s story will end, the long arc of his journey takes unpredictable, even unsettling turns. When we first meet Skarsgård’s fully grown Amleth, he’s joined a band of murderous marauders, clad in wolf skins as they bring a Slavic village to its knees. Eggers, shooting nearly every scene in fluid, intricately choreographed long takes, gives the action the deliberation and intensity of an ancient ritual. (The sweepingly immersive cinematography is by Jarin Blaschke, the spare, purposeful editing by Louise Ford.) This violence is the way of the world, the movie suggests, and the atrocities we’re witnessing — a burning hut evokes the wartime conflagrations of Elem Klimov’s “Come and See” — are as unexceptional as they are unbearable. Amleth, courting and thwarting our sympathies at will, is a very strong link in an endless chain of death. (He’s not alone, to judge by an end-credits crawl loaded with names like “Hrólfur Split-Lip” and “Thórfinnr Tooth-Gnasher.”) As Amleth goes on his latest feral rampage, you can’t help but wonder about how many children he’s orphaning and how many spinoff revenge dramas he’s setting in motion.  And Skarsgård, a charmer with an undercurrent of aloofness, is perfectly cast as a warrior so numb to carnage that it takes a supernatural intervention to remind him of his sworn mission: Fjölnir, Amleth learns, has been dethroned and  fled with Gudrún and his sons to Iceland. It’s only fitting that this news is delivered by a witchy seeress played by Iceland’s biggest star, Björk, resplendent in oracular blue lighting and a Cher-worthy seashell-ringed headdress. Björk is one of two prominent Icelandic talents pressed into service here. The other is  poet and novelist Sjón, who co-wrote the screenplay with Eggers (and who supplied lyrics for Björk’s last major movie, 2000’s “Dancer in the Dark”). Their involvement speaks to Eggers’ characteristic insistence on verisimilitude, born of an obsessive, research-driven approach to filmmaking that might seem persnickety if it weren’t so passionate. A production and costume designer before he turned to directing, Eggers has become our great builder of worlds in extremis: After the spooky Puritan New England of “The Witch” and the lonely maritime outpost of “The Lighthouse,” he once again conjures a nightmarish vision of humanity on the precipice. But despite the fastidiousness of “The Northman’s” animal-pelts-and-chain-mail aesthetic, the filmmaking feels freer, looser and nuttier this time around — and not just because the spotty visual record of ancient Viking culture leaves plenty to an artist’s imagination. (The director’s splendid regular collaborators include  production designer Craig Lathrop and  costume designer Linda Muir.) Happily, Eggers makes movies, not research papers, and his sweet spot is that zone where his art-film idiosyncrasies merge with a genuine flair for Hollywood showmanship. Witness the self-consciously florid dialogue, sometimes poetically heightened to the point of torture. Witness too the inspired scenery chewing and quasi-Scandinavian accents indulged by Hawke (gone too soon) and especially Kidman, whose performance as the seemingly demure Gudrún turns out to be one of the movie’s most deliciously barbed surprises. You may recall that Skarsgård and Kidman play a troubled couple in the HBO miniseries “Big Little Lies,” an association that gives Amleth and Gudrún’s eventual scenes together that much more of a feverish Oedipal charge. But Eggers is in no mood to hasten the family reunions and revelations, or to blow his protagonist’s cover. Amleth arrives on Fjölnir’s farm a slave, having stowed away in a boat full of war prisoners, and he’s wily enough to pass himself off for a while as a hard worker and seemingly loyal family servant. He and an enslaved ally, Olga (a fine Anya Taylor-Joy, reteaming with Eggers after “The Witch”), bide their time and share their bodies and secrets, laying the groundwork for a campaign of deadly sabotage against Fjölnir’s household. Those schemes, when they come to pass, are initially attributed to the work of evil spirits. And while Amleth will eventually take his rightful credit as the author of Fjölnir’s pain, the spirit world — the raw material of the Icelandic myths that are this story’s lifeblood — is of supreme importance here. Eggers, plunging headlong into his material, draws no distinction between fantasy and reality, though as a storyteller, he is naturally inclined toward an ardent defense of paganism in all its forms. Just as “The Witch” critiqued 17th-century Puritan repression with a gleeful embrace of nude bonfire-dancing devilry, so “The Northman,” with its ominous ravens, bearded he-witches and helmeted Valkyries, treats Viking mythology as its own living, breathing, dazzling reality. You may find yourself longing for more of that fantasy, perhaps as a distraction from the inexorable death march that Amleth’s journey is destined to become. Eggers, who likes to conjure elaborate visions only to attack their foundations from within, works hard to inflect that journey with a self-critical spirit. There’s a productive tension at the heart of “The Northman,” a tug-of-war between the Hollywood revenge-epic tradition from which it superficially hails and the sharper, more subversive dismantling of simplistic payback fantasies  it wants to be. The final passages are laced with surprises you may or may not see coming, bitter reversals of perspective that complicate — but don’t entirely mitigate — the pleasures of watching a wronged man settle an old score. Bang makes Fjölnir an implacable brute, but not an unsympathetic one. The same is true of Skarsgård, whose career-igniting role on “True Blood,” a vampire with Viking roots and the name of Eric Northman, feels like both a sequel and a warm-up act to this one. Amleth may be no unblemished hero, but with a bulging, blood-caked torso and a willingness to storm the gates of hell, he can still lead you on a trek straight to cinematic Valhalla.

"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Equal parts beautiful and desolate like a part of Iceland’s own volcanic countryside, The Northman is auteur Robert Eggers’ most straightforward film, making up in style what it gives up in the complexity of his previous films. Grabbing relentlessly from the tales of Hamlet and Beowulf, Eggers delves back into his continued curiosity about the desire for ritual and the ways it covers up the realities of existence. The story itself may not live up to the complex psychological excursions of Eggers’ previous work, but raw apocalyptic visuals have seldom been so vigorously captured. And what better story for such visuals than one of vengeance? What better story of revenge than the classic tale of Hamlet? Though Shakespeare’s version was a more courtly character piece about a man who famously couldn’t make up his mind, Alexander Skarsgård‘s Amleth has no such problems.  He knows he wants to kill his uncle for the murder of his father and rescue and he will do whatever it takes to achieve his aim, even disguising himself as a slave and being taken into the household of Fjölnir the Brotherless (The Square‘s Claes Bang) to wreak bloody havoc from within. Disguised as the mysterious Bear Wolf, Amleth sneaks out of the pen each night to kill and mutilate residents of Fjölnir’s village like some strange monster from the depths. If the story is straightforward, Eggers dresses it up in spectacular ritual, just like his Viking alter-egos. Whenever faced with momentous choices or horrible deeds, the people of Eggers’ worlds resort to dressing it up with chants and make-up and costumes and fire, distancing themselves from the brutal world they live in. It’s as close as anyone gets to reacting to the death and murder they cause to reacting to the brutality of their world. Like similar auteur, Jeremy Saulnier (whom Skarsgård has also maimed and pillaged for), the visual delight in violence and dismemberment is meant to be a commentary on how we take this sort of entertainment versus how we should take it. It’s not clear much that commentary is working when naked Vikings hack and slash at one another on the cusp of a volcano, but then again, at that point, what does it matter?  If there is a doubt in in Amleth’s mind it only comes from his growing relationship with fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) with whom he plots his attacks. But even there, all the steps forward, for how clouded in ritual they are, are cloaked in ritual. The only characters who get something like complexity are the villains, particularly Nicole Kidman‘s Gudrún, who relentlessly explains the reality of the world and his own father’s evil to Amleth. Whatever it loses in complexity, it makes up for in sheer visual power. Like Coppala’s own apocalypse, he breaks human experience down into browns of earth and reds of fire, warring for visual dominance and consuming the poor, unfortunate people caught within. From the barren white forests of Amleth’s childhood to the misty forests and caves of Fjölnir’s holdfast and the volcano that sits above it, human beings are mere ornaments on the destructive landscapes of earth, their loves and pains and hurts and joys immaterial against an unfeeling world that won’t notice them when they’ve gone. Against that sort of insignificance, it’s no wonder people cover up every element of life with ritual – if we don’t make ourselves feel important, it’s for certain nothing else will. That’s a lot of reach for something that ultimately doesn’t live up to the more complex joys of Eggers’ previous films, but sometimes you just need a simple story of a man trying to kill his uncle. Eggers and co. deliver that in spades in this beautiful Viking fable of blood and fire. Joshua Starnes has been writing about film and the entertainment industry since 2004 and served as the President of the Houston Film Critics Society from 2012 to 2019. In 2015, he became a co-owner/publisher of Red 5 Comics and, in 2018, wrote the series “Kulipari: Dreamwalker” for Netflix. In between, he continues his lifelong quest to find THE perfect tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich combination."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman, the latest film from Robert Eggers, is a guttural, ferocious viewing experience that leaves your ears ringing and your mouth agape by the final battle. This movie is so visceral you can feel it reverberating inside your body, which is exactly what makes it so delightful. Written by Eggers and Icelandic writer Sjón, The Northman is a Viking epic that refuses to gloss over the grime and blood and suggests that glory may not be so glorious after all.  THE NORTHMAN ★★★★ (4/4 stars)
Directed by: Robert Eggers
Written by: Sjón, Robert Eggers
Starring: Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Björk, Willem Dafoe
Running time: 137 mins. The film is based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which famously inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, but it doesn’t get overdrawn into myth or detailed nuance. This is a gritty tale of revenge that doesn’t require much exposition, a hallmark of Eggers’ work. The story begins in 895, in the kingdom of King Aurvandill War-Raven (a growling Ethan Hawke). After the king returns from battle, he is betrayed by his brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who kills him and claims his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) for himself. A young Prince Amleth flees the kingdom, vowing to kill his uncle and save his mother. Years later, the fledgling prince is a ripped Viking, prowling the lands and pillaging the villages with fury. The character, who vacillates between pensive humanity and animalistic ruthlessness, is perfectly embodied by Alexander Skarsgård, who was seemingly born to play this role.  Happenstance brings Amleth into the clutches of Fjölnir, now a farmer in the remote wilds of Iceland. Pretending to be a slave, Amleth infiltrates the farm, discovering that his mother is married to Fjölnir and has borne him a son. With the help of Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow slave who wields the power of sorcery, Amleth begins to exact his revenge, which is brutal, bloody, and often horrific to behold. While The Northman is not a horror movie, there are echoes of Eggers’ previous work in the genre here, including 2015’s The Witch. There are traces of the mythic, including Björk as a Seeress who predicts Amleth’s destiny, but the film’s real strength is in how aggressively primal it feels. These Vikings don’t have shiny helmets or sail majestic ships across the sea; they’re dirty, coated in dried blood and ready to slaughter each other for power or vengeance.  In some ways, The Northman feels like a risky move for Hollywood, so caught up in sequels and video-game adaptations that you’d think that was the IP available for filmmakers. Eggers is an auteur director whose last movie, The Lighthouse, was shot in black and white. The Northman is a big-budget epic, but it retains those indie roots, with Eggers bringing in all of the elements that have made his past films so aesthetically successful. The sound design, in particular, is memorable, with the guttural, bass-heavy music pulsating off the screen in a way that is both immediate and unsettling. There is a true urgency to the film. It grabs you by the throat and spits in your face, and it’s absolutely exhilarating. And it’s a visual pleasure, with Eggers embracing the scope of the Icelandic landscapes, and the pace never dulls. This is the sort of thing studios should make more of, and soon.  As Amleth, Skarsgård quavers with purpose, driving the Viking prince to his inevitable destiny. He has an unshaken purpose, even as threads of the story continue to unravel, revealing new motivations and information. A final confrontation between Amleth and Fjölnir, set in the wake of an erupting volcano, is jaw-dropping. Both Skarsgård and Bang, a vastly underrated actor, bring a sense of vulnerable viscousness to their performances, as if these men are know exactly where they’ll end up. Kidman is frosty and cunning, while Taylor-Joy plays Olga like a feisty wood nymph (it’s odd, but it works). There are perhaps not enough moments of sincere emotion, although the film does find some in the midst of all the bloodshed. At its center, The Northman is a movie about stepping into the inevitability of your fate, no matter where it may lead. It’s a furious, invigorating ride to get there.

"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"An achievement for the helmer, but he's easily distracted here, working tirelessly to manufacture an immersive viewing event, leaving dramatic power limited."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"As unusual and occasionally off-putting as The Lighthouse was, it was but a warning shot for the persistent madness of The Northman, a film designed to maintain a sense of uncanny threat in every frame."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s The Northman review says that something wild, wondrous and wicked this way comes. It’s a powerhouse you will never forget if you’re daring enough to see it. I’d heard good things about The Northman, but they did not prepare me for scope, the style, the sheer creative expanse of this dark, bloody and brilliant Viking epic. This is cinematic storytelling at its finest. Drawing from Norse and Icelandic myths, it’s also unmistakably Shakespearean in theme. Gods, Valkyries, shapeshifters, soothe sayers and even Freudian theory are violently woven together in a way that is dramatic, fascinating and creative, yet leaves no doubt about where the the plot is going and how the characters are evolving. While it’s magical, mystical and symbolic, it’s not confusing. I admire and appreciate that. The story revolves around Prince Amleth, played by Alexander Skarsgard, who, as no red-blooded appreciator of masculine pulchritude can forget, played Eric Northman in HBO’s True Blood. A young Amleth (Oscar Novak) sees his father (Ethan Hawk) slaughtered by his uncle (Claes Bang), who also abducts his mother (Nicole Kidman). As Amleth escapes, he swears to avenge his father, rescue his mother and kill his uncle. Twenty years later, Amleth has become a fearsome Viking, who has put himself in a position to do all of that and more, with the help of the mysterious and passionate Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Epic mayhem and clashes ensue—this film is not for the delicate or weak of heart. For all its darkness, tragedy and gore, there are moments of romance, whimsy and mirth. Some are perhaps unintentionally caused by the diversity of accents, but don’t let that detract from your impression of the film. No one adapts the Swedish lilt you might expect from Norse characters, but then again, it takes place in the 10th century, so who knows what people sounded like back then? Director Robert Eggers has proven himself to be a master of edgy folk horror with the celebrated The Witch and The Lighthouse, but I feel the The Northman is much more accessible, and the pinnacle of his work so far. It’s the type of movie you come away from feeling that you just saw something weighty, weird, wild and important. It’s a true cinematic experience.

"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Based on the saga that Shakespeare based Hamlet on, the story is a superficially straightforward tale of revenge, as young prince Amleth sees his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) betrayed by his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang), swears vengeance, flees into the wilderness, grows up to be Alexander Skarsgard, and realises that a life as a brutal killer just isn't enough after a mystical encounter (with Bjork no less) reminds him of his fate. Disguising himself as a slave, he sneaks aboard a ship heading to Iceland where his uncle - who has claimed his mother (Nicole Kidman) for his own - is now living on a glorified farm, having lost the family kingdom to King Harold. On the journey he meets Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who becomes his partner in crime as a fellow slave on Fjolnir's farm. And there's a lot of crime to be committed. Director Robert Eggers' previous films (The VVitch, The Lighthouse) were mostly small-scope exercises in cranking up tension through character. This is more mainstream (with a US$70 million budget to go with it), yet manages to maintain enough of his vision to never feel generic or by-the-numbers. There are plenty of offbeat touches here, but the core of the story - Amleth's quest for revenge, even if it destroys him - is always clear and at the heart of every scene. Visually this is often striking, especially in the moments of religious power and awe, but it's always in service to the story; Iceland's epic grimness is there to underline the remote and hostile nature of the environment and the people who dwell there. Likewise there's plenty of slaying, but the gore and brutality is rarely lingered on - and when it is, its to show the depths to which Amleth is willing to go to achieve his goals. If there's any drawback to this relatively straightforward approach, it's that at times the story occasionally feels a little too simple, especially during the lengthy middle section. That said, things become more complex as the film progresses, and the matter-of-fact approach to the supernatural (where it's shown to be a central part of their lives, but not to the extent that magic happens... or does it?) does add another layer to Amleth's Big Payback. The Northman is an all-too-rare example of a well-made genre film that satisfies on just about every level. Even the lengthy run time - two and a half hours if you sit through the credits - feels earned. It's the story of a shirtless warrior with a magic sword (that can only be unsheathed at night!) murdering his way through the people who took his family from him; what more could you ask for?"
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," With a pair of acclaimed, modestly budgeted efforts under his belt — 2016’s mesmerizing folk horror The Witch and 2019’s fever dream of paranoia, The Lighthouse — writer-director Robert Eggers amassed enough clout to convince studio executives to open their coffers for his most ambitious effort yet. The result is The Northman, an intensely savage revenge epic that loosely adapts the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which later became the basis for Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Viewers familiar with the latter will recognize the basic setup, which finds a young prince plotting revenge against the uncle who usurped his father’s throne. But the palace intrigue of the Bard’s version pales in comparison to the brutal and bloody approach Eggers takes to the material, where lengthy soliloquies in iambic pentameter are replaced by slashed throats, severed limbs and screams of fury. After a months-long campaign of raiding along the coastline circa 915 A.D, a critically wounded King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns home with the notion of inducting his 10-year-old son Amleth (Oscar Novak) into manhood, preparing for his inevitable ascension to the throne. The hallucinogenic ritual, overseen by Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe), is scarcely complete before Aurvendill’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) seizes upon the King’s weakened state to ambush him in the forest, beheading him as the boy looks on in horror. Amleth flees toward the shoreline — escaping one of his uncle’s lieutenants by biting off his nose — and catches a glimpse of Fjölnir parading Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) through the village before he steals a boat and rows himself out to sea, repeating his new mantra over and over again: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” Two decades later, that mantra seems all but forgotten as Amleth — draped in animal skins and now portrayed by a chiseled-as-fuck Alexander Skarsgård — leads a band of Viking raiders carving their way through the Land of the Rus, beheading and dismembering anyone who deigns to oppose them. Eggers stages one such village raid as a hypnotic single take, the camera tracking along with Amleth as he snarls, stabs and slices his way through dozens of foes with the efficiency of Godzilla stomping through a papier-mâché city block. Skarsgård is no stranger to channeling his own vaguely menacing aura whenever necessary, but rarely has he felt so overtly terrifying as he does here.  Shortly after Björk returns to the big screen — for the first time since 2005’s Drawing Restraint 9 — to remind our hero of his vow, Amleth learns his uncle was exiled from the kingdom he stole and is now lording over a remote patch of farmland somewhere in Iceland. He boards a slave ship bound for Fjölnir’s territory, disguising himself among the human chattel and striking up an alliance with a fellow captive, Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), who offers to lend her cunning to Amleth’s cause. But the vengeance our wayward Viking warrior has dreamed of will not come swiftly; Amleth aims to inflict Fjölnir with a measure of madness before stepping out of the shadows to reveal himself.  After reportedly struggling for years to mount an epic Viking saga of his own, Skarsgård has clearly thrown himself into Eggers’ latest with the full force of his capabilities, and it shows: not only does he look incredible, but he’s operating at the absolute peak of his abilities with a performance that will certainly be among the highlights of his career. He’s well matched by Taylor-Joy, who excels at crafting mysterious and enigmatic characters, and Bang, all regality and stoicism and simmering hatred, makes for an excellent foe. Kidman is used somewhat sparingly, but makes the most of her screentime, especially in some pivotal late-game sequences where the film affords her an opportunity to chew some scenery.  The Northman is steeped in the same attention to detail that left Eggers’ previous films feeling so tangible, and thanks to a reported budget of some $70 million, the work of production designer Craig Lathrop and costumer Linda Muir has never looked more impressive. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke opts for a grim, muted look that evokes the harshness of the climate and its inhabitants, and the wailing, pounding score from Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough is a perfect match for the intensity of the onscreen visuals. And what intensity: this is a film where warriors might become possessed by the spirits of wolves and bears, where deadly weapons can only function in the light of the moon, and where a climactic battle is staged on the cusp of an erupting volcano. There are numerous moments that, in the hands of another director, might have felt ridiculous, but Eggers’ depiction of bloodstained funeral rites, prophetic visions and bombastic clashes of sword and shield is so earnest — and often so trippy — that we can’t help but embrace everything The Northman throws at us and still leave the theater thirsting for more. "
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Revenge stories are as old as fiction itself. Protagonist-seeks-vengeance is a sturdy, reliable narrative arc that, when done well cinematically (Carrie, Kill Bill, John Wick, Oldboy), still delivers. When done poorly, revenge tales are belabored. Derivative. Predictable. Drab. I am delighted to report that The Northman does vengeance as well as any film in recent memory. The third feature from writer-director Robert Eggers, The Northman benefits from a budget significantly larger than those of his absolutely killer 2015 debut The Witch and 2019’s divisive but singular The Lighthouse. Yet another period piece, this one follows Viking prince and warrior Amleth, played in childhood by Oscar Novak and in adulthood by a hulking, primal Alexander Skarsgård. (Amleth, for what it’s worth, is the name of a Scandinavian legendary character who was the direct inspiration for Shakespeare’s Hamlet — and the parallels between The Northman and the melancholy Dane do not end there.) Amleth is the son of Ethan Hawke’s King Aurvandill War-Raven and Nicole Kidman’s Queen Gundrùn. He’s also the heir to his father’s kingdom before it’s seized by his villainous uncle, Aurvandill’s brother Fjölnir, who kills the king in cold blood. Thought dead, young Amleth sails off to distant lands, vowing to return and seek vengeance. Many years later, Amleth has joined up with a crew of bloodthirsty marauders, having all but abandoned his quest for revenge. That is, until one of his Viking clan’s pillaging conquests brings him in contact with a blind clairvoyant mystic played by Björk — a frequent collaborator of The Northman co-writer Sjón — who tells Amleth that his opportunity for vengeance has come. Flirtation with magical realism is a familiar theme for Eggers, who punctuates his films with hallucinatory visions and supernatural beings, some of whom may be figments of his characters’ imaginations. Posing as a slave, Amleth heads to Iceland, where his uncle — now a chieftain — has taken Gundrùn as his wife and rules over a small farming village. Amleth spends the remainder of the film plotting his uncle’s downfall alongside Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga, a sorceress and fellow slave. The Northman is full of gorgeous fire- and moonlit shots, not to mention a game of proto-lacrosse and a volcano that works a bit like Chekhov’s gun — if you show us an imposing, steaming mountain in the first act … well, we’d better see it again by the finale. There’s a murderers’ row of world-class performers here. Skarsgård — perpetually either glistening, howling or brooding — moves the plot along capably, while Taylor-Joy is enchanting as ever. Claes Bang’s Fjölnir is a compelling baddie, and Willem Dafoe is a delight in his limited time on screen as Heimir the Fool. But it shouldn’t come as any surprise that Kidman brings the house down as Queen Gundrùn, playing the character with shades of both Oedipus’ Jocasta and Hamlet’s Gertrude, and turning in the film’s best moment as The Northman approaches its climax. Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper Viking-era revenge saga were there no gore — and brother, there’s gore by the bucketful. Red-black blood spills, severed appendages abound, and eviscerated entrails cascade like so many sausage links. As a close friend of mine likes to say, Eggers delights in putting the most beautiful movie stars on the planet in remote locales and smearing their faces with muck. But amid all his mucked-up beauties, bizarre period-correct customs and glistening viscera, Eggers also knows how to build a straightforward, stakes-driven plot, marrying historical accuracy with the apocryphal lore of the given era. Thanks to intensely committed performances, the keen lensing of cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and clear motivations that drive the plot along like a humming V8 engine, The Northman does revenge as well as anyone could."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," When it comes to Robert Eggers, you either love his films or you don’t but he’s outdone himself with the new Viking film, The Northman. You might think you’ve seen a Viking film but you’ve never seen anything like The Northman. Robert Eggers has a way with cinematic language unlike any other filmmaker working today. The nonstop action films coming from the likes of Marvel and Lucasfilm might be spoiling us but this one is different. Believe me! I’m not saying it’s the best picture of the year but it would not surprise me if it is in the conversation. Of course, who knows what things will be like come November. April certainly isn’t too early of a release date but you never know. It was a very different world when The Lighthouse came into existence. Even for those fans of The Green Knight, The Northman is far superior in every way. If you’re not familiar with Norse mythology, some terminology might go over your head. If the studio plays its cards right, we’ll be talking about the production design during awards season. The production and costume designs go above and beyond. You might never see accuracy like this again. Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak/Alexander Skarsgård) should be the heir to the throne but his father (Ethan Hawke) was murdered by his uncle (Claes Bang). Making matters worse is that his uncle goes as far as kidnapping his mother (Nicole Kidman). The young prince flees by boat but vows to have his vengeance. It takes the better part of two decades but Amleth is closer to honoring his vow: avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. But in order to make this happen, he leaves his Viking crew and embeds himself on a slave slip traveling to Iceland. It’s probably not the wisest idea in the world but Amleth is on his own journey. One that now includes an enslaved woman, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). We’ve seen the basic gist of the story before. It’s a family revenge story but what Eggers and company does that elevates it to a higher level. Hamlet and The Lion King ring a bell? The Scandinavian legend of Amleth is a direct influence on William Shakespeare’s Hamlet–the more you know! In any event, the filmmakers also incorporate Icelandic sagas and Norse myths into the film. The film is still set in the 10th century but is more of an original story. Fantasy also plays a role but your mileage may vary. Behind the camera, Eggers reteams with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke. This time around, they take the single-camera approach. If you’re a longtime reader of Solzy at the Movies, Blaschke lensed one of my favorite short films in 2018, Souls of Totality. If you haven’t seen it yet, please fit some time in your schedule! But anyway, his camerawork takes advantage all the natural light that Northern Ireland–doubling for Iceland–has to offer.

"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," Four years later Eggers once again dazzled the film industry with his sophomore outing, The Lighthouse.  Starring Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man) and Robert Pattinson (The Batman) it once again showcased Eggers bizarre yet skillful talent for storytelling.  This week, with his latest movie, The Northman, Eggers offers audiences a glimpse of what Viking life may have been centuries ago. When he was a young man, Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård; True Blood) watched in secret as his uncle, Fjörlin (Claes Bang; The Girl in the Spider's Web), murdered Amleth's father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke; Moon Knight) and took his mother, Queen Gundrún (Nicole Kidman; Moulin Rouge!).  Fearing for his own life, Amleth ran away and grew up among a Viking horde, pillaging their way through Europe.  One day he stows away on a slave ship and returns to his homeland, unrecognized by his uncle.  Over time, he earns the trust of Fjörlin and his sons while secretly terrorizing them and killing his uncle's men.  With the help of a sorceress, Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), Amleth plans to free his mother and leave but once he learns the awful truth, his world is shattered forever. Eggers' first two films gave him enough clout that on this third foray into filmmaking he was able to choose from a wide array of talent.  Skarsgård was a brilliant casting choice because, with his tall frame, athletic build, and Swedish skin/hair color, he easily slips into the role of a Viking living several hundred years ago. Taylor-Joy, who first came to Hollywood's attention in Eggers' first film, The Witch, is almost ethereal with her light touch and soft-spoken words.  Kidman portrays the Queen with a warm exterior that masks the ruthless woman underneath.  Hawke and Bang are well-matched as brothers and adversaries, but they are merely tools to push the plot along and to give Amleth the motivation needed to become the man he does. There is no arguing that Eggers is a brilliant director, but I tend to find his endings to be unsatisfying and I walk away from his films angry, melancholy, and wanting something more.  His artistic vision is unique, and all his work seems to have a haziness to them with a grayish, blue tint.  The Northman is no exception and includes beautiful vistas, a solid story based on folklore and history, and supernatural people and events that defy explanation. Eggers did his research before co-writing the script and directing The Northman because many of the rituals presented in the film are believed to be historically accurate.  This adds legitimacy to the movie that otherwise could have been a cheesy parody of Viking life.  Unfortunately, this accuracy also extends to the grittier parts of the film and battle scenes are overly grotesque with flesh and blood flung everywhere. Eggers has solidified his legacy as a wonderful director and there are no doubts, he will be making movies, possibly even Oscar-worthy ones, for many years to come.  The Northman is easily identifiable as an Eggers movie that includes a great cast, haunting soundtrack, and incredible visuals.  All he needs is to chop off about twenty minutes of the film, so it doesn't drag and slow down midway through.

"Apr 20, 2022",NEGATIVE," THE NORTHMAN * (137 minutes) MA
Set amidst a variety of postcard-worthy Scandinavian locales (Iceland, mostly), The Northman is a timeless Nordic saga. Well, that’s what it feels like, anyway. A sprawling Viking epic driven by revenge, violence, bloodshed & great scenery, the saga is an inert bore stricken by leaden direction by Robert Eggers (The Witch; The Lighthouse) who, despite an obviously huge budget, renders the film with absolutely no sense of adventure or excitement. Apparently based on a Scandinavian legend of note, the yarn involves a sodden quest for revenge by prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), who isn’t happy his rotten uncle (Claes Bang) killed his dad (Ethan Hawke), then married his no-good mum (Nicole Kidman). There’s lots of howling men and mythical mumbo jumbo, with Amleth spending a lot of his time as a slave, thirsting not very convincingly for payback, growling it sporadically to remind us what is supposed to be propelling the film. For this deadly deed he requires a special sword, the kind that always have a central spot in these sorts of myth-laden movies. Think: Excalibur; Lord of the Rings; Star Wars; Conan the Barbarian; Braveheart; Highlander; The Sword and the Sorcerer; and, of course, Kill Bill. Whatever the sword’s magical powers, there’s no question how effective Amleth’s blade is; when it comes to lobbing off limbs and skewering through heads the sword operates with the ease of a warm butter knife. The film is full of grim, blood-dripping violence; innocents are slaughtered, angry men with impressive ab grids have at each other with axes, one dude literally spills his guts. At one point Amleth is so fierce he appears to kill a man merely by striking his shield. It’s a gloomy dirge, this, with no levity or even much sunlight. There’s a handful of impressive tracking shots early in the film, but aside from that the surprisingly non-widescreen cinematography is pretty drab. Kudos to Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen’s Gambit) for throwing herself into her role as a fellow slave to Amleth, though the attempts by the film’s hair and make-up department to de-beautify her fail gloriously. In a piece of predictable stunt casting Bjork has a cameo, though fans might be disappointed given how she’s barely unrecognizable under an enormous headdress that covers much of her face. Also, she doesn’t sing. Come to that, Willem Dafoe and Ethan Hawke are also hard to discern, being covered in beards, bad hair and various shades of Nordic schmutz. But you’ll know Nicole Kidman when you see her. To her credit she, like Anya Taylor-Joy, throws everything she has into her dark performance. A trouper, to the last. The film’s official running time clocks in at 137 minutes, but even if you knock off 10 minutes or so for the end credit crawl, The Northman is a slow, lumbering dirge that is way long and far more likely to have you lost in thought about your grocery list than to captivate you with its morbid, moribund tale of vengeance."
"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE," These are the words that young Viking prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, as a boy,  Alexander Skarsgård, as a man) mutters to himself repeatedly — a tripartite vow to himself to return to the kingdom from which he fled after his evil uncle, Fjölnir, murdered his father the King and married his mother the Queen. Something is rotten in the fictional island kingdom of Hrafnsey, in other words. The Northman doesn't so much adopt the plot of Hamlet as dig beneath it to unearth the ur-story that predates Shakespeare by centuries. So while the tale's broad strokes are familiar, its particulars can vary in intriguing ways. As played with feral, foaming rage by a sinewy Skarsgård, for example, Amleth is no dithering Dane who chooses to procrastinate from the bloody task before him by flouncing around a castle, mumbling existential monologues to himself. No, this guy joins up with a band of berserkers who deck themselves out in wolf-pelt drag and pillage settlements throughout Eastern Europe. Like Hamlet, however, Amleth forgets himself, getting so caught up in his life of murder (and, from the available evidence, in his Crossfit routine) that he gets remonstrated by an otherworldly Seeress (Björk, somehow inevitably) who reminds him of his vow. There's a ruthless efficiency to Robert Eggers' third feature, which tamps down the director's surreal, experimental sensibility — or at least, cordons it off from the main action and shunts it into the realm of dreams, visions and fevers; it's a surprisingly conventional storytelling choice from such an unconventional director.  The story, co-written by Eggers and the Icelandic poet Sjón, is in fact so straightforward and familiar that you might find yourself, as I did, growing impatient for those moments of the fantastic and otherworldly, for the gods and monsters of Viking culture to insert themselves into the proceedings. Whenever they do, it's thrilling, as Eggers is a deft hand at letting one world bleed into the other. When revenge drives the plot, it can't help but imbue the proceedings with a satisfying pulpiness, which is probably why The Northman, for all its vaunted, assiduous attention to historical accuracy, somehow ends up having so much of Conan the Barbarian and Assassin's Creed Valhalla to it. That's not meant to disparage Eggers' film — both Conan and ACV deliver on their premises. But where, for example, the actors in The Witch spoke period-appropriate Early Modern English dialogue, the characters of The Northman speak English inflected with vaguely Scandinavian consonants (""Neverrr enterrr my bedchamberrrrr without knockinggg-ga!""), which can't help but admit some small amount of cheesiness to the mix. There are, amid all the starkly beautiful landscapes and the starkly brutal violence, a handful of small, human touches that help keep things emotionally grounded. Anya Taylor-Joy plays Olga, Amleth's ally and love-interest, as someone far more wise about the ways of the heart than he could ever hope to be, which sets up one of the film's nicer twists. Claes Bang gets to shade the evil, usurping Fjölnir with more emotional layers as he ages. Ultimately, The Northman may have less to say about the nature of violence, and the perverse traps that simplistic notions of masculinity and honor lay for the soul, than last year's similarly evocative medieval meditation The Green Knight. But that David Lowery film set out to be something that audiences grappled with and argued over.  I get the sense that Eggers' goal here is a simpler, more direct one — to interpret a very old story anew, to deliver the narrative goods (betrayal, murder, revenge, redemption) with the help of his largest budget yet, and to let Björk be Björk, in all her sublime Björkiness. In this, The Northman delivers."

"Apr 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"        Faruk (Pavle Cemerikic), a teenager, lives with his grandmother (Irena Mulamuhic) in a poor neighborhood of Sarajevo. He struggles to make a living selling scrap metal and joins his friend, Almir (Kerim Cutuna), to work for a mob boss Cedo (Ermin Bravo) who's involved with sex trafficking local women. At an outdoor shopping mall, he meets and flirts with Mona (Sumeja Dardagan), a 9th grader who comes from an affluent hom. He gives her his phone number in hope that he can groom her into being one of girls that Cedo will bring into the sex trafficking world. Mona texts Faruk in class one day and they agree to meet up. Gradually, they start falling for each other and, soon enough, he's torn between his life of crime and his newfound love.         The White Fortress is  The screenplay by writer/director Igor Drljaca has a plot that seems simple on the surface, but it becomes increasingly complex and even surprising. Faruk and Mona come from different socio-economic backgrounds, yet they get along with each other. In a way, they're both trapped in a prison without bars and yearn to escape from it even though they're not emotionally mature enough to know how to. They're also both lonely and don't have anyone to really talk to in their lives. Faruk's friend, Almir, is far from a good influence or a good role model. Fortunately, the romance between Faruk and Mona feels true-to-life without any cheesiness or maudlin scenes. You learn just enough about what their lives are like to get to know them as human beings. Is their love real and true? Is it sustainable? Or are they just two naive teenagers? Kudos to writer/director Igor Drljaca for not judging them or anyone else in the film. The only character closest to a villain is Cedo, but the film isn't really about him or about the sex trafficking industry. The White Fortress could've easily become a dark, gritty suspense thriller, but instead it takes the less easy route by exploring the dynamics of the relationship between Faruk and Mona while humanizing them in the process.         Pavle Cemerikic and Sumeja Dardagan both give very natural, raw and convincingly moving performances that breathe even more life into their roles. They have great chemistry together, and you can feel the connection between Faruk and Mona from the very beginning which makes it easier for you to root for them to be together. The third act, like much of the film, doesn't offer any easy answers or wrap everything up nearly in a bow-tie for that matter. Without revealing any spoilers, it's a poignant and haunting ending that will linger in your mind for a long time. It also includes some visual poetry as well as poetry through words which adds both style and substance to the film. Poetry is often a form of protest for or against, so in this case, the film is a protest for love and against hate. That's a vital and profound message to send to the audience, but Drljaca sends it in a way that avoids preachiness and heavy-handedness. At a running time of just 1 hour and 28 minutes, The White Fortress a tender, bittersweet and genuinely heartfelt love story.

"Apr 20, 2022",POSITIVE,Robert Eggers is a visual master.
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"It is melodrama, and murder and mayhem and witchcraft; its everything Robert Eggers does best on the biggest scale, and its his best film yet."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," Courtesy Focus FeaturesThe legendary Scandinavian tale of Amleth is considered one of the primary sources of inspiration behind William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. Just look at the anagram stylings of Hamlet’s name as evidence. However, nothing has quite captured the sweeping epic feel onscreen that the tale of Amleth requires. Thankfully, Robert Eggers‘ THE NORTHMAN is now my go-to example of how to deliver an epic and make it feel like an epic for the big screen. A tale of brutal revenge, Eggers takes us through Amleth’s journey with ease, melding the Norse paganism well with a grounded visceral realism. An immersive, captivating experience, it will be difficult for the audience not to look away as we see Amleth’s fateful journey reach its natural conclusion. THE NORTHMAN stars Alexander Skarsgård (“Big Little Lies”), Nicole Kidman (“Nine Perfect Strangers”), Claes Bang (“Dracula“), Anya Taylor-Joy (Last Night in Soho), Gustav Lindh (Queen of Hearts), Ethan Hawke (“Marvel’s Moon Knight“), Björk (Dancer in the Dark), and Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man: No Way Home). The film is directed by Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse), with a screenplay written by Eggers and Sjón. THE NORTHMAN is a straightforward tale of revenge, with a protagonist who steadfastly pushes forward. As storytelling goes, this follows what you would expect from a legendary tale that you’d expect told around a fire. From a small pup to the grown bear-wolf berserker warrior, Alexander Skarsgård perfectly encapsulates the warrior with a thirst for blood. However, Skarsgård invokes nuance. There are glimpses of what could have been conveyed in his gaze as he watches his fellow warriors engage in brutalities. Or, how he goes to the defense of a child to spare him pain. In these moments we see a note of the cyclic violence of the time period as well as the violent nature of men themselves. Violence begets violence, matriculating down the bloodlines until no one is left. We see this illustrated through Amleth’s kin. Ethan Hawke’s King Aurvandill War-Raven and Claes Bang’s Fjölnir the Brotherless continue the precedent set by their ancestors. Brother killing brother in an act of conquest, but it doesn’t stop there. No, there is a ripple effect from their actions revealed later on in the film outside of its direct impact on Amleth. And the discovery is what truly pushes Amleth from boyhood into manhood. The knowledge that what we perceive as children becomes a lot more nuanced as adults. What becomes a quest for revenge becomes muddied, and highlights the grey areas which Eggers loves to explore and sift through. The guiding factors that muddy the waters with the knowledge they have to provide are the two primary female characters in the film. Nicole Kidman’s Queen Gudrún starts off as a mother and, arguably, starts off as a weakly developed character. However, this is intentional. Much of the perception of this character is provided by Amleth, who sees her through a child’s mindset. As THE NORTHMAN continues on, we learn more about her character, which transforms everything. While the transition could have been stronger in her performance in these moments, what Kidman provides serves its purpose. It is a bucket of cold water to the face. Much like Amleth, we too awaken to the realities of this world we’re in. Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest serves to guide and remind us of reality just as much as she does Amleth. While a sorceress, she points out reason to Amleth while he fixates on vengeance. She warns him. Yearns for him. Tries to steer him away from what fate has in store for him while also operating on her own agenda. While on paper the character of Olga serves as an archetype in some ways, Taylor-Joy’s performance elevates it beyond what it could have been. Endlessly compelling, no one would complain about more screentime for Olga. While conveying an epic tale, immersion is the key to success. Eggers and his team spared no expense in making sure that the audience is fully immersed in the world of THE NORTHMAN. The first step towards that immersion is via the sound design and the score, which is the audience’s gateway into the world. Composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough do an impeccable job here utilizing folk instruments from the region that tap into the ritualistic wonder that the culture brings. An easy soundtrack purchase when available, there is something, cinematic and oddly soothing about the score. In a theatrical setting, the score is a true highlight for that immersion. From Linda Muir’s costume designs to Craig Lathrop’s production design to the set decoration, the world of these legendary Viking cultures is brought to life. This should come as no surprise for those who have followed Eggers’ films leading up to this point. There is no expense spared on the investment in the art department on THE NORTHMAN. The same can be said about any of the departments in the film. For those who look at crafts, this film is the one for you. The level of research done on this project shines onscreen. From the intricate carvings of Odin in the sacred space to the sword designs to the traditional Slavic garb worn by Olga and her people earlier on in the film, it’s a cornucopia of research and care brought to life. If there is any complaint, it would be a need for a slightly smoother edit transition between a couple of the vision scenes. But that’s it. To all the teams who worked in these departments, a job well done! Absolutely impeccable. Of course, crafts cannot be mentioned without invoking cinematography, and Jarin Blaschke‘s lens is a huge component in elevating THE NORTHMAN to its rightful epic status. The film accidentally becomes a walking advertisement for Iceland, with Blaschke capturing the ethereal, majestic quality of Iceland’s landscape to perfection. God-like and mighty, the environment dwarfs the people who occupy its land. Close-up shots of the character’s faces allow us to take in Amleth’s perspective numerous times. Again, this is Amleth’s tale and we are experiencing things as he does. So, these shots work effectively here. A note must also be made regarding the sweeping tracking shot utilized in the much-talked-about one-shot battle sequence, where the stunts team truly excelled in the choreography. Brutal, dirty, and reveling in violence, Blaschke makes sure to capture every moment of the brutality we see Amleth and his comrades enact onscreen. Had the film been shot in any other way, I’m not certain it would have achieved the magic and bigger-than-life feeling that Blaschke managed to bring to THE NORTHMAN. THE NORTHMAN is everything a nerdy Nordic folklore person could possibly desire. The amount of research and care that went into this film radiates off the screen and smacks you in the face. Eggers has set the bar for these kinds of films moving forward. This is how epics should be done. From the visuals to the performances to its score, everything comes together to create a fully immersive experience for the audience. THE NORTHMAN excels.

"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," A heady ritual concoction of pitiless Dark Ages brutality and dazzling mythic imagery, The Northman is every inch the bloody, howling Viking action epic that one would expect director Robert Eggers to birth into the world. If the esteemed American auteur’s third feature film feels a little conventional, it’s mostly due to the comparative bracing originality of his virtuosic folk-horror masterpiece The Witch (2015) and his cabin-fever freakout The Lighthouse (2019). The premise of The Northman is the kind of savagely straightforward affair that almost feels out of fashion in contemporary big-budget filmmaking. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: An exiled prince seeks vengeance on behalf of his father, a righteous king murdered and usurped by his treasonous brother, who has taken the widowed queen as his bride for good measure. If this sounds suspiciously like Hamlet – or, if you prefer, Legend of the Black Scorpion (2006) or The Lion King (1994) or Strange Brew (1983) – it’s because it is Hamlet. Or, more accurately, it is Eggers and Icelandic poet Sjón’s take on the medieval Danish legend of Amleth, which passed through various Latin, French, and English mutations before landing in the lap of William Shakespeare. Much as Eggers returned to the Puritan source of America’s nightmares in The Witch, here the filmmaker ushers the viewer back three centuries before Amleth’s name was ever inscribed on parchment. Amid the fire and ice of pagan Scandinavia, the viewer bears witness to a possible origin for the Western canon’s ur-tragedy, the grain of sand that begat the pearl. However, The Northman is not the “real” story of Prince Hamlet, any more than the real King Lear can be found in 11th-century Welsh pseudo-histories. Around the sturdy mythic pillars of regicide-slash-fratricide and seething vengeance, Eggers and Sjón have fashioned an almost-original creation, a mud-and-gore-slicked work of historical verisimilitude spiked with fly agaric and raging testosterone. “Realism” isn’t really the right word, given that the story involves a prophecy from a blind Russian witch, a barrow wight guarding a magic blade, and a naked Viking duel in the caldera of an active volcano. It’s about as grounded as a Heavy Metal magazine cover. However, The Northman’s goal is not to re-create the past with perfect fidelity, but to thrust the viewer into a worldview 1,200 years removed from their own. This is not how the world was, but how it was seen: As a realm ruled by violence both sacred and profane, where destiny is as implacable as death and eternal glory arrives on celestial hoofbeats. Young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) lives and breathes the war-etched rules of this world. The only child of King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrún (Nichole Kidman), he has been raised to one day assume the throne of his father’s petty Nordic kingdom. Unfortunately, the king’s green-eyed brother Fjölnir has designs on that throne, and he’s not about to let a little thing like divine law stand his way. Shortly after Amleth’s coming-of-age ceremony – a feral, chthonian rite in which father and son lap blood and howl like wolves before Auvandil’s grinning jester-priest (Willem Dafoe) – Fjölnir and his collaborators ambush the king and cut him down like a dog. Amleth, however, evades the assassins and steals a boat, although he lingers just long enough to witness Fjölnir carrying away his screaming mother while the king’s loyalists are slaughtered. As he rows away from his shattered family and stolen future, Amleth spits an Arya Stark-worthy oath with every stroke of the oars: “I will avenge you, Father! I will save you, Mother! I will kill you, Fjölnir!” Twenty years later, however, Amleth (now played by an absurdly buff Alexander Skarsgård) seems to have tabled revenge in favor of those reliable Viking pastimes, wanton slaughter and plunder. When the film catches up with him, the erstwhile prince is a wolfskin-clad berserker serving under the banner of a nameless warlord, reaving settlements in far Eastern Europe (“the land of the Rus’”). In the aftermath of one such raid, Amleth encounters a freshly blinded witch (Icelandic songstress Björk) who foresees that he will soon have his vengeance against Fjölnir. The seer’s words seem to stoke the embers of Amleth’s long-dormant hunger for retribution. When he later overhears that some of the captured thralls will be sent to “Fjölnir the Brotherless,” he breaks away from his fellow warriors, brands himself with a slaver’s mark, and slips aboard a longship bound for his uncle’s holdfast in distant Iceland. Along the way, he befriends fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sharp-tongued sorceress who is shrewd enough to recognize him as one of the frenzied warriors who burned her village. She is open about her intent to escape her newfound bondage by any means necessary, and she and Amleth quickly strike up an alliance fueled by their shared clarity of purpose (plus a little animal lust). As it turns out, Fjölnir has not prospered from his treachery: Exiled from Norway by the high king, his holdings have been reduced to an isolated longhouse, a band of ragged warriors, and a herd of sheep. Fate might have humbled the king-killer, but this does not dissuade Amleth. Neither does the revelation that his mother has birthed Fjölnir a young son (Elliott Rose) during her captivity. Omens guide Amleth to a half-crazed Odin-worshipping hermit (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson), who in turn points him to a legendary sword. This blade can only be unsheathed at night, but it thirsts for the blood of traitors. The broad strokes of this plot are almost disarmingly familiar. The Northman is, at bottom, a tale of righteous vengeance: A father is killed, a son kills the killer, roll credits. For this reason alone, Eggers’ third feature never feels quite as revelatory as The Witch or The Lighthouse, films in which spiritual terror and paranoid fantasy blurred into reality (or, in the latter film’s case, swallowed it completely). In comparison, The Northman almost feels like accessible big-budget Hollywood entertainment, a tale in which the chiseled hero announces to the heavens what he intends to do – kill, kill, kill, fuck, kill – and then does so with great enthusiasm. Which isn’t to say that Eggers’ latest work is one that plays by the rules of some dog-eared screenwriter’s guide. The Northman has a habit of upending the viewer’s expectations about how revenge epics are “supposed” to work. The plot has an almost theatrical intimacy, encompassing just three key locations and a handful of characters. Fjölnir’s off-screen downfall to glorified shepherd punctures the assumption that Amleth will be gathering an army and storming his father’s former stronghold. From the moment that he arrives in Iceland in chains, the prince’s revenge becomes less about forward momentum than watching, planning, and waiting. To even describe the film as an “epic” feels a bit misleading. There are no sweeping battle sequences or meandering journeys through strange lands. The Northman’s marquee action set piece is essentially a massacre, one in which Amleth’s raiding party hacks their way through warriors and civilians alike, roaring with bloodlust – every gruesome detail captured in a pulse-pounding long take that follows along at the exiled prince's eye level. If the film’s structure and presentation feel a tad unorthodox, however, then its setting is downright heretical. The Northman drops the viewer into surroundings that feel markedly alien. On the well-worn anvil of treachery and revenge, the director and his collaborators have forged a strange, long-vanished world, one in which you-killed-my-father fury is virtually the only recognizable handhold. The Northman might be the most resolutely estranging historical epic since Hsiao-Hsien Hou’s The Assassin (2016), and yet it is also an immersive experience, a work of displacing magic that envelops the viewer in Amleth's haunted, absolutist headspace. The reality conjured by the film’s crew – including production designer Craig Lathrop, set decorator Niamh Coulter, and costume designer Linda Muir – is undeniably vivid and transporting. However, the oceanic grasp of The Northman has as much to do with unflinching adherence to a pre-Christian mentality as it does with painstakingly re-created 9th-century clothing and furnishings. Eggers’ film depicts a time and place completely divorced from contemporary notions of order, justice, and morality. The Northman sets this grisly, unsettling tone early, as Amleth’s raiding party rounds up the young, the elderly, and the infirm – who have little value as thralls – and burns them alive inside a locked house. A different film might have used this as a character-defining moment for its protagonist, obliging the hero to express a reassuringly anachronistic disgust with such barbarism. Instead, Amleth simply looks on in slack disinterest as his battle frenzy cools. Although a few aspects of The Northman’s setting might be appealing to certain viewers – even the slaves get to partake in the mead-soaked woodland orgies, after all – it is overall a harsh and frightening place. For most folk in this world, their existence is dominated by violence and bondage, and the scant comforts offered by the unyielding Fates are decidedly cold. In a realm of such chaos, Amleth puts his faith in his own formidable strength and in the long arc of Odin’s retribution. Accordingly, his eye is watchful for signs from the All-father’s raven messengers and from the midnight-blue fox that seems to haunt his steps on the tundra. Such is his certainty in the witch’s prophecy that Amleth balks when opportunities to quickly and cleanly end Fjölnir’s life present themselves. He is destined to meet his foe at “the gates of Hel,” and to contravene this fate would be its own kind of blasphemy. Of course, witches cannot foresee everything. For one, nothing is quite as it appears in Fjölnir’s longhouse, where motives are slippery and the distinctions between heroes and villains are a matter of perspective. For another, Amleth’s conspiratorial bond with Olga blossoms into something sweeter and more nourishing than either anticipated, and such feelings risk complicating his quest. Or they would, if there were any chance of Amleth being dissuaded from his vengeful path. “You must choose between kindness for your kin and hatred for your enemies,” the sepulchral voice of the king’s long-dead fool warns, but any true Viking knows that it’s really no choice at all. Blood must be repaid with blood."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," By all rights, The Northman shouldn’t exist. The Regency/Focus Features film is an entirely original (in terms of not being explicitly based on anything), R-rated, star-free (talent aside, Alexander Skarsgård and Anya-Taylor Joy are not butts-in-seats draws), 142-minute, $90 million Viking actioner. Spending $90 million on a movie like this was madness 11 years ago when Jason Momoa starred in a Conan the Barbarian reboot, and that had an IP and existed during a time when folks went to the movies on the regular. Heck, $65 million, the initial budget prior to Covid-related overruns, was itself absurd. The box office pundit in me is aghast that this film exists in its current form. But the film critic in me will happily chow down on its cinematic pleasures knowing that they are in short supply. The Northman shares more than a few similarities with Walt Disney’s The Lion King, to the point where it’s more of a “rip-off, don’t remake” riff on that Disney toon than Hamlet. We get a young man idolizing his royal father followed by a family betrayal that leaves the king (Ethan Hawke) dead, the queen (Nicole Kidman) in captivity and our would-be heir in exile. Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse and The Witch) almost at once switches things up just a little. We quickly discover that the treacherous uncle (Claes Bang) lost his ill-gotten throne and has become the head of a far quainter village. Our now-grown “hero” (a ripped-to-the-gills Skarsgård) has aligned himself with Viking hordes committing the very same sort of horrors visited upon him as a boy. Survival is the name of the game. The stunning series of one-take sequences (they look like one-ers to me, and I’m not the edit police) highlighting the Viking horde plundering makes a point not to show Amleth partaking in any rape or baby murder. However, these new friends have a quite different definition of “Hakuna Matata.” Upon seeing a chance to enact his long-sought-after revenge, Amleth cuts his hair and sneaks onto a slave ship in the guise of a common slave. That whole “long hair, ripped bod” look that’s been central to the marketing campaign applies to one single scene. The rest of the movie is mostly our anti-hero making trouble for his sworn enemy while (James Bond-style) concurrently gaining his trust. Meanwhile, Olga (Taylor-Joy) claims to be a sorcerer but does not do much sorcery beyond feminine whiles. The film dives headfirst into the “macho men being stupid for the sake of masculine pride” thing, complete with a king who really wishes to die amid battle and a “hero” who is torn between (to quote a refrain) “kindness to your kin or hatred for your enemy.” The shifting morality and implicit subversion of its genre tropes will have you periodically “rooting against action.” The Northman is less a deconstruction and more an example of itself sans the comforting heroic myths that have allowed such tales to become pop culture dogma. That even applies to the deluge of third-act false endings, which seem to go out of their way to snatch away conventional resolutions. Even if the message sometimes interferes with the medium, the 142-minute flick is rarely less than in-the-moment engrossing. Even with that $90 million budget, there is a certain frugal discipline. There exists a certain “do what you can with what you've got” mentality that occasionally makes it feel almost more impressive than if it were the beneficiary of a bottomless piggy bank. Nothing about this film looks accidental. In terms of its subject matter, it seems like a spear thrown directly into the heart of the “You can’t make this movie today because of political correctness” discourse, as The Northman, even with its heart in the right place, is filled with allegedly “problematic” content. Warts and all, The Northman (with stark, oppressive cinematography courtesy of Jarin Blaschke and razor-sharp editing by Louise Ford) is worth that PLF upcharge. It’s a relic from when studios would expect audiences to show up in theaters and buy the DVD."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE,Once you settle in for the ride and commit yourself to whatever hellish vision Eggers cultivates&#44; &quot;The Northman&quot; doesn&apos;t just subvert expectations&#44; it obliterates them&#46;
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," Starring Alexander Skarsgård, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, and Anya Taylor-Joy, The Northman is the latest film by Robert Eggers, following his previous films The Witch and The Lighthouse. The Northman follows Viking prince Amleth (Skarsgard) embarking on a quest to avenge his father’s murder at the hands of his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang).
Before you say anything, yes–it is essentially Hamlet, or if you would prefer, The Lion King. Unlike Shakespeare and Disney’s takes on the familiar legend, Eggers and co-screenwriter and Icelandic author Sjón take The Northman back to its Old Norse roots, which combines Icelandic dialogue with the savagery of the Viking Age. With some already touting this as ‘this generation’s Gladiator‘, can The Northman revive the genre of epic revenge film?

Set in the North Atlantic, young Amleth witnesses Fjölnir murder his father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and ravage his village while capturing his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Forced to leave for his own safety, he swears by a simple mantra: ‘I will avenge you Father. I will save you Mother. I will kill you Fjölnir’ – creating a vendetta that continues into adulthood. Growing up to become a hardened warrior, Amleth seeks a chance to avenge his loved ones.
Despite the initial upset that Skarsgård’s character is not called Eric (referring to his True Blood character Eric Northman, who, coincidentally, had a similar vendetta against his father’s murderer), The Northman presents itself as a graphically complex film with an overly simplistic plot.
The sole focus of the plot is Amleth’s revenge, whose trauma and harsh upbringing have created a cold-hearted protagonist. With a protagonist resistant to a life and meaning bar his vendetta, the narrative prevents other characters from contributing to not only his emotional development but also their own. With his father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) being the sole point of affection as a child, it seems that Amleth’s vengeful fate is sealed when he witnesses his murder.
As a result, he prevents himself from becoming close to anyone and nobody can ‘rescue’ him from his dark intentions, despite Amleth’s love interest Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Gudrún unveiling chinks in his armor. With Amleth being so isolated from everyone, he does come across as a one-dimensional, unrelenting character, causing us to question whether more could have been done with him as a protagonist.

Its simplicity might make The Northman Eggers’ most accessible film to date, but it doesn’t stop it from being unrelentingly brutal. Its graphic and violent scenes of murder, decapitations (of both men and horses), and sacrifices are uncomfortable viewing for squeamish audiences but enhance the primal natures of its characters, with a village raid being an early yet memorable standout.

As Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s booming score fortifies The Northman’s foreboding tone, Eggers’ slow and unforgiving direction evokes a deep and disturbing calm around the chaos, with centered shots almost forcing audiences to experience each scene head-on. In addition, Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography makes the most of Iceland’s lush landscapes and copious amounts of firelight to add an unsettling sense of mystery and scale to the screenplay, which is driven by Skarsgård’s imposing and dominating performance.
One of the key things that add complexity to the plot is the handful of female characters, which not only includes Olga of the Birch Forest and Queen Gudrún but also The Seer (Björk),  as they easily evoke reactions through their whispers, spells, and foresight.

The lovely Olga is an unassuming sorceress (hinting at a continuation of her breakthrough performance in The Witch) and Björk delivers a brief yet haunting performance as the Seer, both of whom tap into Amleth’s rage-riddled heart. Meanwhile, Kidman makes an impact as Gudrún, whose manipulation causes her son to second-guess his vendetta through harsh truths during an intimate yet disturbing scene.
Although the men easily lead the charge on the battlefield, the quietness and complexity of these women make them – in a way – more powerful than their male peers, while raising the subtle mysticism littered throughout the narrative.
At 137 minutes, The Northman occasionally feels dragged out as Amleth takes his time to wreak vengeance amid violent raids and occasional spiritual scenes that hint that there is more guiding him besides revenge. However, Eggers doesn’t compromise on the brutality and scale of his latest feature, creating a visually compelling and absorbing thriller. Combined with Skarsgård’s powerful performance, The Northman cements a welcome return to the cinematic historical epic.

 Before you say anything, yes–it is essentially Hamlet, or if you would prefer, The Lion King. Unlike Shakespeare and Disney’s takes on the familiar legend, Eggers and co-screenwriter and Icelandic author Sjón take The Northman back to its Old Norse roots, which combines Icelandic dialogue with the savagery of the Viking Age. With some already touting this as ‘this generation’s Gladiator‘, can The Northman revive the genre of epic revenge film?

Set in the North Atlantic, young Amleth witnesses Fjölnir murder his father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), and ravage his village while capturing his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Forced to leave for his own safety, he swears by a simple mantra: ‘I will avenge you Father. I will save you Mother. I will kill you Fjölnir’ – creating a vendetta that continues into adulthood. Growing up to become a hardened warrior, Amleth seeks a chance to avenge his loved ones.
Despite the initial upset that Skarsgård’s character is not called Eric (referring to his True Blood character Eric Northman, who, coincidentally, had a similar vendetta against his father’s murderer), The Northman presents itself as a graphically complex film with an overly simplistic plot.
The sole focus of the plot is Amleth’s revenge, whose trauma and harsh upbringing have created a cold-hearted protagonist. With a protagonist resistant to a life and meaning bar his vendetta, the narrative prevents other characters from contributing to not only his emotional development but also their own. With his father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) being the sole point of affection as a child, it seems that Amleth’s vengeful fate is sealed when he witnesses his murder.
As a result, he prevents himself from becoming close to anyone and nobody can ‘rescue’ him from his dark intentions, despite Amleth’s love interest Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Gudrún unveiling chinks in his armor. With Amleth being so isolated from everyone, he does come across as a one-dimensional, unrelenting character, causing us to question whether more could have been done with him as a protagonist.

Its simplicity might make The Northman Eggers’ most accessible film to date, but it doesn’t stop it from being unrelentingly brutal. Its graphic and violent scenes of murder, decapitations (of both men and horses), and sacrifices are uncomfortable viewing for squeamish audiences but enhance the primal natures of its characters, with a village raid being an early yet memorable standout.

As Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s booming score fortifies The Northman’s foreboding tone, Eggers’ slow and unforgiving direction evokes a deep and disturbing calm around the chaos, with centered shots almost forcing audiences to experience each scene head-on.

 The lovely Olga is an unassuming sorceress (hinting at a continuation of her breakthrough performance in The Witch) and Björk delivers a brief yet haunting performance as the Seer, both of whom tap into Amleth’s rage-riddled heart. Meanwhile, Kidman makes an impact as Gudrún, whose manipulation causes her son to second-guess his vendetta through harsh truths during an intimate yet disturbing scene.
Although the men easily lead the charge on the battlefield, the quietness and complexity of these women make them – in a way – more powerful than their male peers, while raising the subtle mysticism littered throughout the narrative.
At 137 minutes, The Northman occasionally feels dragged out as Amleth takes his time to wreak vengeance amid violent raids and occasional spiritual scenes that hint that there is more guiding him besides revenge. However, Eggers doesn’t compromise on the brutality and scale of his latest feature, creating a visually compelling and absorbing thriller. Combined with Skarsgård’s powerful performance, The Northman cements a welcome return to the cinematic historical epic.

"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," Gritty, bloody, visceral and front-loaded with a need for vengeance, the latest work from writer/director Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) is so immersive and authentic, you’ll feel the muck between your toes and every blow across your body. Based loosely on a story that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet and co-written with Icelandic scribe Sjón, The Northman follows the life of Viking prince Amleth (re-arrange the letters; you’ll get it), who begins the film as a boy (circa 895 AD), waiting with his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), for his triumphant father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), to return from war. Soon after he comes back, he takes young Amleth to a sacred place where the boy goes through a ceremony to become a man, under the watchful eye of the court fool, Weimir (Willem Dafoe). Shortly after they emerge from this primal event, the king is attacked and murdered by his own brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), sending Amleth running into the woods swearing revenge and leaving his mother to an unknown fate (unless you know Hamlet). When Amleth grows up (and is played by a fully ripped Alexander Skarsgård), he hasn’t lost his fire to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. Now part of a Viking horde, he raids and pillages villages, killing with such severity any who challenge him that we can easily see how brutally his uncle will eventually die. In fact, after one such raid, Amleth encounters a Seeress (Björk, playing this fortuneteller exactly how you need her to do so), who has a vision of this young man killing his uncle, leading Amleth to leave the horde, sneak on a boat and head back home to honor his oath. On board, he meets Olag (Anya Taylor-Joy), a slave woman claiming to be a sorceress; Amleth enlists her to help his crusade. By chance, the boat is headed to his homeland, where he is stunned to discover that his mother apparently is the willing queen of his uncle, and they have a young son, Gunnar. As a result, Amleth formulates a plan to slowly pick off some of his uncle’s most trusted men, while he and his fellow Vikings work as faceless slave laborers that no one would suspect of rising against their betters. Eventually Amleth reveals himself, and much hell breaks loose. The Northman is filmmaking as full-contact sports, filled with not just action, but also with the sights, smells and sounds of the period, the camera lens caked in grime, blood and rage. In all his sinewy swagger, Skarsgård is built of raw, unchecked emotion, which threatens to make him act impulsively rather than plot out his revenge with care and intelligence. The real surprise here is Kidman, who goes from loving, adoring mother and wife to something much different in the second half of the movie. The sequence in which she is reunited with Amleth is perhaps the best in the entire film, due in large part to Kidman’s performance. The film’s final battle between Amleth and Fjölnir, literally set at the Gates of Hel (an active volcano) is as ferocious a swordfight as you will ever see on the big screen. As with all of Eggers films, The Northman isn’t afraid to be painstakingly authentic to the period while also bringing in the supernatural, with its parade of fortune tellers, sorceresses, and constant discussions of Norse gods and Valhalla. There’s a final vision in the movie that is breathtaking in its beauty and its glimpse of hope in a film that doesn’t offer much of either in the traditional sense. There were moments during The Northman where I wanted to stand up and cheer, just as a way of celebrating the scale and execution of the filmmaker’s vision (luckily, Eggers was given a sizable budget to turn his vision into reality). Perhaps more than his other two features, I got more of a sense of the psychological damage that Amleth carried with him since childhood, and that pushes a great deal of the film forward in endlessly fascinating and propulsive ways. Better still, Eggers didn’t have to abandon the cinematic qualities that make his works wonderfully bizarre in places. Still rough around the edges, a cold serrated blade at its core, and remarkably photographed by Jarin Blaschke, The Northman is perfectly merciless filmmaking, as it should be.

"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE," If I had to choose one word to describe Robert Eggers’s new Viking epic The Northman, it would be: “Yaaaaaarghghghghhgghghghghghh!” The brutal, bloody and bare-chested revenge thriller is essentially one big, long war cry – a guttural, primal grunt of a movie that is all raging testosterone and incendiary machismo. And I loved nearly every minute of it. A retelling of Hamlet – or rather a pretelling of it, given that Shakespeare’s work was directly inspired by the medieval Scandinavian legend that Eggers and his co-writer, the Icelandic poet Sjon, explore here – The Northman follows the riches-to-rags tale of Amleth, who as a young boy watches his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murder his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) and kidnap his mother Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Escaping his own death thanks to the incompetence of Fjolnir’s lackey, Amleth flees for Iceland, uttering a vengeance mantra that carries him through years of hardship: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” Flash-forward a few decades and Amleth is a strapping, frequently shirtless berserker warrior (Alexander Skarsgard), who spends his days raiding Slavic villages and generally terrorizing the world. Until one moment of fate leads him back to his original quest for comeuppance, which ropes in the beautiful slave/pseudo-witch Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) and two spiritual figures (one played by an eye-less Bjork, the other by the talking skull of Willem Dafoe – it’s just that kind of movie). From there, Eggers plunges audiences into a thundering enterprise of high-budget carnage, the kind of cinematic experience that leaves you feeling sucker-punched, exhausted and somehow hungry for more. Guts are spilled, throats are slit, and the lines between what is real and what is imagined are blurred with the thick smudging of blood. The film is a marked step up – in size, ambition, artistic commitment – for Eggers, who digs further here into his obsession with how our natural world exists alongside a more magical realm, after similar explorations in The Witch (starring Joy) and The Lighthouse (featuring Dafoe). But while Eggers’s previous films were exercises in different, competing stylistic approaches – rigidly controlled for The Witch, and unrestrained gonzo-ness for The Lighthouse – The Northman is a delightful marriage of the two. It takes masterful precision, for instance, to stage The Northman’s single-take village raid, which follows Amleth as he and his fellow wolf warriors burn an entire settlement to the ground. Just as it takes an unhinged imagination to come up with Amleth and Fjolnir’s climactic Gates of Hell volcano-backdropped sword battle, a moment of fiery madness that is beyond outrageous. Which makes Eggers’s recent comments in The New Yorker that this version of The Northman isn’t quite his preferred cut – that somehow there exists a wilder, less studio-safe version of the movie out there – absolutely flooring. If Focus Features is fine with, say, bankrolling the moment that Amleth assembles a corpse-composed collage to frighten his uncle, or a late-film scene involving Gudrun and enough incestuous overtones to fill the library of V.C. Andrews, then I am extremely curious what gave them pause. Regardless of what happened between shooting, editing, test-screenings and final delivery, The Northman arrives like something of an instant cult hit, singular and bold. A ferociously committed Skarsgard will awaken all sorts of feelings in the film’s teenage audience (this feels like the actor’s 300 moment), Joy brings a wicked sense of dreamy danger to her unfortunately underwritten role, and Kidman’s frightening turn as a woman more in control of her world than any of the primordial men around her might realize trumps whatever wonky accent she’s attempting to employ. (Let’s also pause for a moment to congratulate Eggers on staging a stealth reunion of Big Little Lies’ Skarsgard and Kidman, who respectfully played abusive husband and terrified wife on that HBO series.) The Northman isn’t the first contemporary Viking movie to push audiences’ endurance levels (Nicolas Winding Refn’s Valhalla Rising is inarguably a tougher sit), but it does feel like the last Viking movie we will need for some time. Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of Yaaaaaarghghghghhgghghghghghh."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"THE NORTHMAN is a wild ride. Its dark, violent, gory and very entertaining."
"Apr 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"At two hours and sixteen minutes, THE NORTHMAN moves quickly. I could not take my eyes off the screen. "
"Apr 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is a ghastly, grisly, ultra violent film that is hard to watch, but also hard to look away from this visually striking take on ancient Viking lore."
"Apr 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"  Alexander Skarsgård cuts a swath of bloody vengeance in a ferocious Viking epic. The Northman vividly combines a Hamlet-esque narrative with Scandinavian history and mythology. The film inserts fantasy elements into its brutal depiction of murder, looting, and pillaging. The Norse gods are invoked and bestow favor on a mighty protagonist. His savage odyssey is an action juggernaut of hacked limbs and torn entrails. The Northman is well-acted, directed, and undeniably thrilling; but suffers from rote predictability through a long runtime.   In the late 9th century, young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) eagerly awaits his father's return from battle. King Aurvandill War-Raven's (Ethan Hawke) ships arrive with chests of looted treasure and chained slaves. Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) warmly greets her conquering husband. His bastard brother, Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang), curses the Fool (Willem Dafoe) who mocks their triumph. But the King is in good humor with a sacred duty.   Aurvandill decides it is time for his beloved son's rite of passage as a man. The ceremony is cut short by treachery. Fjölnir uses the distraction to attack his brother, usurp the throne, and steal his beautiful wife. Fjölnir's deceitful lackey lies about killing Amleth. Years later, a grown Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) attacks a Slavic village with a gang of raiders. He overhears that Fjölnir has fled to Iceland. Amleth disguises himself with the slaves being sold to Fjölnir. A captured witch, the blonde Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), recognizes Amleth as an interloper.   Alexander Skarsgård is a beast and a half here. His ultra-chiseled physique mercilessly decimates enemies by any means. Amleth even bites like an animal. He is bitterly consumed by hatred for his uncle. Biding his time for the right opportunity to strike. Amleth's duplicitous turn as a slave offers a stark contrast to the feral warrior. He's beaten, mocked, and goaded by Fjölnir's foolish men. Arrogance blinds them to the dangerous threat in their midst. These scenes further stoke Amleth's rage for the reckoning to come.   The female supporting cast offers needed character complexity and a welcome diversion from the raging machismo. Women exist to serve the whims of men. Nicole Kidman's Queen Gudrún is more than a concubine passed between brothers. She has the most interesting perspective. Slave women are worked like horses and could be violated at any time. Anya Taylor-Joy's Olga knows she is the most physically attractive slave. She uses her wits to keep defilers at bay. Her cunning becomes a valuable weapon alongside Amleth's brute strength.   Director/co-writer Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) continues to excel in creating engrossing environments. You can almost smell the dirt, blood, and brisk sea air. Eggers' experience as a production designer allows him to be truly immersive. He creates authentic settings that show the primal nature of the characters. Scenes of the Vikings covered in hides and channeling their bear spirits are magnificent. There is no humanity in their lust for violence and carnal pleasures.   The Northman is told in sections of Norse folklore. Amleth's quest is fated by the gods. The film incorporates his visions as cut-scenes from the primary narrative. Amleth sees his family lineage as a luminous tree ascending to the heavens. He also prays to Odin for the will to overcome his suffering. Robert Eggers juxtaposes the grit of battle and servitude with religious imagery. The changes in lighting, surface texture, and depth are superbly done.   The Northman is a spectacularly graphic film. Robert Eggers revels in butchery. The realistic swordplay leaves little to the imagination. Open wounds spurt blood. Skulls are smashed to brain pulp. Heads literally roll. This is not an endeavor for children or anyone remotely squeamish.   Audiences will certainly get their action fix. The Northman gets high marks for looks. I just wish the screenplay was more sophisticated. We've seen the unstoppable killing spree countless times. There's no deviation from the expected.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures."
"Apr 18, 2022",POSITIVE," It’s days like this that remind me of just how little I really know about movies. You see, I’m here to talk about The Northman, the gore-drenched film directed by Robert Eggers concerning the revenge of a Viking prince. As I was turning the movie over in my head, I began wondering, “Are Viking films numerous enough to be considered a genre?” As it turns out, they kind of are! We don’t quite have a time in cinema where Viking films reigned supreme at the box office. While gangster movies were very much a thing in the 1930s to 1940s, and westerns were the dominant genre for close to three decades, Vikings tended to pop their bearded heads up here and there almost at random. And it bears mentioning that there were a lot of different flavors of cinematic Viking. You had the How to Train Your Dragon franchise (Vikings for the whole family). You had Erik the Viking (Vikings by way of Monty Python). You had The Vikings (Old-school Hollywood Vikings). You had The 13th Warrior (Big budget Vikings). You had Valhalla Rising (Sexy Vikings). Hell, you even had the Thor franchise, if you like a little MCU with your Norse mythology. If you dig deep into a specific genre, you’ll eventually find examples of movies that embody the best of that genre. The argument could be made that Die Hard or Hard Boiled are the greatest action movies ever made. Is The Northman the greatest Viking movie ever made? Well…maybe? I know that it’s true to itself and true to an uncompromising style of theatrical film that might be vanishing. For only a short while, Amleth is allowed a childhood. He’s a Viking prince. All he knows is that his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) loves him and that he looks up to his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) as something a little less than a god. That’s solidified when his father returns from a brutal military campaign and the two take part in a psychedelic coming of age ceremony presided over by the shaman Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe). Then, Amleth’s childhood is brought to a bloody end. His uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) resents his brother. He wants it all, the lands, the title, the prestige. So Aurvandill is struck down. Gudrun is carried off. Amleth flees into the wider world, and even as a boy, he makes a blood oath. He swears to avenge his father, save his mother, and smite his uncle. Years pass and the adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) has found a new home. He’s a ravager. We see he’s awfully good at what he does when his clan overruns a village, pitilessly slaughtering the inhabitants and plundering their goods. But he’s never forgotten the oath he swore in childhood, and his heart has grown cold and dark.  When Amleth learns Fjolnir lost his kingdom and lives in a small settlement in Iceland, he sees his chance. He disguises himself as a captured slave. He meets and falls in love with the crafty earth witch Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), He discovers a blade with an unquenchable thirst for blood. He thinks he’s ready. After having seen The Witch and The Lighthouse, I remember wondering what a Robert Eggers film would look like with a serious budget. Now I know, as the budget for The Northman was reportedly in the neighborhood of $90 million. Does this mean Eggers has officially sold out and delivered a four-quadrant adventure designed to entertain the whole family? Oh, no. While The Northman might be considered his most accessible film, it’s several miles away from what most people would consider accessible.* Eggers’ cast understood the assignment and all turn in performances that feel appropriately gritty and legendary. I appreciated that Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga is literally a crafty witch with magical powers. She’s thinking five steps ahead of everyone else, and you get the feeling that had Almeth not hacked everybody to pieces, she would have dispatched them in a far more horrific manner. Alexander Skarsgard isn’t playing a good guy, per se, but he’s trying to do the right thing within the morality of his time. Almeth lives in a world devoid of compassion, where strength and will are the only things respected. He’s a killing machine, and Skarsgard wisely gives us a glimpse beneath Almeth’s scarred surface to show the scared little boy who desperately misses his father. I also liked Willem Dafoe, providing perhaps one minute of necessary comic relief, and Nicole Kidman playing a noble who’s more than she seems. I thought pretty seriously about titling this review The Blood Feast, since that’s kind of what Eggers has made with The Northman. The film is hyper-violent and more than a little full of itself. It’s also the product of a unique vision, and I’m amazed and pleased that a studio invested $90 million to see that vision realized. We need more of that, and The Northman just might be the Vikingiest Viking movie ever made. *He’s the guy that made a puritanical horror show and a movie about isolation and mermaids by way of H.P. Lovecraft. A bunch of dudes swinging swords around feels like it would be easy to get into, until you actually start watching the movie. **Perhaps not the best way to label Almeth. Let’s go with “protagonist” instead.***Yeah, The Northman is basically Hamlet only a) far bloodier and b) the protagonist never thinks about killing himself. Same goes for The Lion King."
"Apr 18, 2022",NEUTRAL," Based on the Norse myth that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Robert Eggers’ third film is a rollocking, rampaging Viking romp. The Northman is Eggers’ most ambitious project to date, but for all its howling spectacle and ultra-violent elemental machismo it is also his least successful. In 9th century Scandinavia, Aurvandil, Raven King of the Jutes (Ethan Hawke) has returned home after a season of warfare, his Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) waiting patiently for him, and his son Amleth, Prince of Jutland, (Oscar Novak) growing quickly. Meanwhile, Aurvandil’s bastard half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) waits in the wings, plotting the Raven King’s betrayal which he performs in spectacular fashion, skewering Aurvandil with spears before lopping off his head. Amleth escapes by the skin of his teeth, fleeing the kingdom. By the time we see him next, he has grown into a raging, howling wolf of a man, pillaging his way across Eastern Europe and plotting his vengeance against Fjölnir. The Northman’s source narrative may have inspired Hamlet but this tale’s natural bedfellow is undoubtedly Macbeth; indeed Eggers’ film is strikingly similar to Justin Kurzel’s visceral 2015 retelling of the Scottish play. And just as the madness of ambition is what inspired the Scottish warrior to overthrow his King, it’s the madness of rage that drives this Danish prince to exact vengeance. The Northman’s opening act is everything we’ve come to expect from the director of The Witch and The Lighthouse: intensely operatic and tonally pitch black. Amleth’s surreal, hallucinogenic coming of age ritual is almost parodic in its ultra masculinity, seeing father and son howl like wolves before drinking a psychedelic soup prepared by Willem Dafoe’s rictus-grinning Heimir the Fool. The first act’s intensity begins at ten and scales up from there, culminating in the adult Amleth raiding a Slavic village with his pack of equally deranged wolf men. It’s a bravura sequence shot in a single take with all the pillaging, hacking, slashing and screaming that a Viking could ask for. Then we’re on to Iceland after Amleth hears that Fjölnir himself has been deposed and is now a sheep farmer. Unfortunately, this is where The Northman begins to falter. The intense momentum of its first half hour is constrained by Amleth finding Fjölnir so early on. When Amleth arrives, having befriended the beautiful Slav witch Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), he vows to torment Fjölnir before finally killing him and freeing his mother. But this leads to something of a slump in the second act where Amleth moodily waits until the time is right to strike (sound familiar?). Olga, too, is sadly underwritten: her motivation to help Amleth after he sacked her village and killed her kinsmen is never really explored and so she ultimately functions as a foil to his quest. And when the narrative does pick up again in third act, it’s undercut by an entirely predictable revelation. It might seem a churlish complaint – after all it’s hardly the myth’s fault that its narrative components should be familiar- but it’s still a shame that the film doesn’t find a more interesting way to present the old tale’s twists and turns. That said, when The Northman does kick in to final gear boy does it go for it. What is most satisfying about the film is its full and non-ironic commitment to a ludicrously operatic masculinity. There is surely no other way to end such a piece than the way it does: atop an erupting volcano, silhouetted naked figures beating the everloving Hel out of each other. It might not be subtle, it might not even be particularly deep, but it sure is spectacular."
"Apr 18, 2022",POSITIVE," At the end of Robert Eggers’ first movie, 2015’s “The Witch,” Anya Taylor-Joy’s character joins an eerie group of witches in the woods and — in a shocking and subversive moment — lifts off into the air, free from gender roles and gravity. Unfortunately, Eggers’ third film, “The Northman,” never reaches its moment of flight. Despite efforts from the Valkyries and Odin’s ravens, this Viking action art piece is fettered to the ground by the demands of the studio gods. In this third effort, Eggers is adapting a Viking tale that inspired “Hamlet,” but he has a bigger budget and bigger names (this is his first departure from indie mainstreamer A24, which produced “The Witch” and 2019’s “The Lighthouse”). With those armaments come more action, blood and guts, and — as Eggers has spoken about in interviews — more input from test audiences and studio execs (Focus Features).  These fit on Eggers’ filmmaking sensibility like a shirt of mail that’s too small. His other two movies are unpredictable and deeply weird. This one feels too foretold. The first part of the movie is the most inspired: Eggers unfolds his mythic version of ninth- century Scandinavia like a Bayeux Tapestry, taking us through it section by section. A Viking king (Ethan Hawke) comes home from war to his wife (Nicole Kidman) and adolescent son, Amleth. Hawke is more than convincing as King Aurvendil, even until his murder at the hands of his brother Fjölnir (Danish actor Claes Bang), who wants the kingdom — and Kidman — for himself.  Amleth escapes with a promise of vengeance, and grows into a fearsome, wolfish ravager played by Alexander Skarsgård (who became famous playing vampire Eric Northman in HBO’s “True Blood,” leading enough people to Google “is ‘The Northman’ about Eric Northman” that it pops up in suggested searches). While Skarsgård sells Amleth’s steely emptiness, he’s at times wooden when showing the animalistic rage the screenplay constantly tells us he feels. When he’s just standing there with nothing to do, he looks like an action figure who’s not being played with.  Skarsgård is a bit old for the role at 45, and it’s hard to forget Kidman, only nine years older, played his wife on HBO’s “Big Little Lies.” But Skarsgård isn’t at all the problem, and Kidman is certainly not. At the end of a second act that begins to sag, she revitalizes the story in a scene that should be in her career highlights reel. Taylor-Joy is back, trading her Puritan garb for the role of a Slavic sorceress, but now she’s hampered by an accent that feels both unplaceable and generic. The script Eggers co-wrote with poet and novelist Sjón is so beautiful at moments that the one or two times when it drops from Eddaic turns of phrase into Hollywood clichés, it’s all the more jarring. While there were moments when my jaw dropped, I didn’t leave the theater wanting to rewatch it anytime soon.  If you want to see a Conan the Barbarian-ish Vikesploitation movie, this one is more immersive but less action-packed than you might want. If you want to see a medieval art film, watch last year’s “The Green Knight.” With Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke. Directed by Robert Eggers, from a screenplay by Eggers and Sjón. 140 minutes. Rated R for strong bloody violence, some sexual content and nudity. Opens April 22 at multiple theaters."
"Apr 18, 2022",NEUTRAL," When it comes to the pivotal events that heralded the beginning of the end of the Second World War in Europe, D-Day quite naturally takes historical centre stage. But it’s often forgotten that the battle for Europe began almost a year earlier, when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Sicily in the summer of 1943. It was a bold and hugely dangerous strategy, not least because invading Sicily – seen as the soft underbelly of Europe – was exactly what Hitler expected the Allies to do. So, somehow, German high command had to be persuaded that the Allies’ objectives lay elsewhere… which is where Operation Mincemeat, the name of a top-secret intelligence plan and the new film it has now inspired, comes in. I’ll leave military historians to argue how important Mincemeat – so-called because of its use of a slowly decaying dead body – actually was, but the star-studded film, which at times seems to have employed just about every character actor on British Equity’s books, is seriously classy. Which is what you’d expect given that it’s directed by John Madden, who made Shakespeare In Love, and has a cast led by Colin Firth, Matthew Macfadyen and Kelly Macdonald. Firth plays Ewen Montagu, informal leader of a small and hastily recruited intelligence cabal who set out to persuade Hitler that the Allied invasion would actually begin in Greece. The film oozes wartime atmosphere, Madden skilfully makes time both for intrigue and romance, and there are even moments of comedy as we watch Johnny Flynn playing Commander Ian Fleming, hatching the idea for the future James Bond as he works. With Jason Isaacs, as Admiral Godfrey, stealing every scene he graces, only a slight dip in energy and an unforeseen shortage of plot in the last lap modestly mar the cinematic occasion. The Lost City feels like a remake of Romancing The Stone or, perhaps more accurately, its sequel The Jewel Of The Nile, only this time it’s Sandra Bullock playing the romantic lady novelist who is kidnapped alongside Channing Tatum as the vain male model who graces her Mills & Boon-style book covers and reluctantly comes to her aid. But along the gently underwhelming way this time around, we discover that Bullock and Tatum have limited screen chemistry, that giving Brad Pitt a distracting cameo seriously unbalances the film, and that any search for long-lost ancient treasure has become seriously old-hat since Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas’s day. The Northman is the latest film from Robert Eggers, maker of both The Witch and The Lighthouse, and has been proclaimed a masterpiece in some quarters. But once again, I can’t quite see what all the excitement is about, as the American director combines a sub-Shakespearean tale of murder and revenge with Viking mythology, shamanistic ritual and a huge amount of bloody Dark Ages violence. Yes, it looks magnificent and Eggers certainly goes all out, but it’s difficult to see much more than muscle and machismo in Alexander Skarsgard’s central performance as Amleth and, at times, the director’s decision to deliver the whole thing in a rich variety of cod-Scandi English is almost comically distracting. Paul Verhoeven will probably always be best known as the director of Basic Instinct and, to a lesser extent, of the much derided Showgirls too. And rightly so, it turns out, with Benedetta duly delivering a more than generous helping of titillating, 1970s-style lesbian nun sex but leavened with sufficiently heavy-going scenes of religious fervour, miraculous resurrection and Charlotte Rampling as a disapproving Mother Superior for the whole thing to be successfully passed off as serious drama."
"Apr 18, 2022",POSITIVE," Not a remake of the 1978 Lee Majors tv movie The Norseman that I’d been hoping for, The Northman turns out to be the third feature by Robert Eggers, and one that’s eagerly awaited by serious cineastes with a taste for the outre. Eggers spawned a breakout hit with The Witch, which was an intense slow-burn that horror audiences seemed to adore, even if it took a long time to get to the expected supernatural conclusion. Occult beliefs also featured in The Lighthouse, in which Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe wrestled with some kind of malignant entity which may have been their own sexuality, mermaids, or both. From there, it was only a matter of time before someone gave him a wodge of cash and encouraged Eggers to express himself on a grand scale. And The Northman is grand; Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, a Viking who seeks to revenge his father when his uncle murders Amleth’s dad and marries Amleth’s mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Wait, what? Doesn’t this sound like the story of Hamlet, who seeks to revenge his father when his uncle murders his dad and marries Hamlet’s mother Gertrude? Of course, Shakespeare didn’t invent the story that Hamlet is based on, and The Northman seeks to trace a literary classic back to its roots in Norse history. So there’s tonnes of elements here that surprise; this Hamlet isn’t a scholar but a ruthless Viking who kills dispassionately as an automatic response to danger. Amleth throws his lot in with a big-cheese sorceress named Olga of the Birch Forest (Aya-Taylor Joy) as he seeks to bust apart the court of Fjolnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) and revenge his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) as he seeks to ‘cut the thread of fate’ that binds them. As the above synopsis describes, The Northman is an all-star fantasy epic, usually the formula for a good/bad movie in the mould of the Conan movies that are a point of inspiration here; you’ve certainly never seen such emphatic beheadings in your puff. But Eggers elevates everything with a steely grasp of narrative, great performances from a game cast, and a series of striking, Bruegel-esque images that shock and surprise. Taking inspiration as much from Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev as from any comic book, Eggers fashions a world of ravens, Valkyries, witches, volcanoes and Bjork as a seer-ess. Skarsgård was born to play this kind of muscle-bound, troubled hero, but Kidman in particular shines as his maternal adversary; she’s been on an upswing in film (Destroyer, Aquaman, Being the Ricardos) and tv (Nine Perfect Strangers, The Undoing, Big Little Lies) that defies the notion that women don’t get many good roles after they pass 50. Eggers is a major, visionary talent, and even if his film doesn’t have the obvious commercial appeal of some other more user-friendly epics, it’s a beautiful, compelling and often fascinating film that tells a familiar story in an original way; The Northman is a mighty, nasty-ass epic of treachery, pagan horror and bloody revenge. No excuses will be accepted; seeing The Northman early, and in cinemas, is the only sensible option for those who love their films dark and dangeous…. What about those who prefer their movies light and fluffy? Does the main character at any point breakout into a song that is easily remembered and sung by children? I’m sure I’ll see this, though Vikings don’t much interest me. I seem to remember Valhalla Rising being a disappointment a while back. Also Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman strike me as having very, very modern faces and I have trouble imagining them being convincing in this setting. I like how Valhalla set out, but it got a bit lost in the mists as it went on. But that’s a good jumping off point for this, which is certainly a strong evocation of a culture that’s rarely worked in cinema. The all-star cast seemed potentially hokey to me, but Hawke and Kidman are both terrific in this; the atmosphere is so strong that you never question them at all. I wasn’t enthused going in, but The Northman is a good as everyone and their dog says it is. Look, it’s not my job to get into these pictures and cheer people up. These are publicity pictures, I don’t get to dictate the expressions on their faces. Nope, you should RAISE your expectations. You liked things about The Witch and The Lighthouse; I think this is a fuller film than both of these. prepare to be impressed. I made up that care Bears vs Smurfs film to try and please Booky, you know how it is, but sadly no such film exists. Sorry. No one can glower like Sonic. JCVD has a bit of a glower on as well. But look at how happy the faces are in Dog! No glowers there. It’ll be soon released in France (early days of May) and I can’t wait to go. The spirit of Conan seems very close and I like it. May Odin walk with that Northman.
Thanx for the review. I think you’ll dig this big time, and I’m looking forward to seeing it again; A25 style horror and mysticism yoked to a Conan-level fantasy adventure; what’s not to like? Nope. Found it shallow and derivative and with occult notions beyond any sense. Your hero is hung from the rafters and somehow someone – not necessarily the hero who doesn’t appear to have occult powers – can call on ravens to peck away at the rope to free him. Oh, and someone just handily discarded a sword in the vicinity.  Oh, and he can’t kill said father until the moon is green or similar tosh so the movie just goes on and on.  No idea how this cost $90 million – it’s not on the screen – at best a top-of-the-range direct-to-video blood-and-slaughter picture. I liked The Witch but a bigger budget has not done him any favours and I always wince when someone is described as a “visionary director.” This demo site is only for demonstration purposes.

"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"300 meets Midsommar, and probably the most realistic Viking movie to date. Part ancient myth, part Shakespeare, part History Channel. This might not be a ""fun"" movie but it's a visceral experience worthy of the big screen - and your time."
"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE," There was some concern when director Robert Eggers seemed to allude to his third feature (and first with a studio-sized budget) being subjected to interference in post-production, although he did stress shortly afterwards that the version of The Northman to hit theaters would be the unadulterated product of his own distinctive vision. As it turns out, the filmmaker wasn’t lying, because the brutally intense, bludgeoning, and altogether blistering Viking epic is unquestionably the work of an auteur who knew exactly what they wanted to bring to the screen, and delivered it in the most uncompromising fashion possible. Much like The Witch and The Lighthouse, The Northman touches base with several of Eggers’ favored themes, including the reframing of familiar mythology or folklore in a different light, characters haunted by uncertainty and self-doubt, and a protagonist conflicted by their own motivations, except this time it’s painted on a canvas almost six times as expensive as his previous two movies combined, and it shows. The Northman isn’t particularly concerned or encumbered by narrative, though, and you’ll even be familiar with the broadest strokes of the story given that Eggers and co-writer Sjón adapted it from the same Danish legend that would go on to inspire William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, but the “why” and “how” is eminently more important to the function and enjoyment of the film than the “what” and “when”. Not wasting any time, we dive right into a first act that moves along at a clip, and instantly immerses us in the weirdness that becomes a huge part of The Northman‘s unique charm. Ethan Hawke’s King Aurvandil returns from war, and decides that now is the time for young Prince Amleth to begin the journey from boy to man. To do this, the monarchic father and son literally go feral, transforming themselves into the embodiment of beasts to break themselves down to their most primal forms, with Willem Dafoe’s Heimir the Fool acting as master of ceremonies. It’s jarring, slightly uncomfortable, and very strange indeed, but as The Northman progresses, it ends up informing the entirety of Amleth’s story right until the final frame. As soon as Aurvandil and his heir emerge in the open, Claes Bang’s Fjölnir seizes his moment to strike, staging a bloody coup by lopping off his brother’s head and claiming the kingdom for himself. Fortunately, Amleth manages to escape to safety and swears an oath of revenge, which turns out to be quite the understatement. Alexander Skarsgård recently lamented that he didn’t want to be typecast as a sex symbol at the beginning of his career, but he’s now a Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe-winning actor, so that ship has long since sailed. However, he’s never played a role anything close to the adult Amleth before. Approaching his performance in a manner that deftly straddles the line between man and beast, Skarsgård cuts an imposing figure that lurches forward with his shoulders hunched, which is designed to do much more than show off those awe-inspiring trapezius muscles. Amleth comes across as a man possessed in more ways than one, constantly fighting to subdue his animalistic nature and unbridled ferocity, which isn’t 100% successful by any stretch given the bodies strewn in his wake. It’s not just the Skarsgård show, it should be said, with the cast uniformly excellent across the board. Hawke brings gravely gravitas to the table that would make anyone want to seek retribution in his name, while Dafoe goes full Dafoe as the bug-eyed, scene-stealing Heimir. That’s really the only “big” performance among the ensemble (although Björk’s bewitchingly captivating seer may fall into that category for some), but every primary character has many dimensions. Bang’s Fjölnir may be the erstwhile villain of the piece, but he’s not a boo-hiss baddie. Sure, he usurped his brother’s throne after decapitating him and stole his wife, but it didn’t work out all that well in the long run, and that’s before Amleth reappears on the scene. He’s trying to do his best and what he believes is right with the hand he dealt himself, matters that aren’t helped by an utterly chaotic (in the most complimentary way) Nicole Kidman, who deliberately has you questioning her intentions, motivations, and truths every time she opens her mouth as Queen Gudrún. Anya Taylor-Joy’s sorceress Olga of the Birch Forest is the relatively calm counterpoint that brings balance to the furious, conflicted, and eventually skeptical Amleth, even if she points out that while he can break bodies with ease, only she is capable of breaking minds. There’s an air of “seen it all before destiny” when it comes to their dynamic and ultimate destination, but the pair are far too good to let it come anywhere close to approaching formula. While some of the marketing may have been somewhat misleading in painting The Northman as a battle-heavy actioner, the set pieces are regularly jaw-dropping in their own right. Eggers favors long takes that display incredible technical precision and shot composition, while cinematographer Jarin Blaschke presents crisp, clean, visuals that ensure not a single frame is wasted, and that’s without even mentioning the startling color schemes, sweeping landscape shots, and expertly-paced choreography (complemented by an ever-evolving score from Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough) that gives each distinct shift of location or new blood-soaked scrap an entirely different dimension. Amleth’s fate is literally signposted word-for-word in the opening voiceover, but Eggers ensures that you’ll be fully invested in the journey, despite being spoon fed the steps right from the off. The Northman might be a fairly standard A-to-B saga of revenge on paper, but every corner of all 137 minutes boasts style, action, blood, love, lust, death, expressiveness, insularity, and spectacle to spare, so you’ll never be left wanting from scene to scene. To be fair, it might not be for everyone, but you’ll know within the first five minutes or so whether you’re willing to throw your lot in with an occasionally hallucinogenic, often gruesomely violent, and intensely raw slice of historical mysticism that goes all-in to the extent that the climactic showdown revolves around two naked buff dudes duking it out with swords on top of a mountain in the midst of a volcanic eruption. The Northman is wild, startling, fascinating, and phenomenal at once, but hopefully it’s just the beginning of Eggers regularly being handed sizeable budgets to deliver more sprawling near-masterpieces."
"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE," With just two films, The Witch and The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers has established himself as one of America’s must-see auteurs. The Northman, a US$70 million Viking movie, will probably further his reputation as an ambitious filmmaker keen to get his vision on the screen whatever the cost. A resourceful, brave child, he barely escapes with his life, having slit the nose of one assailant. Sailing away, he yells over and over: “I will avenge you father, I will save you mother. I will kill you Fjölnir.” Years later, as the story lurches into the early 10th century, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) still harbours feelings of vengeance, plotting to kill Fjölnir and retrieve his mother (Nicole Kidman), who is now by his murderous uncle’s side. He arrives in Iceland as an unknown, where he meets the resourceful Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who seems determined to help him see his plan through. Howling and screaming with rage, Skarsgard gives body and soul to his performance, as a man on his life’s mission. “Hate is all I have ever known,” he says, a feeling that is only going to grow as revelations drop. Scripted by Eggers and Sjón, the Icelandic writer who also co-wrote the recent movie fable Lamb, the film pays great attention to Viking rituals and beliefs. Eggers truly understands how to spirit his audience back a thousand years, although The Northman is a more conventional narrative experience than, say, The Lighthouse or even Nicolas Winding Refn’s own Viking film, 2009’s Valhalla Rising. Still, Eggers is to be congratulated for smuggling something so primal past studio heads. In this age of superhero saturation, The Northman feels like a real Hollywood rarity."
"Apr 17, 2022",NEUTRAL," The American director Robert Eggers established himself as a singular cinematic voice with the chilling 17th-century “New England Folktale” The Witch, and followed it up with The Lighthouse, an immersive dream of mermaids and murder. Both movies had an atmosphere you could taste, and made virtues of their relatively low budgets, conjuring expansive worlds from meagre resources. Enter The Northman, a Viking epic, its budget reportedly in excess of $70m, that comes on like a head-smashing mashup of Beowulf, Hamlet (Eggers and Shakespeare share a Scandinavian legend source) and Nicolas Winding Refn’s Valhalla Rising, told in growly tones that are more Dark Knight than Green Knight. Co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón, and described by Eggers as an attempt to make “the definitive Viking movie”, it’s as ambitious as it is preposterous and, at times, ponderous – filled with garbled epithets about vengeance and fate that are whispered, muttered, or blood-curdlingly yelled. This is a story of children “born of savagery”, in which tormented men spurn happiness to dive into icy waters in search of a fight, while mothers-to-be howl like banshees at the gods; a story with chapters that take place “Years Later”, and that lead us to “The Gates of Hell”. Understatement is not on the menu. We open in the Orkney/Shetland-adjacent fictional kingdom of Hrafnsey in AD895, Here, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) in front of his young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), who then witnesses his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), being carried off screaming. “I will avenge you father; I will save you mother; I will kill you Fjölnir!” becomes the battle cry of Amleth, who grows up to become an iron-hearted berserker, played with muscular vulnerability by Alexander Skarsgård, in the land of Rus. An impressive extended shot (one of many) tracks an intoxicated raid on a Slavic village, delivering axes in heads (characters in The Northman are identified by missing parts of their faces) as poultry flap in the background amid Pythonesque mud. An encounter with a visionary seeress (an elaborately headdressed Björk) sets Amleth on a roundabout course to Iceland, branding himself a slave in order to infiltrate his uncle’s circle. On arrival, he headbutts a man to a pulp while playing a sport that looks like a cross between quidditch and rollerball, thereby winning the approval of his estranged mother, who is now living with Fjölnir. It’s an arrangement she seems to enjoy, although Amleth knows she’s just acting – and there’s a lot of acting in The Northman: some pouty, some scowly, some beefy, some shouty – all delivered in the film’s occasionally ridiculous Nordic-sounding English language (shades of The Last Duel’s accent salads). Amleth also acquires an Arthurian-style blade that can only be unsheathed under foretold circumstances, and teams up with Olga (The Witch’s breakout star, Anya Taylor-Joy), who tells him: “Your strength breaks men’s bones. I have the cunning to break their minds.” Eggers has always had an astute eye for that strange crossover between this world and the next, mixing earthy tactility with otherworldly dreams in impressively matter-of-fact fashion. That quality is to the fore in The Northman, which at times reminded me of the living comic-book aesthetic of Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s Sin City, not least when the monochrome noir of night-time exteriors is broken by the golden glow of firelit interiors – a key motif. Yet for all its visual coups (breathtaking scenery, evocatively captured by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke) and multilayered soundtrack (composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough place us right there in the landscape), there’s something oddly plodding about Amleth’s bloody mission. While the Norns-of-fate narrative may contrive several reversals of fortune and sympathy, there’s little of the genuinely uncanny weirdness that made Eggers’s first two features such a treat. What madness lies herein is not of the north-northwest variety but more in keeping with the bonkers blockbuster spectacle of Darren Aronofsky’s Noah. In last week’s Observer, Eggers spoke of the pressure to deliver “the most entertaining Robert Eggers movie I could make”. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the result feels uncharacteristically familiar as it marauds toward a final act pitched somewhere between Conan the Barbarian and Anakin’s last moments from Revenge of the Sith, with just a hint of the manly fireside wrestling of Women in Love. The end result could happily play on a double bill with either Zardoz or Thor. Whether that will prove a strength or a weakness with the all-important multiplex audiences remains to be seen."
"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE," I don’t consider myself a particularly macho man. I’m more at home with a book than a beer in my hand and I hate the thought of confrontation so much that I could barely even watch that Will Smith moment at the Oscars. But The Northman made me want to tear off my shirt, let out a Viking roar and run into battle waving a sword above my head. Whether I could even lift the thing remains to be seen. The movie is a bloody, muddy revenge saga, steeped in Northern European folklore and directed by Robert Eggers, determined to outdo the wildness of his previous movies – no mean feat given those films are The Witch and The Lighthouse. Eggers here takes the helm of a film which, even as you’re watching it, seems so unlikely to have come through Hollywood that you can’t quite believe it’s real. An early scene features a mostly naked Ethan Hawke and his young son crawling on all fours and barking like dogs – as well as farting like men – in a fire-lit cave while Willem Dafoe yells at them in terrifying close-up. It’s not exactly Horrible Histories. Eggers has teamed up with Icelandic poet Sjón to pen the script, based on the same folkloric tale that inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet. Or it inspired Disney to make The Lion King, depending on your preference. Alexander Skarsgård is Amleth, who vows revenge as a child when his father (Hawke) is murdered by his own brother – the treacherous Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Fjölnir takes Amleth’s mother (Nicole Kidman) as his own bride and Amleth flees in order to evade his own death, eventually returning to his kingdom as a slave alongside young sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). It’s narratively a fairly simple piece of work, but Eggers imbues each frame with gargantuan scale. He directs like a man who has been given $90m to make his ridiculous Viking movie and frankly can’t believe his luck. One scene in which the camera tracks almost unbearably slowly through a violent assault in a village is a heart-stopping, virtuoso bit of filmmaking from a director at the top of his powers. Eggers is fond of framing his characters as tiny figures at the bottom of frame, dwarfed by the majesty of the scenery around them and resigned to their position in the tapestry of fate. It’s a film in which magic is always present, but it’s the wits and actions of humanity which drive the story to its inevitable, violent conclusion – a naked volcano sword fight, naturally. The film exists in a constant state of macho intensity, powered forward by Skarsgård’s guttural roars and rippling abs which alternately glisten with either sweat or blood depending on the scene. It’s a performance of immense physical commitment, but backed up by palpable emotional pain beneath the swinging sword and promises of bloodshed – a sickness of revenge from which he can’t escape. Amleth is as vulnerable as he is violent and scenes between Skarsgård and Taylor-Joy have a tenderness and affection to them which sit deliberately awkwardly on Amleth’s face. He abandoned his humanity as a child and simply doesn’t know how to love. As with all of Eggers previous work, the tone exists in a state of unpredictable madness, capable of lurching from post-coital forest chats to subterranean encounters with magical beings. The oppressive feel is maintained by the all-consuming, distorted thrum of Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s score – a gnarly, assaultive soundscape which keys the audience in to the orchestra of vengeance polluting Amleth’s brain and guiding his anger inexorably home to face his father’s killer.  While it’s a movie driven by its forceful, vicious energy, the performances find nuance beyond the basic trappings of the story. Kidman, in particular, is given layers well beyond the initially thin character she appears to be and Bang proves to be a terrifying, ruthless adversary. Taylor-Joy’s performance, though, really shines through as a beguiling sorceress who unlocks a future for Amleth beyond his quest for bloody retribution. “Your strength breaks men’s bones,” she tells Amleth as she encourages him to bide his time, adding “I have the cunning to break their minds”. The Northman, with its vicious blend of blood and ice, feels like the crowning achievement for one of the most idiosyncratic and unique filmmakers working in Hollywood today. It’s a work which is almost defiantly non-commercial, boasting a core of rigorous historical research that mingles with delightful lashings of folkloric wonder. And as much as it’s a stimulating and emotionally potent movie, there’s a lot to be said for its simple, primal effectiveness. I left the screening fired up, invigorated and with blood pumping through my veins. If that’s not precisely what cinema is about, then I don’t know what is.

"Apr 17, 2022",POSITIVE," Después de que Robert Eggers nos regalara un brillante filme de terror que yuxtapone fe y raciocinio en “The Witch”, así como a Robert Pattinson teniendo sexo con una sirena en la enloquecedora exploración de masculinidad tóxica “The Lighthouse”, parece casi un milagro que un estudio poderoso como Universal Pictures le haya dado 90 millones de dólares para dirigir “El hombre del Norte” (The Northman), un brutal thriller de venganza vikinga que a pesar del enorme presupuesto y de haber encontrado cierta resistencia por parte del estudio, conserva el corazón independiente y la visión casi íntegra de uno de los directores más emocionantes y creativos de la industria. Basada en la leyenda nórdica que inspiró “Hamlet” de Shakespeare, “El hombre del Norte” nos cuenta la historia de Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), un príncipe vikingo que busca venganza por el asesinato de su padre, el rey Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), a manos de su tío Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Amleth presenció este hecho cuando era joven (Oscar Novak) y años después, se ha convertido en un guerrero frenético y sediento de sangre, listo para cumplir con su destino: vengar a su padre y rescatar a su madre (Nicole Kidman). Cualquier duda sobre el compromiso de Eggers por mantener su esencia queda disipada en los primeros 15 minutos cuando ves a un enloquecido Willem Dafoe saltando alrededor de un fuego ceremonial mientras Ethan Hawke y el joven Oscar Novak se arrastran y ladran como perros enfurecidos, dando pie a la visión de reyes muertos colgando del árbol familiar. Es a través de esta secuencia que Amleth aprende a acoger su salvajismo, cualidad que le servirá más tarde al emprender una misión tan simple como feral y primitiva: venganza. Eggers va más allá de una simple interpretación histórica, pues se rodeó de consultores e historiadores para construir una atmósfera vikinga auténtica que además de recrear lugares y vestimentas de la época, también busca plasmar la moralidad y perspectiva vikinga; sus comportamientos, creencias y rituales. Y exquisitamente conectado a este aspecto histórico encontramos, como ya es costumbre en la filmografía de Eggers, un juego con elementos de fantasía que, en este caso, empatan con las creencias de los personajes relacionadas al destino, valquirias y profecías.  Y dentro de todo este mundo, gozamos memorables momentos de violencia visceral que te harán querer rugir desde tu asiento. Tenemos el sanguinario asalto a un pueblo en donde la cámara de Jarin Blaschke sigue a Amleth y su clan metódicamente arrasando con una aldea; un asombroso tracking shot le inyecta energía a esta masacre, silenciosamente plasmando la sed de sangre de los perpetradores. Y el resto de escenas de acción, desde un brutal juego de Knattleikr (una especie de rugby vikingo) hasta una pelea en lo alto de un volcán, mantienen la adrenalina a tope gracias a la implacable y precisa dirección de Eggers, quien se asegura de que sientas en tus huesos la ira detrás de cada golpe y decapitación. El palpitante score de Robin Carolan y Sebastian Gainsborough agrega una capa extra de epicidad al asunto. Toda esta violencia va de la mano con la misión del filme de representar fielmente la cultura vikinga. El amor por la guerra, el deshonor de morir en casa lejos del campo de batalla, el dominio brutal del oponente: estos elementos forman parte intrínseca del desarrollo de Amleth, mismo que con el paso de las escenas nos hace cuestionarnos sobre la finalidad de su cruzada por extraer venganza. Estamos en un mundo en donde la vulnerabilidad masculina debe ser escondida o hasta reemplazada por odio, sentimiento que, como Eggers nos deja ver, solo cosecha más odio. Y es que, en el fondo, Amleth es un hombre forcejeando con el trauma de su niñez, pero debido a la cultura que lo moldeó, solo sabe lidiar con ello de una sola manera: violencia. Es así que cuando se le presenta la oportunidad de sanar, es incapaz de tomarla. Skarsgård (“Claroscuro”) plasma estos matices en una actuación sobresaliente: así como utiliza su imponente fisicalidad para proyectar el lado más feral de Amleth, también exhibe una ira contenida que debe moldear para engañar a su víctima. Eggers y su coguionista, el poeta y novelista Sjón, se encargan de darle una dimensión emocional al personaje de Amleth con apoyo de la figura de Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), una esclava que se convierte en pareja del guerrero. Sin embargo, a pesar de la buena actuación de Taylor-Joy (“El misterio de Soho”), el personaje y subtrama de Olga se quedan cortas con respecto a la del protagonista, pues su rol y por extensión el de la mujer en la cultura vikinga es explorado de manera superficial. Aunque “El hombre del Norte” es el filme más accesible de Eggers a la fecha, nunca sacrifica visión por espectáculo barato: cada hachazo, cabezazo y alucinación tiene una razón de existir dentro de esta narrativa, dando como resultado una justificada explosión de testosterona que funge como un visceral y audiovisualmente asombroso estudio psicológico de la figura del héroe macho tóxico, así como la influencia del entorno en el mismo. Es también un motivo de celebración, pues no es fácil encontrar una película tan costosa de estudio con tanta ambición artística. Esperemos que los números de taquilla apoyen tal apuesta.

"Apr 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"Brutally violent but artistically stunning, The Northman brings harsh realism and dreamy mythology to this Viking story that inspired William Shakespeare's Hamlet ... The end result is an immersive cinematic experience that is both menacing and magical."
"Apr 16, 2022",POSITIVE," You know exactly what The Northman is. It’s a revenge story — a tale as old as time, the simple plot revolving around a once future prince, exiled as a boy after his father, the King, is murdered by his uncle, who returns as a man, hardened and blood-curdling for vengeance. What sets The Northman apart from every other movie that’s ever been made with similar themes is that the plot doesn’t even matter. The Northman is writer/director Robert Eggers’ cinematic exorcism, a film meant to chill you to your marrow, haunt your dreams, clench your fist, and boil your blood. It is two hours and fifteen minutes of violent, animalistic ritual, a testosterone-fueled orgy of masculinity, a film so dark, dirty, raw, and hardcore it makes The Revenant look like Jane Austen. In his first two films, The Witch and The Lighthouse, we were introduced to writer/director Robert Eggers’ vision, one that is dark and raw, violent and naturalistic. They were each groundbreaking cinematic experiences, demonstrating a filmmaker with a bold, visceral style that is shocking and masterful. Well, as it turns out, he was just warming up. Who knows if The Northman is Eggers’ masterpiece, we have no idea what’s still to come from a director still so early into his career. Still, it’s hard to imagine anything more extreme or more in line with his own particular aesthetic than this film, which plays like a monumental death rattle. It is the year 895, and Alexander Skarsgård plays Scandinavian Prince Amleth, the exiled son of King Aurvandil War-Raven, played by Ethan Hawke, who is murdered by his ambitious brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). When Amleth discovers that Fjölnir had himself later been dethroned and is also exiled, Amleth travels to remote Iceland, where Fjölnir serves as chieftain over a small sheep-herding village. Amleth blends in with the new batch of slaves that Fjölnir has ordered, intent on finally following through on his life-long promise to avenge his father’s death by killing his uncle. But things get slightly complicated for Amleth when he finds out his mother, Queen Gudrún, played by Nicole Kidman, is also on the island. He also finds himself attracted to a rebellious slave, Olga of the Birch Forest, played by Anya Taylor-Joy. The story is based on the same ancient Norse legend that inspired William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, so it’s not surprising that it is bold, violent, and larger-than-life. But Eggers, who co-wrote The Northman with Icelandic author Sjón, finds ways to even out-do Shakespeare in the twisted and vengeful department. Amleth is so driven by his thirst for vengeance that he carves his entire life out of violence. As a man, he is far from the pampered prince that he was as a child; as the adult Amleth is savage and animalistic, giving into the witchcraft and sorcery that his father first introduced him to, but Amleth has moved far from an acceptance of mythology to a whole-bodied immersion, following the guidance of witches he meets in his visions, who offer him direction as to how to fulfill his prophecy. If it sounds like an awful lot, it is. It’s actually too much. There are so many scenes filled with half-nude men channeling their inner wolf while crawling on all fours around a giant bonfire that I thought I was at Burning Man. So much of the film is devoted to our understanding of how far Amleth has fallen down into his own rabbit hole and literally beats the drum so loudly and so often that it almost becomes comical how much testosterone is flowing through every scene. There most certainly is an audience for a film like this, which is wall-to-wall rampaging, mud-crawling, blood-drinking, savage gore, but, for the rest of us, we are just begging for a let-up in the chest-thumping and primal screaming, if for nothing else than to take a deep breath. Suppose you think the presence of Kidman and Taylor-Joy softens the narrative by bringing much-needed feminine energy to the screen. In that case, the effect is the opposite, as their characters embolden Amleth’s rage, particularly Kidman’s Queen, a mother who lost her motherly instincts—and her sanity—many years earlier. Kidman is absolutely spectacular in the few scenes she has, exploding with an intensity we haven’t seen before. The casting of Kidman and Taylor-Joy is inspired. Two actresses who come off as if they are as delicate as china but, in The Northman, are each fiery and iron-strong, rebellious, and more than equal to their male counterparts. While, admittedly, Taylor-Joy’s character doesn’t serve much more of a purpose than to bring out Amleth’s long-buried humanity, she does find a way to make the most of it. The rest of the cast is excellent, especially Gustav Lindh, who plays Amleth’s menacing half-brother, Bang, whose Fjölnir is complex and strong, and Björk, who is perfectly cast as a witch who foretells Amleth’s fate. But let’s not kid ourselves when we talk about the performance at the center of The Northman.  Skarsgård’s commitment to this role is evident in every scene, as he completely becomes this character, driven by rage, sharpened by battle, tortured by visions. It is one of the most physical and physically demanding roles you will ever see, and Skarsgård is more than up to the task, transforming entirely into his character and going to every dark place the script demands. If Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar for the physical demands of The Revenant, then Skarsgård deserves the same consideration. His performance is even more compelling because it’s done with very little dialogue. All of his emotions are carried on his face, in his feral screams and grunts, and in his bloodied and taut body. It is a complete dedication to his craft that does not go unnoticed. But all of this–the acting, the story, the mythology, even the absolutely gorgeous landscapes, shot entirely on location in Northern Ireland, serving as a stand-in for Iceland–is merely the appetizer to what The Northman truly feasts on. What sets The Northman apart is how it looks, sounds, and makes you feel. To say the experience is a visceral one is not doing it justice. From the beating, pounding, nerve-jangling music by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough to the weathered and detailed costumes by Linda Muir that are so effective you can almost smell them, to the production design by Craig Lathrop and the editing by Louise Ford, every single production element is absolutely first-rate. But it is in Eggers’ visual style, as photographed by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, that The Northman resonates and truly stamps itself on the psyche. The film’s colors and use of light are bleakly evocative, as the manipulation of varying levels of darkness is staggering. Most of the scenes in the movie are lit only by the glow of fire, a remarkable achievement and highly effective. While there are so many memorable moments and locations, the climactic scene the whole film has been building towards delivers with ferocious and gorgeous intensity, breathtaking and jaw-dropping in its elegant brutality, making the entire journey worth it. The only way to truly experience this film the way it should be is in a movie theater, one with no ambient light and the best projection possible. The Northman is a genuine feast for the senses. Although Robert Eggers’s filmmaking style is definitely an acquired taste and The Northman may be too heavy for some—for most, I imagine–it is absolutely impossible to dismiss the level of difficulty and the artistry at work in this film. At its most compelling, this is visceral filmmaking, and even if it doesn’t engage you, it will impress you. And if you do happen to like over-the-top, violent, testosterone-driven revenge stories with an explosive and ferocious central performance that’s just gravy."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Even with more traditional plotting, writer/director Robert Eggers is far more interested in having viewers swept up in the atmosphere while putting his characters through physical and emotional journeys. The Northman plays like a metal version of Hamlet, complete with extreme violence, wild forms of magic, and fights amid epic backdrops. As a revenge tale set during Viking times, it delivers visceral thrills. Coming as a follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse, this $90 million effort packs all of that budget on screen while still holding onto the off-the-wall qualities that make Eggers a standout genre filmmaker. Alexander Skarsgård stars as Amleth, the inspiration for Shakespeare’s famous Dane. As a child, Amleth watched his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), get beheaded by his treacherous uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Vowing revenge, as a hulking adult, Amleth now finds himself posing as a slave to get closer to his uncle. He has an eye on taking revenge on all involved with the grim fate that met his family. A lot of praise should go to Skarsgård, who somehow enhanced his frame even more than during his time spent as Tarzan. It’s not just his size, however. Sure, shots of Amleth catching spears being hurled at him, only to throw them back at his attackers, are pretty fantastic. Still, it’s the way Amleth conducts himself. When not in battle, the way Skarsgård modulates his body to appear hunched yet massive, complete with his steely conviction, makes him a force. Playing down his intentions, whether to convey this slave identity or relate to another enslaved person, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who caught his eye, allows further nuance. These details provide layers to what is a straightforward revenge story. There’s little innovation in the plot itself, but that’s not a flaw in what’s taking place. For one thing, revenge stories occur so frequently because they are compelling. Regardless, what Eggers achieves so successfully is a mood. Building this Viking world allows the viewers to quickly accept the level of brutality that will frequently come during the film’s 137-minute runtime. Along with that, the use of mysticism informs the state of mind many of these characters are in. Despite a tendency toward minimalism in character design, hearing Fjölnir question how the gods are treating him, as Amleth delivers various forms of retribution, helps pull the viewer into different points of view. Most intriguing is the presence of Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún, Amleth’s mother. She survived the whole ordeal involving her murdered husband. But what is driving her now, and what are her reactions to eventually learning her first son is still alive? While The Northman is not exactly the film to use as a case for feminism or much else beyond white male aggression, both Kidman and Taylor-Joy are written as characters more complicated than simply women under the control of powerful men. Even as the story surrounding them delivers a more traditional path for where their characters go, their certitude allows them to leave more of an impact on Amleth and others. Also, Björk shows up as some kind of blind prophet with wild costume design, so there’s that as well. Getting back to the spectacle on display, I’m aware there’s been talk about the film’s budget and Eggers’ options should this film prove successful. It’s upsetting to know a creative filmmaking voice who continues to prove himself is also the one who must struggle to get other projects off the ground, but that’s where we are in this IP-driven Hollywood landscape. That being said, The Northman does show what Eggers is capable of at this higher budget level while also producing a film that should have a more general appeal than, say, The Lighthouse. Of course, that’s partly by design. A hulking Alexander Skarsgård having all-natural sword fights by an exploding volcano is the kind of thing that should bring in a wide audience. I placed The Green Knight high on my top ten for 2021, and while that film and The Northman share some qualities, Eggers is fully capitalizing on the action sensibilities afforded to him, as opposed to the more contemplative nature of David Lowery’s remarkable film. So yes, this may be Eggers’ most accessible film yet, but what a sight to behold! Having filmed in Northern Ireland, Iceland, and even on a glacier for one scene, the money is entirely on the screen, and the film looks gorgeous. Stepping up to Focus Features from A24 allows a filmmaker to go bigger. That leads to acquiring a filmmaking team that could match the scope required to make The Northman feel as big as it is. Jarin Blaschke’s excellent cinematography is complemented by incredible production and sound design. Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s score tears through the film in all the right ways, given the emotional spectrum the characters are placed on. So much of what we see and hear plays to the movie’s advantage, yet one wonders if there were even more ways to either truncate certain elements or further expand on them to form an even grander epic. Given Eggers’ penchant for research and authenticity, it’s one thing to find plenty of towering (white, blonde) performers using ol’ Scandinavian accents. It could be something else to take us further down the rabbit hole when explaining Valhalla, the Gates of Hel, and more. Not that The Northman is without details and lore, but I enjoyed so much of what I saw that offering the chance to achieve more profundity would have been welcome. Still, it’s not like I was not plenty satisfied with seeing an action-packed Viking story of this caliber. Even in its efforts to take a tale of vengeance and push it to the length it is at while only adding so much depth, I was always excited by what was being presented. Plus, between a nighttime dual with a spirit and images of Valkyries setting off into the distance, there’s a scope complimented well by all of the featured talent. Eggers may enjoy creating an arduous journey for all involved to go on in realizing his visions, but The Northman is another one of his features that swings its blade hard and connects."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Director Robert Eggers' blood-soaked Viking epic is equal parts brutal and breathtaking, a truly immersive cinematic experience that makes the almost-140-minute runtime pass in the blink of an eye. The film, which was largely shot in Ireland - the rugged northern coastline effortlessly standing in for the monumental landscapes of Iceland - is one of the wildest and strangest big-budget action movies coming to the big screen in recent memory, seamlessly interweaving trippy mystical and supernatural elements with scenes of savage violence. This is Eggers' third feature following his critically acclaimed films The Witch and The Lighthouse and sees the American director team up with Icelandic poet Sjón to bring the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, to life. The saga begins at the turn of the 10th century as a young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnesses his father King Aurvandil's (Ethan Hawke) vicious murder at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Fjölnir kidnaps Amleth's mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), leaving a devastated Amleth no choice but to flee his kingdom, vowing to return one day to avenge his father's death and free his mother. The scene is captured in an extraordinary single shot that shows the raw brutality of the times while encapsulating Skarsgard's vigorous dedication to the role. After finding out his uncle is now a feudal lord in Iceland, he travels there on a slave ship to carry out his vengeance alongside Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), an enslaved Slavic woman with powers of sorcery. Although it follows a fairly predictable narrative loop, The Northman succeeds in keeping you spellbound with its rigorous attention to detail, supremely dedicated performances and technically awe-inspiring cinematography. © RTÉ 2024.

"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," But similarities end there, and if you wince occasionally at the violence in The Lighthouse, which includes being buried alive, attacks by a deranged supernatural seagull and drunken fight scenes between lighthouse keeper Willem Dafoe and his assistant Robert Pattinson, then The Northman may leave you reeling from the relentlessness of its Viking slaughter. Raping and pillaging, decapitated men and horses, bitten-off noses, a man lurching into a hut holding his own entrails as they spill out: it’s all there on a massive scale, along with some dodgy accents (there’s Northern Irish or Scottish in there as well as a mysterious, often unintelligible Old Norse brew). It’s rather ripe for parodying, though you can’t deny the film’s power and scale as well as the beauty and strangeness of the landscape, in turn green and lush and black and icy (in fact Northern Ireland was a stand-in, Game of Thrones-style, for Iceland, due to Covid). And Eggers’s famously meticulous attention to period detail and authenticity is apparent in the Viking linens, tapestries, shields, jewellery and carvings. Even the score, by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, uses obscure Viking instruments. And there are wonderfully strange moments, such as Björk’s unforgettable turn – her first film role since Dancer in The Dark (2000) - as a blind Slav seer, covered in beads and with cowrie shells over her eyes, wearing a fantastic headdress of barley sheaves. Her collaborator, Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, is Eggers’s co-writer on the movie. The saga begins in AD 895 and is a reworking of the Hamlet story, with Alexander Skarsgård as Viking prince Amleth (pictured above), enormous muscles bulging, and usually bleeding, beneath arm bracelets. In the first scenes he is still a happy child (played by Oscar Novak) whose father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) has just returned from battle to his fictional kingdom of Hrafnsey, somewhere near the Orkneys. To prepare Amleth for his eventual succession to the throne, they undergo a ritual together in an underground cave, on all fours like wolves, farting and belching and roaring. They lap something hallucinogenic from bowls, presided over by a court fool (Willem Defoe) and have marvellous visions of an intricate, towering Tree of Kings – a recurring symbol - from which dead and future rulers hang from branches. As Amleth and his father wander back through the woods, the king is killed, decapitated (so many heads roll you can’t count them all) by his treacherous brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang; The Square; BBC’s Dracula; Daddy). He carries off a screaming Queen Gudrún (an icy, white-blonde Nicole Kidman, pictured below, with an accent about as convincing as the one in Nine Perfect Strangers. But she’s still a luminous, furious presence.) Somehow, impossibly, young Amleth escapes by boat to the Land of Rus, where we find him years later as a glowering, hardened Viking berserker, massacring innocents and tearing out victims’ throats with his teeth (takes you back to Skarsgärd’s Eric Northman in True Blood), obsessed with fulfilling his destiny of murdering uncle Fjölnir. He learns that his uncle is now farming in Iceland - ""Norway took his kingdom,” he’s told by a fellow-berserker. “I will avenge you, father, I will save you, mother,” is his muttered one-track mantra. He disguises himself as a Slavic slave on a Viking rowboat that’s bound for Fjölnir’s land and meets fellow slave, Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy; The Witch; The Queen’s Gambit; Peaky Blinders) to whom he briefly reveals his revenge plans. “My earth magic will stoke the flames of your sword,” is one of her come-on lines. Soon he’s all set to wreak havoc and ruin his uncle’s cosy set-up with Queen Gudrún and their two sons, Thórir, (a wonderfully cool Gustav Lindh) and Gunnar (Elliott Rose). Before he gets started, he proves his fighting excellence in a particularly nasty Viking version of lacrosse (basically, you club the other team to death, which might go down well in some boarding-schools). Obviously Gudrún is disguising her hatred of his evil uncle. Or is she? Never mind, he’s led by ravens to a sword, a magical night blade that will help him fulfil his purpose after he’s wrestled it from the arms of a skeleton king; Olga helps out with her earth magic, which involves poisonous shrooms that drive men into self-stabbing frenzies. Ghastly tableaux of dismembered bodies pinned to walls bewilder Fjölnir and family. “These wounds are not of this world, I will prepare a sacrifice,” declares the housekeeper, who quickly proves she’s good at finding defenceless female slaves to offer up. Worse is to come, as well as a quasi-incestuous encounter between Amleth and his mother. Before the spectacular final run-in between uncle and nephew, naked on an erupting volcano, there are moments of calm and hope between Amleth and Olga (pictured above) as they bathe in a healing hot spring. But as most of Amleth’s communication so far has been in mythic Norse growls, it's strangely disorienting to hear him say mildly, “I haven’t felt close to another person since I was a child.” Bring on the Viking counsellors."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," In keeping with the time-hoary notion of revenge being a dish best served cold is Robert Eggers‘ chilly Viking saga, The Northman. Adapting the legend of Amleth as a vessel for his continuing fascination with humans banished from culture or kin, the material appears to be hand tailored for Eggers, whose 2015 debut The Witch and 2019 followup The Lighthouse (read review) revealed a keen eye for horror tropes brandishing succulent nods to the perverse leanings of his cinematic inspirations. However, familiarity also breeds contempt, and Eggers taps into the template from which Shakespeare crafted his seminal Hamlet, albeit with a bit more brutality than the Bard. A handsome cast (with a poster hellbent on reflecting it, a la Villeneuve’s Dune) supplies the narrative with a hodgepodge of highlights despite the film resting largely on the shoulders of Alexander Skarsgard. Although neither as moody nor wacky as his first two films, it’s another masterful achievement from one of the English language’s most exciting contemporary arthouse filmmakers—-even if his latest would have benefitted from utilizing the source material’s mother tongue. In AD 895, Scandinavian Viking prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnesses his uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murder his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Fleeing for his life, young Amleth witnesses his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) abducted by Fjlonir, and he vows to return to avenge his father by killing his uncle and saving his mother. Years pass, and Amleth (now Alexander Skarsgård) has grown into a hulking warrior, aligning himself with a band of Berserkers. After taking over a village, he learns the enslaved survivors will be shipped off to the land of his uncle, whose kingdom was taken away by the King of Norway, diminished to lording over a significant farm land. Disguising himself as a captive, Amleth makes an immediate alliance with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a witch enslaved in the same caravan. Together, they hatch a plan to escape once Amleth satisfies his blood lust. As Amleth, Skarsgaard isn’t so brooding as he is maudlin. A key sequence with his mother in the third act solidifies something strangely original in Eggers’ offering—his protagonist is something of a simpleton, struck dumb with naïveté thanks to the childhood trauma defining his reason to live. However, when Skarsgard is forced to carry the saggy mid-section of the film, alongside Witch alum Anya Taylor-Joy, distracting accent work and inert diversions tend to soften the film’s initial gung-ho energy. The inevitable reckoning demanded of the narrative adds to a feeling of estrangement in The Northman, an element missing from Eggers’ earlier work, which established an uncomfortable intimacy with central characters losing their minds. This distance allows for a weariness to set in despite being bookended by wrath and rage. Still, we’re a world away from the limitations of similar cinematics Vikings, such as the similarly titled The Norseman (1978), headlined by Lee Majors. Sjon, fresh off another Icelandic provocation with 2021’s Lamb, co-wrote this saga with Eggers, gravitating towards suggested intimacies and alliances rather than dialogue. Though speckled with moments of sprawling violence and chaos, such as Amleth’s first adulthood sequences as a Berserker (a word derived from Bearskin, describing a cohort/gang much like feudal Japan’s samurais), Eggers pitches his film as a world only consistent in its discomfort, highlighted by a fitting score from Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough. His usual DP Jarin Blaschke may have more landscape to play with, but this is another world of dreary expanses where mud and blood commingle. Only the mystical flights of fancy provide an escape, such as the visualization of warriors ascending to the heavens, where Valhalla awaits, not to mention a ghostly battle for Amleth’s sword. Nicole Kidman, though using an accent similar to her Russian lilt in Nine Perfect Strangers, is a standout as the vicious Gudrun, overshadowing the likes of Claes Bang or even her own Valkyrian descendent in the form of Anya Taylor-Joy. Those hungry for Bjork’s return to the screen (in her first cinematic appearance since Matthew Barney’s Drawing Restraint 9, 2005) will likely be disappointed by her brevity, but both the Seeress and, later, the Sorcerer (Iceland’s Ingvar Sigurdsson) strike commanding moments. Both Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe lend their particular brand of off-kilter energy in the film’s first act (with Hawke representing a nice touch thanks to his own performance as Hamlet in Michael Almereyda’s Gen-X contemporization in 2000). Eggers expertly conjures a barbarous world, but it’s also an emotional void, where vengeance has been kept in an ice-box, unleashed to fulfill a relentless winter.

"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is everything we expect from director Robert Eggers – dark, surreal, atmospheric with a poetic intimacy for character building. The horror (the psychological and the physical) – the driving essence behind his previous films – remains a prevailing and haunting undercurrent in servitude of Eggers’ thematic exploration. Eggers continues to grow his craft as an auteur director. The Northman, the third feature-length film in his growing repertoire, already feels like a culmination of his visionary style and mood. For a director who has made notable, low-budget cinematic classics such as The Witch and The Lighthouse, the fascinating aspect behind his latest feature is its existence within mainstream Hollywood. When Hollywood decides to pluck a director out of the indie pool to enter the corporate, ideological world of studio institutions, naturally, there’s a fear. Since the studio system transitioned into an IP-driven entity (long gone the days of the movie brats who changed the face of 70s cinema), creative control fits in line with the commercialisation of the movie market. Films have interwoven nostalgic callbacks into their production DNA, and if you happen to have a long-running series (e.g., the MCU), then it guarantees its impact at the box office. Streaming services – accelerated because of the pandemic – now provide an eco-system for studio content that ties in with the shifting nature of our viewing habits. Acquiring sought-after directors (like Thanos possessing the Infinity Stones) self-acknowledges their eagerness to work with the industry’s hottest talent. And that pressure for success comes with bigger budgets and bigger expectations. There have been casualties with that system. Josh Trank, director of Chronicle, is a well-documented example on the pressures of early career success. Warner’s recent track record extends to their DC projects, starting with Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and David Ayer’s Suicide Squad. The eventual WB launch of HBO Max during the pandemic led directors such as Denis Villeneuve and Christopher Nolan to voice their dismay at the lack of warning. The latter left the studio associated with his greatest achievements for Universal. Lucasfilm parted ways with creators Lord and Miller on Solo: A Star Wars Movie. Even Eggers recently spoke out about The Northman and its challenging process. It’s a captivating experience watching a film marry between those two distinct worlds – the corporate and the visionary. On one hand, you’re seeing Eggers in his idiosyncratic and unapologetic element, flexing every muscle of the cinematic screen to deliver Viking folklore and mysticism. The other – a studio wondering if they knew what they signed up for! As a result, it’s Eggers’ most accessible film for his audience. But that transition also means a looser application of his work. To its credit, The Northman is a film rarely seen, especially in this modern iteration of Hollywood, marking the return of large-scale historical epics. The kind where its slow-burn drama is built on the Shakespearian mechanics of love, greed, death, and betrayal (aka The Lion King but in live-action form). The kind where the film can pull off an impressive one camera tracking shot (thanks to cinematographer Jarin Blaschke) as Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) brutally invades a village like a Nordic Terminator. In that veil comes a coming-of-age story; a young Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnesses the murder of his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and the capture of his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). With revenge in his heart, he vows vengeance against the man responsible for the betrayal – the King’s brother Fjölnir (played by the brilliant Claes Bang). As with Eggers’ previous work, there’s a lot to unpack. What works is the attempted subversion of the story. Eggers and Sjón’s scripted tale of vengeance tackles everything from toxic masculinity, hyper-male and animalistic aggression, and the noble quests of honour. The subject bears a similar resemblance to Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel. Its Rashomon-style story was a gateway to Hollywood conventions and how characters believed in their own mythology and fantasy, viewing themselves through a heroic lens as bastions of morality. While The Northman doesn’t indulge too heavily in perspective storytelling, it’s worth mentioning how idolised stories pass on between generations, where the expectation of man is so potent, the belief imprints on their psyche and soul. Skarsgård – majestic in the role – believes he is the chosen one, a primal vessel consumed by unrelenting rage where his retribution can restore the Kingdom’s respect. At noted points, it asks questions of its leading character. Does he have agency over his fate in a life that requires him to seek vengeance over his betrayers? Does hope exist in his brutal yet tunnel-visioned reality? Can he outrun fate bestowed upon him? Eggers sets up these existential questions like the psychological horrors he’s renowned for. With Amleth surrounded by visions, he slips the audience into a dream-like consciousness where the boundaries between reality and the otherworldly are seamless. Björk’s Seeress and Willem Dafoe’s Heimir the Fool relish the off-kilter opportunity to play characters who shape and destine Amleth’s life as a boyhood rite of passage. But it’s Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest who provides the most impact in a multifaceted performance, combining the spiritualism of faith and the steely determination to escape her enslaved life. Together, they strategize and plot the eventual takedown of the Kingdom. While Eggers excels in complex storytelling and engagement, the disappointing element is the lack of originality. Despite its deviated attempts to go off script, its trajectory is a linear story we’ve seen Hollywood do a thousand times without inventing anything new. Subsequently, that lack of cathartic satisfaction affects the runtime. At 2 hours and 16 mins, the material and depth are not sufficient to hold its pacing. Most likely, it will play better on a second outing, but the notable lapse in its middle phase is telling. But when it hits, it truly does. Its $90 million investment is worth every penny. Its scenic yet brutal landscapes are mesmerising. Its sound design and score are impeccable, and every calibre of its production design immerses you into its sensory mood, right down to its blood, gore, and savage violence. And visually, it helps keep the rudimentary parts of the story above that investment threshold. No complaints can be found from the rest of the cast. Hawke and Kidman have small roles but make every moment visibly count (particularly Kidman, who relishes every intricate detail of Queen Gudrún). Claes Bang is an excellent counterpoint to Amleth and a prime example of how noble quests and mythologies seek a different narrative on the truth. Taylor-Joy – already familiarised with Eggers’ trademarks thanks to her performance in The Witch – excels, ensuring a balance between the machismo and the story’s heart. The Northman won’t be for everyone. It may fall short of being a masterpiece (and Eggers’ best film), but it’s hard not to begrudge it. Some films are worth the effort, and Eggers proves he’s worth the engagement."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE,Metal as hell! An arthouse 'Conan the Barbarian' that makes 'Game of Thrones' look like 'Snow White'
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers finds the language of a movie before anything else. Drawing up the screenplay for The Witch, Eggers studied journals, diaries, and anything from the early days of American settlers that he could get his hands on. Through their particularly dated parlance, he crafted a haunting vision of religious fervor gone amuck in a haunted New England wood. For his sophomore feature, The Lighthouse, Eggers looked to the vernacular of folklore, myths, and seamen, spinning spittle-infused soliloquies about mariner curses on the 1890s high seas. His salty dialogue matched perfectly with Willem Dafoe’s wide-eyed delivery. With The Northman, Eggers pairs with Icelandic poet Sjón to find the language of the 9th century Nordic people. And their language is violence. The Northman stars Alexander Skarsgård as a vengeance seeking Viking prince and is a story of a life of death. Skarsgård is Amleth, both an anagram of Hamlet and the inspiration for Shakespeare’s tragedy about a prince who seeks vengeance against the uncle who killed his father and married his mother. The Northman tells the Viking story that inspired Shakespeare’s work with a pen dipped in blood and fire. Amleth is baptized into violence when his traitorous uncle Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) strikes down his father King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) and makes off with his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Vengeance ensues. Eggers pulls liberally from Viking and Icelandic mythology while working in nods to our most modern mythos – moviemaking magic – to craft a singularly epic explosion of cinematic verve. Formidable in scope and never-not-wowing from an audio-visual perspective, The Northman casually flirts with the great cinematic cornerstones of our times, making visual nods to films like The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars in ways that only an emboldened 38-year-old American director dare. Eggers’ exuberant style, one drenched in a deeply-felt love for the cinema, is splashed in rose-colored arcs across the screen, allowing for a film made from the stuff of teenage wet dreams given maturity, talented beyond measure, and all the resources one could ask for. The Northman presents a straight-forward revenge film splintered by the complications of Nordic mythos, making for a cinematic experience that operates as both a bloodlusty sword and sandals epic and Lynchian dream logic fable. Eggers had a formidable 90-million dollar budget to play with and he largely piles those riches into transporting audiences directly to his vision of the Viking age; building decadent sets from scratch; shooting on location in the resplendent, isolated environs of Scandinavia; staging incredible battle sequences; and creating a myth-driven dreamworld that intersects with the more grounded elements of the story in dizzying ways. It’s a no-holds-barred vision of barbarity, one wherein we never quite cast our lot in with the ostensible hero of the story, Amleth, for he is a man ruled by distemper and rage. In the pole position, Skarsgård gives the performance of a lifetime, transforming into an animalistic menace with hulking traps and burning ears. A lumbering slab of fury, ripped and howling with the lungs of a predator, Skarsgård’s performance is a physical wonder, capturing our attention early on and never letting go. Despite the unrelentingly barbaric, sinewy vision Eggers and Sjón maintain throughout, The Northman stills finds a twisted sense of humor, taking time out of the flaying and decapitation to make a flatulence joke every now and then. The Lighthouse was after all a good 50% fart humor. To contrast the Shakespearean heft of Amleth’s mud-stained earthly dramas, Eggers levies eye-popping visual effects that bewilder audiences trained to admire the self-same VFX of an increasingly-monopolized blockbuster aesthetic. The reins are removed in such a way to suggest Zack Snyder’s exuberant 300 had he had more narrative wherewithal. The film’s muscular machismo is never left unchecked. Amleth’s vein-popping madness is tempered by Anya Taylor-Joy‘s sly turn as Olga of the Birch Forest just as the sword-swinging capital justice is scattered by a seeress played by Björk. Myth and history swirl and intersect as Eggers allows the mixture of realism and surrealism to play out uninterrupted.The Northman is a vibe – angry and venomous and made up of brawny man meat – but it is entirely it’s own creation, unwaveringly so. Though The Northman cannot quite reach the same emotional and narrative heights of horror masterpiece The Witch, it remains nonetheless a staggering, singular vision of the horror of history and the magic of myth. In a time where the movie theaters of the world are becoming more and more a nesting ground exclusively for repetitive superhero antics, a 90-million dollar ultra-violent Viking epic The Northman feels like an adult antidote to the placidity of modern entertainment. Even if that means that it must carve the still beating heart directly from the chest of its enemies. CONCLUSION: A cinematic wonder of Viking violence and old-school melodramatic barbarity, ‘The Northman’ is an unrelenting and gruesome historic epic that showcases an absolutely berserk performance from Alexander Skarsgård and all the visual style and fascinating dialogue you’d expect from auteur Robert Eggers.

"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," TO Beowulf, or not to Beowulf – that is the question for this visceral, bloodthirsty and slightly bonkers Viking epic based on the Nordic folklore tale that also inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. It’s AD 895, and Alexander ­Skarsgård, as a hulking, monolithic slab of muscle and brawn, is the adult Prince Amleth, “a beast cloaked in man flesh”. He is out to avenge the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), which he witnessed as a child, at the sword of his Uncle Fjölnir (a menacing Claes Bang). Young Amleth, presumed dead, fled and does a stint living with sadistic warriors who pillage Slavic villages, before an opportunity arises to steal onto a slave boat destined for Iceland, where his treacherous uncle lives, now married to Amleth’s mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). This is director Robert Eggers’ first big-budget film and he’s made the most of it. Illuminated by fire and moonlight, there are some breathtaking shots tracking volcanoes and fjords. Native megastar Björk’s cameo as an eyeless, wheatsheaf-wearing seeress, or witch, is a treat, but Amleth flying into clouds on a white horse teeters on the Disney end of Fantasia. Sometimes intensity levels spill over into pure silliness — a young Amleth and his father on all fours, howling, burping and farting as they ritualistically morph into man-wolves has a strong whiff of drama school improvisation class about it. But not one performance lacks presence. Kidman is pure steel in Gudrún’s final confrontation with her first-born, Willem Dafoe, a captivating court fool, and Anya Taylor-Joy perfectly cast as Amleth’s ethereal love interest Olga. This Romancing The Stone-style film – co-written by the directing duo Oren Uziel and Dana Fox – follows a reclusive romance novelist and historian, Loretta Sage (Bullock), after she is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Abigail is the eccentric son of a billionaire media mogul who wants her to lead him to the ancient city from her latest story and find the lost treasure. But this is an odd-couple caper as Alan (Tatum), her book cover model and secret admirer, attempts to become the hero from her novels and rescue her.  Tatum and Bullock have phenomenal chemistry, both romantic and comedic, and play off each other to great effect while Radcliffe takes to Machiavellian villainry with considerable ease.  Throw in some small but impactful and fun performances from Brad Pitt as a CIA operative and Da’Vine Joy Randolph as Loretta’s publisher, and you have a romantic comedy that signals a return to form for a beloved genre. YET another World War Two saga to add to the cinematic library, Operation Mincemeat tells the real-life story behind the plan to conceal the Allie’s invasion of Sicily from the Nazis. Taking its cue from Ben McIntyre’s book, it follows the efforts of two MI5 operatives, Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth) and Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew Macfadyen), bidding to deceive Hitler. The agents planted fake documents detailing the supposed movements of British forces on the corpse of a tramp they dressed up as a naval officer. It is a remarkable storyline given the granular detail of character-building that went into the operation, as well as the connection to James Bond creator Ian Fleming (Johnny Flynn).  Screenwriter Michelle Ashford throws in a few amusing 007 references, though the script is never quite funny enough or sufficiently dramatic when it is trying to be. John Madden’s direction does inspire intrigue at times but the love-triangle side-plot between Firth, MacFadyen and Kelly McDonald’s secretary Jean Leslie feels tired and trite."
"Apr 15, 2022",NEUTRAL," The old Norse story that supposedly inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet is dramatised in a film so enveloped in gloom, so brutalised by violence, that I was mightily surprised to be reminded of the TV light entertainment show Stars In Their Eyes. But when a callow boy prince rows away from his forbidding Icelandic homeland having watched his father decapitated by his uncle, then returns years later, emerging through swirling fog as the ruthless avenger, bulging of bicep and dead of eye, I couldn't help but think of those sliding doors of blessed Saturday-night memory. 'Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be . . . The Northman.' The director is Robert Eggers, whose previous two features, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), mean that The Northman completes what we might call his definite-article trilogy.  The three films also have in common a dearth of anything that might be even vaguely construed as amusement, though I did quite enjoy a scene in The Northman in which our returning hero, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), engages in tenth-century Iceland's most popular spectator sport, a hybrid of rugby league, shinty and aggravated assault. Sky should snap up the global TV rights. Having witnessed his abruptly widowed mother (Nicole Kidman) being carried off by his uncle (Claes Bang), Amleth, posing as a Slavic slave, is hell-bent on rescuing her and punishing those who murdered his father (Ethan Hawke). That she might not want any kind of rescuing, let alone of the hell-bent variety, does not occur to him. As an Old Testament saga, Cecil B. DeMille's extravagant epic is not quite the perfect choice for Easter weekend, but with Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses II, it certainly has a divine cast. In truth, thinking is not something at which Amleth excels, though he does take a break from ripping out enemy entrails and ululating like a wolf in order to fall in love with a fellow slave (Anya Taylor-Joy), who has a nifty line in pillow-talk ('my earth magic will stoke the flames of your sword') and goes by the catchy name of Olga of the Birch Forest. Her face seems to fit every century but our own, though of course she can do that, too. Indeed, with Willem Dafoe cavorting as an audacious court jester, plainly influenced by the Fool in King Lear, and Bjork popping up as a mystic in a wheat-sheaf headdress, looking almost as weird as one of her own album covers, there are nearly as many reasons to watch The Northman as there are to avert your eyes from it.  But some of the violence is truly sickening. It's reasonable to assume there was a fair amount of raping and pillaging in the Icelandic Dark Ages, but the director does not spare us. He over-Eggers it, I'm sorry to say. As in The Witch, he also indulges his fondness for the supernatural. In a way, this is fitting in a depiction of a land so immersed in myth and legend. Grunting ogres, living skulls, white horses flying upwards to Valhalla, give or take a troll under a bridge it's all there, while cinematographer Jarin Blaschke makes the absolute most of the volcanic landscape. In fairness, too, there are a few genuinely riveting scenes, none more than when Amleth reveals himself to his mother, an encounter loaded with uneasy, incestuous tension, and you have to remind yourself that Kidman, eyes ablaze, was last seen on screen as Lucille Ball. If there were an award for Most Versatile Actress Despite Overdoing The Botox, she would land it every year. Yet for all its virtues The Northman is an unrelentingly bleak spectacle, nobody's idea of a fun night out. The Lost City might tick that box, if you don't mind a rehash of Romancing The Stone (1984) and can believe in a thunderously miscast Daniel Radcliffe as a villainous English media tycoon, even though he exudes as much menace as a ham-and-cheese sandwich. Sandra Bullock plays romance novelist Loretta Sage, kidnapped and taken to a 'forgotten' Atlantic island so that she might help Radcliffe's baddie find a priceless ancient artefact. Channing Tatum plays Alan, the dishy-but-dim model who features on Loretta's book covers as her fictional hero, Dash, and now intends to make life replicate art by saving her. Bullock and Tatum have an easy, winning chemistry, and Brad Pitt steals the few scenes he has as an alpha-male tracker, but the script is uneven, working too hard too often for the laughs. They do sporadically arrive — though no thanks to the former Harry Potter star, whose celebrity continues to obscure the unfortunate truth that his acting range, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker's famous line about Katharine Hepburn, runs the entire gamut from A to B. A 1956 film, The Man Who Never Was, first told the compelling true story of a feat of wartime subterfuge like no other, whereby British Intelligence used a corpse to hoodwink the Germans into thinking that, in the pivotal summer of 1943, Allied Forces would invade the European mainland through Greece rather than Sicily. Now, Operation Mincemeat re-tells the same story, but, inspired by Ben Macintyre's bestseller of the same name, it contains more facts than were known 66 years ago — principally that the dead body, dropped off the Spanish coast bearing fake papers, was really that of a Welsh tramp called Glyndwr Michael, who had died after eating rat poison. In death he became Major Bill Martin of the Royal Marines, and a trio of intelligence officers, all sporting the same stiff upper lip whether under a moustache or not, concocted a back story that would convince Nazi spies of his authenticity. The three men are Ewen Montagu, Charles Cholmondeley and future James Bond creator Ian Fleming, respectively and very nicely played by Colin Firth, Matthew Macfadyen and Johnny Flynn. A tip-top supporting cast also features Simon Russell Beale as Winston Churchill, Jason Isaacs as intelligence chief Admiral Godfrey, plus Penelope Wilton, Kelly Macdonald, Mark Gatiss, Alex Jennings and Hattie Morahan. It's a truly ripping yarn, to use period vernacular, to which John Madden's film mostly does proper justice. It's not perfect; a subplot in which Montagu and Cholmondeley both fall for the same woman, Macdonald's MI5 secretary Jean Leslie, feels like a duff note in a story that hardly needs contrivances forced on it. But that and a few other small gripes aside, Operation Mincemeat rattles along like a thriller with an ending we can't be sure of, even though we are. And might it be that Flynn's dashing performance as Fleming puts him in the frame to be the next 007? I first saw Paul Verhoeven's Benedetta (★★✩✩✩, 18, 131 mins) at last year's Cannes Film Festival. The Dutch writer-director is greatly admired there, but his French-language movie got a mixed reception — rightly so. It veers between soft porn and Carry On Up The Nunnery in its telling of the supposedly true story of Sister Benedetta (Virginie Efira), who is revered for her apparent hotline to the Almighty, but is punished for a love affair with another nun. With Charlotte Rampling as a mother extremely superior and cinematography that makes every other frame look like a Rembrandt, Benedetta would be a wimple-tastic new entry in the peculiar new genre of period lesbian drama (Ammonite etc) if it weren't so melodramatic."
"Apr 15, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) has become one of our most idiosyncratic filmmakers working today, delivering movies that are as obsessed with extreme historical accuracy as they are with the psychological depths of their characters.  The director’s latest, The Northman, which he co-wrote with Icelandic author Sjón (Lamb), is probably his most ambitious film in terms of pure bloody spectacle. While it might not be nearly so impressive on a thematic level as his other work, it’s a remarkable movie that explores the lengths a man will go to in order to live up to the legacy of his father and the myths that informed his upbringing. If you’ve seen The Northman trailer, you already have a firm grasp of the plot’s thrust from Alexander Skarsgård’s delivery of the line ""I will avenge you father. I will save you mother. I will kill you Fjölnir."" In a blatant 10th-century reinterpretation of Hamlet, Prince Amleth (Skarsgård) seeks revenge on his regicidal uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) after the death of his father (Ethan Hawke) and the abduction of his mother (Nicole Kidman).  Surviving as a refugee, Amleth develops into a musclebound village raider. He learns that Fjölnir has fled to Iceland to start anew, so he disguises himself as a slave and boards a boat bound for his uncle’s colony. His only ally is a fellow slave and witch named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who sees Amleth as her chance at freedom, providing a cunning mind to back up Amleth’s aggressive brawn. This sets the stage for a surprisingly straightforward story from Eggers, though the plot is not without its twists and turns that make for playful variations on its Shakespearian inspiration. The focus is more intentionally directed at the film’s sense of place and atmosphere. This may present itself in the form of period-authentic lodging and costume design, in the mythic gravitas of Amleth’s confrontations with the supernatural or in the explicitly gruesome bouts of violence that inevitably result in blood and viscera splattered everywhere.  The Northman isn’t shy about showing you the horrifying ways in which human and animal bodies are mere commodities for combat, sport, ritual and sacrifice — an early raid on a village rather quickly displays where the moral compass is pointed at this period of history. Yet these images are presented not simply to disturb the audience, but to show the natural consequences of a culture where most individual lives are not valued. What is valued, however, is the mythology that permeates their lives. Whether Amleth is receiving drug-clouded advice from shamans and witches, confronting supernatural horrors that may only exist in his childlike imagination or dreaming of his ascension to Valhalla as a hero of vengeance, The Northman is constantly mixing the beliefs of its characters with the bleak reality of their circumstances. This stylistic choice should be no surprise to fans of Eggers’ other movies, but here it seems to be the primary thematic point, a deconstruction of a classical revenge narrative by showing how stories and idol worship might convince a traumatized child they need to grow up into a vicious killer to uphold their familial honor. This makes Alexander Skarsgård a perfect casting choice for the role of Amleth. His familiar tendencies as an actor perfectly reflects the prince’s stunted emotional growth as he keeps all emotion repressed under a thin veil of stoic rage. This is supported by a wealth of great performances, from Bang investing Fjölnir with his own sense of familial duty, to Olga acting as a much-needed emotional release for Amleth, to Nicole Kidman delivering a shocking performance that completely subverts first impressions. There isn’t anything explicitly wrong with The Northman — though the runtime (more than two hours) might feel a little arduous if you aren’t prepared for it — but it feels a bit lacking when placed in the context of Eggers' other, superior work.  The Northman's priorities are in transporting audiences to a time and place that is nasty and brutal, depicting the kind of people that would thrive in such a social and natural environment, and revealing as to how their stories and myths might reinforce their brutishness. That may not be mindblowing, but it’s certainly compelling in its own right. The Northman delivers on its purpose in bloody, gory spades.

"Apr 15, 2022",NEGATIVE," Welcome to my site! My name is Andrea Thompson, and I’m a writer, editor, and film critic who is a member of the Chicago Indie Critics and also the founder and director of the Film Girl Film Festival, which you can find more info about at filmgirlfilm.com! I have no intention of becoming any less obsessed with cinema, comics, or nerdom in general. “The Northman” is a bit of a change of pace for Robert Eggers. His previous two features required a certain repression to not only get things going, but keep them going. And both basically ended in a metaphorical death by orgasm, whether it was spiritually in his feature debut “The Witch,” and more literally so in his later outing “The Lighthouse,” with a barely alive Robert Pattinson left writing in a Promethean state. If only sexual exploration and even full-on activity had been socially allowed, it’s hard to imagine either film coming to such darkly twisted ends. Vikings can’t exactly be counted to hold things in though. So what’s Eggers’s angle? Decadence isn’t exactly his style, what with his spare, austere settings and visceral sense of nature, which rules out death by sensuality. But if you like that kind of thing, it’s a good setting to go all in on that whole masculinity concept, and Eggers goes full throttle in a way uniquely his own. Because what better place to take it seriously? So seriously, in fact, that even frat boys will recognize all-male rituals that include hallucinogens, farting, and burping, with enough of Eggers’s singular touch to appeal to the indie crowd. It’s not as difficult as you’d think, and certainly no large task for a filmmaker who began his career as a production designer. Viewing “The Northman,” it’s difficult to recall that Eggers effectively made his breakthrough on a female protagonist and her struggles so well that “The Witch” received an endorsement by the Satanic Temple. But Eggers is a critically and commercially successful filmmaker now, so vulnerability be damned once a young Viking prince witnesses his father murdered and his mother and birthright stolen from him by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) and vows vengeance.  You can always count on things to get weird with Eggers, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they get interesting. That’s not to say it’s dull, especially since “The Northman” has co-writer Sjón to assist in the cultural side of things fresh off his bizarrely chilling Icelandic horror film “Lamb,” lending some credibility to such a heavily regional fright fest, most of which also takes place in Iceland. But even with the movie’s respect for the intricately detailed setting and the legends it birthed, everything can’t help being a reflection of Eggers, which only becomes an accusation when a director can’t see outside himself. And when the times not only force you to acknowledge other groups but insist they have a role in the story is when bigotry tends to come to the forefront. Things get especially repulsive after the kid grows up into Alexander Skarsgård. He’s joined a band of warriors and fits right into the classic Viking mold, assisting his band in sacking, pillaging, and in general causing families to be ripped apart, with children torn from their mother’s arms, innocent people being sold into slavery, and it’s heavily implied but not shown, rape.  Or does he? When a director is so personally invested in a main character and their views of the world, the opposition tends to be underdeveloped and/or cartoonishly evil. Same with the pretty young thing Skarsgård comes to fancy, Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga, who falls in love with this blonde embodiment of warriorhood, even though he helped destroy her home and directly caused her enslavement. She and his mother may as well be one and the same, sharing a history and far more. Yet it is Kidman who comes to embody the dark heart of the movie’s squeamish obsession with female power, with her actions making about as much sense as Daenerys Targaryen’s in the final season of “Game of Thrones.” Whether or not you can keep from laughing when Kidman says things like, “Your sword is long,” (I certainly couldn’t) will depend on how much you are invested in Eggers’s mindset and tastes. And he’s brought some familiar faces to make his case, both in front of the camera and behind, including cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and costume designer Linda Muir, who’ve both worked on Eggers’s previous films, and make the movie visually enthralling at least.  If it could’ve been bolstered by any sense of empathy for anyone besides Skarsgård, the raging spectacle surely would’ve been complete, even while clashing bizarrely with its warnings of the devastating price of vengeance. A few women and others deemed worthy may get pedestals, but it’s no substitute for actual development."
"Apr 15, 2022",NEGATIVE," The British film director Roger Michell died last year. His death was sudden and premature: he was only sixty-five. By all accounts a kindly soul, full of wise counsel, he has been much mourned; according to Kate Winslet, who worked with him on “Blackbird” (2019), he was “the master of no fuss.” “The Duke,” one of his most genial features, turned out to be his last. Nobody who saw it, as I did, at a festival in the fall of 2020 imagined that it would be kept from public view for so long by the global pandemic, still less that, by a cheerless irony, Michell would not live to see “The Duke” released. Now, at last, it’s here. Despite the title, this is not a costume drama, set in the loftier reaches of the aristocracy. Most of the story, until we arrive at the final stretch, takes place in Newcastle upon Tyne, in northeast England, in 1961. Here, in an ill-lit house, dwells Kempton Bunton (Jim Broadbent). What lord could boast a name more sonorous? Kempton is a working-class hero, or, at any rate, he would be if he could hold down a job. He is fired from a local taxi firm, in part for being constitutionally unable to leave his passengers in peace, and then from a bakery, for defending an Asian colleague from a racist superior. In his spare time, of which there is plenty, Kempton writes plays and dispatches them, in vain, to the BBC. He also takes a stand (sometimes sitting down in the rain) against the license fee that all television viewers, including pensioners, must pay. Kempton himself refuses to buy a license, and is sent to prison for his pains. In short, he is so bristling with principles that his wife, Dorothy (Helen Mirren), is in despair. When he invokes “the greater good of mankind,” she retorts, “Mankind? What about your own kind?” Charity stops at home. Enter the duke. The Duke of Wellington, that is, whose portrait, by Goya, has recently been acquired by the National Gallery, for a sizable sum that Bunton believes should have been spent on more honorable causes. Thus, a plan is hatched. Bunton goes to London. The painting—“It’s not very good, is it?” he says—is stolen overnight, smuggled to Newcastle, and stashed in a wardrobe. Ransom notes are sent to the authorities, who announce that the theft was clearly carried out by a “trained commando,” on the orders of an “international criminal gang.” In fact, the only other person involved is one of the Buntons’ sons, Jackie (Fionn Whitehead), and what he and his father dread most is not the heavy hand of the law but the thought that Dorothy might find out. Which, of course, she does. Bunton returns the picture to the gallery, explaining that he had merely borrowed it. He is arrested, charged, and put on trial. The nation, whose love of an underdog is stronger by far than its taste for nineteenth-century Spanish art, awaits. “The Duke” is as funny and as implausible as Michell’s “Notting Hill” (1999), the slight difference being that the ludicrous events in the new film happen to be true. There really was a Kempton Bunton, and he was indeed tried, in a tumult of publicity, for pinching the Goya. A satisfying courtroom scene is rarer than you might suppose, and the one that forms the climax of “The Duke” has a comic concision denied to the drawn-out shenanigans of, say, “The Trial of the Chicago 7” (2020). There’s something other than swiftness, though, to Michell’s method. He and his screenwriters, Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, are tapping into the kinship—explored by Dickens, and then by Gilbert and Sullivan—between legal and theatrical practice. Exhibit A: Jeremy Hutchinson, the barrister who defends Kempton (and who was married, as the movie reminds us, to the great Shakespearean actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft). He is played by Matthew Goode, an actor whose sleek demeanor can seem like a protective shell. Here, however, that very suavity becomes a weapon, gracefully wielded in tandem with his client’s cussedness. When Hutchinson sits down, having made his final pitch to the jury, the prosecutor—his opposite number—looks across at him and smiles, as if to say, “Beautifully done, you bastard.” If this is Goode’s best performance to date, it’s because he conveys the conscious delight with which his character, bewigged and robed, is performing a starring role. Like Hutchinson, Kempton rises to the rhetorical occasion, flush with the pride of the autodidact. “I’d just finished reading Joseph Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’ and I felt a need to explore Sunderland,” he tells the court. Alternately beaming and doleful, his face is that of a Mr. Punch who, in his own mind, has taken more blows from the world than he has dealt. In other words, we are squarely in Broadbent territory, where the stubborn abuts the crumpled, and it’s hard to conceive of anyone else in the part of Kempton. The result can be relished as a companion piece to Michell’s “Le Week-End” (2013), in which Broadbent portrayed a man less plumped-up with confidence, yet equally stuck in a stalled marriage. On second viewing, “The Duke” loses some of its capering gusto and takes on a surprising hue of sadness. I hadn’t realized, at first, how often we hear about the Buntons’ teen-age daughter, who died in an accident, and how much genuine grievance lurks in Dorothy’s defeated air. The film confirms that one of Michell’s enduring themes was exasperation—an unglamorous emotion, familiar to us all but, unlike rage, seldom given its cinematic due. Hence, perhaps, his interest in autumnal characters; facing and fearing a wintry future, they take stock of what they have done thus far, or frustratingly failed to do. Look at Kempton, grabbing a spot in the limelight before it’s too late; at the widow in “The Mother” (2003), who asks out loud, “Why shouldn’t I be difficult?,” and takes a younger lover; and, above all, at the peppery Peter O’Toole, in “Venus” (2006), slapping himself three times on the cheek and growling, “Come on, old man!” What a harvest of old men and women Roger Michell might have brought to the screen, as he ripened with age. Now we shall never know. Blood, mud, iron, fire, decapitated horses, and more blood: such are the main components of “The Northman,” a new movie from Robert Eggers. It’s a gutsy piece of work, not only in the reach of its ambition but also in its willingness to show us actual guts. We are in the era of the Vikings, one of whom is our hero. He is a man—or, rather, as somebody says, “a beast, cloaked in man-flesh”—called Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), who gets to pillage a village, roaring and baying as he glories in the rout, and thinks nothing of using his brow as a battering ram to crush the head of his foe. I couldn’t help wondering what Kempton Bunton would make of him. “Steady on, son,” he’d say, laying a friendly hand on Amleth’s shoulder. “How about a nice cup of tea?” As a boy, Amleth sees his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), slain by the foul-hearted Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who is Amleth’s uncle. Just to compound the transgression, Fjölnir carries off the dead man’s widow, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and marries her. Amleth’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to avenge this treachery. In short, as his name suggests, he is the ur-Hamlet, though not in every particular; I doubt that he was ever a freshman at Wittenberg, for instance, though he might have enjoyed the hazing. In an unprincely twist, Amleth becomes a rogue and peasant slave, like Maximus in “Gladiator” (2000)—biding his time, and awaiting a grand stage on which to deal the fateful blow. The biding is a problem for “The Northman.” Amleth comes upon Fjölnir, his target, less than halfway through the film, and you think, Now might he do it pat. One swing of an axe and his retribution would be complete. Instead, we have an hour’s delay, or more, in which Amleth—whose mind, if he has one, is never going to be wracked with the footling indecisions that hamper Hamlet—embarks on an earthy dalliance with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a fellow-slave, and plays a game of what appears to be homicidal Quidditch.

"Apr 15, 2022",NEUTRAL," Hey everyone! It’s time to update you on a bunch of the films I have been watching. I am planning on doing a longer review for Everything Everywhere All at Once coming this weekend (my thoughts on that delightful insanity can’t be limited to a mini review). There was also a really excellent Hallmark movie this month called Just One Kiss I highly recommend. It’s great for anyone not just Hallmark fans. The cast was the big reason why I was interested in watching Moonshot. I am not the biggest scifi fan but I love Lana Condor who was in the To All the Boys I’ve Loved series and Cole Sprouse has been charming in films like Five Feet Apart. Now I have seen it they are the biggest draw but it has enough fresh about it to recommend especially for teens or romance movie fans. Sprouse and Condor play young adults in 2049 who are trying to get to a colony that has been established on Mars. Condor is going to see her boyfriend where Sprouse is infatuated with a girl he has a meet cute with at the beginning of the film. The two become friends when he sneaks on board and she has to hide him from the space centers computer system. The production design is excellent here and both leads have nice chemistry. The story is something we’ve seen before but I didn’t mind that because it’s executed well. I appreciate they did not have her emotionally cheating on her boyfriend and the conflict had real emotion in it. It’s definitely worth checking out especially for romance fans. If you have followed my content for any amount of time you know how much I adore Julia Child. I find her story of setting out on a second career in her 40s to be so inspirational and I think her and Paul Child had a marriage to be envied. It is for these reasons I will watch anything about her including the new series on HBO Max called Julia.  It’s tough to capture Julia Child in media because she was the definition of larger than life. Her voice is so unique. She’s so tall at 6’2 and had a charisma unlike any other. I must admit Sarah Lancashire leaves a lot to be desired in her portrayal especially in the voice. It doesn’t sound anything like Julia. However, I was able to get used to her choices after a while and embrace the project. At first I didn’t like David Hyde Pierce as Paul Child. He was petty and jealous and from everything I’ve read that’s not who he was at all. They also seem to have combined Avis DeVoto and Julia’s sister Dorothy into one character but I didn’t mind that because I love Bebe Neuwirth who played her. Eventually Julia was able to win me over and I enjoyed it. It’s not the Julia Child parts of Julie and Julia but it’s a nice depiction of Julia’s start on television. I am sure there will be many people who will be singing the praises of Robert Eggers new film The Northman and I can see why. It is very ambitious and well made with good performances from all involved. The problem is it’s so brutal and joyless that it becomes a slog. What happened to fantasy stories being even a little bit inspirational? A film like The Northman has no heroes let alone a heroes journey. It’s just one scene of brutality after another. That’s not entertainment to me. The Northman tells the story of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) and how he seeks revenge on the man who kills his father in the opening scenes. His mother is played by Nicole Kidman and Anya Taylor-Joy plays his love interest Olga. The story brings in supernatural elements in some truly bizarre scenes and as I said the actors throw their all in it but it becomes exhausting. Eggers needs to allow some moments of quiet so we can get to know the characters and feel invested in their journeys. This was too much of everything and I grew weary of it (it’s 137 minutes!). If it sounds like something you’d like than go for it but it definitely wasn’t for me. One Road to Quartzsite is directed by Ryan Maxey and it takes a slice of life approach to following the people at Quartzsite, Arizona as they gather in camps and RV centers to share their life experiences together. It’s interesting to see people that are in many ways outcasts and loners find solace in community just like the rest of us do. These kind of documentaries will be too slowly paced for some but if you are interested in the lives of these modern nomads you should be entertained. I also loved all of the folk music played throughout. One Road to Quartzsite sounds interesting!  Thanks for the post!  My movie buff self has been slacking when it comes to films these days and you just inspired me to do more movie posts.  Thanks for the unintended push in the right direction!"
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," Reviewed by Dennis SchwartzBloody but brilliant medieval vengeance tale by the American writer/director Robert Eggers (“The Lighthouse”/”The Witch”) and his Icelandic poet/novelist co-writer Sjón. Its story is based on both Norse myths and Icelandic family sagas, especially evoking the Scandinavian legend of Amleth that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. There are beautiful visuals, fine long takes, long sequences capturing the strange looks of that period of time, witches casting spells, an enthralling atmosphere, superb dream sequences, brutal fight scenes and implicit demands are made on details for both campy and accurate dialect in speech (the use of Old Norse), and is helped considerably by its rapid pace (making it an easy watch). Cult filmmaker Eggers never made such a pic before and wisely uses this one’s whopping budget of $90 million to make it look good. With the help of production designer Craig Lathrop and costumer Linda Muir, the film gives us the 10th century looking as savagely and violently as possible. Think Hamlet, as the tale follows the young Viking, Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a Hamlet figure who seeks to avenge the murder of his loving tribal chief father, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), after witnessing as a young boy of ten his Uncle Fjolnir (Claes Bang) murder him and run off with his unwilling mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), draped screaming over his shoulders. The boy escapes by boat and vows to rescue his mom and kill his father’s assassin.  Then he meets in the forest the feral Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and falls for her. Also there is the seeress (Björk), who directs him to avenge his father by killing his murderer uncle. The prince gets back on track with his vengeful life mission, and chooses to torture uncle before killing him and then his army goes to battle with the enemy.  It has star power (with an exceptionally good physical performance from Skarsgård and a demure one from Taylor-Joy). It compares favorably with Richard Fleischer’s less hysterical Viking epic, The Vikings (1958). At times overwrought with a violence that seems cartoonish, it nevertheless is a fully composed traditional saga that is both awesome and commands respect for its cinematic accomplishments. It allows us to see how the Vikings behaved back then. The visuals by DP Jarin Blaschke are immensely powerful and the musical score by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough has a chilling effect when played so proficiently on the original Viking instruments of the birch horn and bone flute."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ films typically operate on two levels, with the aesthetic stylization of the genre he’s working in serving to compliment whatever larger story he’s trying to tell. Unlike his former labelmate Ari Aster, I don’t see this as a concession made in order to secure funding, as Eggers follows ideas and imagery he’s intrigued by to interesting ends. Like the best examples of the genre, The VVitch used its folk horror trappings to explore a deeper and richer family drama about religious fundamentalism, where a pious father reaps what he sows after he estranges his family from their puritan community (I also don’t see it as an example of “Good for her” horror cinema, as the meme goes, but that’s because I find the tragedy angle to be more dramatically compelling). The Lighthouse, on the other hand, took the aesthetics of silent-film era surrealism, paired with Lovecraftian high weirdness, and applied them to the conventions of the buddy comedy, and there were few cinematic delights as genuinely charming as when audiences discovered that they could, you know, laugh at the movie and were intended to by the filmmaker. His latest film, the Viking epic The Northman, works similarly, though it’s a little harder to tell than in his prior work. At its core, The Northman is a relatively simple story, almost entirely summed up by the chant that young Viking prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) shouts as he rows away from the ruin of his father’s kingdom: “I will avenge you, father. I will rescue you, mother. I will kill you, Fjolnir.” If the name “Amleth” sounds familiar to you, it’s perhaps because it sounds like “Hamlet,” from which Eggers and his co-writer, the Icelandic poet Sjon, seem to have derived some manner of influence. Regicide is the inciting incident: After returning from a raid, King Aurvandeil (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his brother, the “Fjolnir” (Claes Bang) of the chant, in front of his son, with the boy’s mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) seized as property along with his holdings. The child knows his life is in danger and flees to the sea. But we get enough glimpses of the peaceful life of young Amleth to make the pain of his angst feel righteous when it comes time for him to pay the piper — Eggers presents to us a Viking ritual where the King and his son engage in a hallucinogenic rite of passage, acting like dogs and wolves and learning from the court jester (Willem Dafoe), dressed out in medieval fetish wear, the family’s legacy, visualized through a gorgeous CGI physical representation of a genealogical tapestry: Kings connected to the trunk and its branches via umbilical cords, ties that bind them to the history of their people at large. As long as he remains alive, Amleth’s connection to his family remains unbroken, and his fate is his own to make.  Flash-forward a few decades later: Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) is All Growns Up, a heaving mass of single-minded muscle, fighting under the banner of a raiding band of more “traditional” Vikings. Clothed in animal skins and screaming bloody murder, they sack, loot, kill, maim, rape, massacre, and sell whoever’s leftover into slavery. Well, Amleth doesn’t do some of those things, because he retains some aspects of the high-birthed child he once was back in the day — he refuses to harm women or children, and takes some manner of pity for those he’s conquered — but Eggers is keen to point out that this era fucking sucked to live in, almost as a way of counteracting the immense amount of fantasizing that certain folks do about living in a culture long past that they’ve romanticized beyond all recognition. “Nasty, brutish and short” doesn’t even begin to cut it: One is always moments away from being led away from all they’ve known by horrible men wielding iron, the great mead hall, that you used to celebrate minor triumphs in, slowly burning, as the screams of everyone not fit enough cross an ocean and then to labor in the fields in some minor fiefdom echo about until they, like the blazing building, slow to a steady smolder. This is what Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) experiences at the hands of Amleth’s band. She tries to strike back against them, however she can, but she’s quickly taken away with the rest of the slaves, branded, and put on a boat headed for Iceland.  It’s then that, following a premonition from a witch (Bjork) in the husk of the hall, Amleth discovers  that the ship Olga’s being taken to is headed for Fjolnir’s land, and the intervening years haven’t been kind to him, at least when it comes to matters of personal property: He owns a tiny hamlet, out in the rolling green hills, eeking out a small living with Gudrun, their children, assorted villagers and plenty of slaves. He brands himself, cuts his flowing hair, and sneaks aboard the ship to fulfill his quest, which has taken on a somewhat mythic status, seemingly encouraged by the Gods themselves, who, like in The VVitch, are a distant but very real presence in the world of these characters, who have taken a keen interest in this quest for vengeance, though they move in mysterious ways. At its intellectually and aesthetically purest form, The Northman is a loving tribute to the fascination that we’ve had with the Vikings over the decades, exploring why their legends endure and their culture remains of endless curiosity and speculation while grappling with the reality of their terror, all unfolding atop landscapes so gorgeous and varied in their topography that it’s often surprising. The lands aren’t all ice and snow: there are peaceful green hills, covered in rock; volcanos spitting fire into the air; and lush forests, full of life. The answer to the question posed in the previous paragraph can be found in that second aspect of The Northman‘s operation: It’s just so fucking metal, dude. “Badass” doesn’t even quite cut it here, because it’s much more intense than that. There are names and sayings in this movie that will be lifted by a thousand bands in need of something badass to go by when they play their first shows, and you can practically hear the Sludge to Come leaking out of the pipes of time itself as the film unreels. One typically has to rotoscope images that rips this hard — be it in Heavy Metal, Fire and Ice or The Spine of Night — or try their hardest to resist studio temptation to make things more palatable. But Eggers has retained almost all of the key aspects of his style here, with his warm fire-lit interiors and bleak panoramas adding to the fury of the bloodshed. It’s another notch in the belt of my theory that the best fantasy directors, be it Boorman or Scott or Jackson, were at one point successful horror filmmakers, with their cinematic understanding of the uncanny easing the transition between varying forms of the sublime and terrible. His action is vicious and bloody, with practical effects used where possible (I will not hold it against any filmmaker for using the occasional bit of CGI blood splatter when they’re doing a fucking 10-minute tracking shot featuring two hundred extras engaged in hand-to-hand combat), and you will notice when exactly his horror expertise comes into play — mangled corpses, et cetera. It’s just so overwhelmingly cool, hitting at the perfect intersection of cinephile, history nerd, Tomb Mold listener and fantasy fan quadrants on a hypothetical interests chart. But what’s so amazing and essential about The Northman is how populist and accessible it is to any viewer who buys a ticket while Eggers also retains so much of what makes him such a unique and interesting director. There’s been a quote circulating about where the director’s talking about how a viewer at a test screening told him that they needed a PHD in Viking history in order to understand the film, and I can say without a doubt: If you didn’t need to have read The Lord of the Rings before sitting down and watching Fellowship back in ’01, you’ll likely have a similar experience. It’s a revenge tale masterfully told, simple in its visceral pleasures but with more complex aesthetic and thematic notes left to discover if you want to. Though I’m sure that many enterprising young minds will become super curious about this, steeped in Norse mythology-adjacent fantasy like the Thor films and the most recent God of War video game, I’m equally sure that lots of folks will be pleased to discover the film doesn’t require you to see get an advanced degree in order to enjoy it for what it is. It is, in essence, the ideal form of the Major Label Debut: With real-ass capital behind them, some folks conform to the mean and produce bland and meaningless art, others go excessively ambitious and alienate everyone around them, and every so often, you’ll find an artist who knows how to manage their large-scale fantasies and give them life. The Northman is just that sort of masterpiece. "
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," As Hollywood goes through it's trends, releasing films of similar veins, the outsiders continue making films that challenge the norm and new insight to genres that have been neglected. Vikings were once a source for cinematic appeal, briefly. If anyone can recall that over dramatic swashbuckling action film starring Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis as friends and rivals in the 1958 classic, The Vikings, Robert Eggers' vision will definitely knock any remaining memory from your mind. Eggers' take on the Vikings is something to behold and marvel at. There is violence, death, horror, copious amounts of blood and deep-seated vengeance at the core. Those who are squeamish, need not see this epic. However, they would be missing out on a truly fantastic, mesmerising slice of cinema. After his beloved father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) is cruelly murdered in front of him by his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), young Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) flees his home, vowing that one day he will return and have his revenge. Years later, Amleth is grown, not just as man but a wild beast. Once he finds his way to his uncle, by the guidance of the gods and through witchcraft, he plots his deadly vengeance, but how far will he go to ensure he avenges his father? Inspired by the legend of Amleth, the Viking Prince, Eggers and co-writer Sjón, have created a fantastical world filled with Norse mythology, paganism and the supernatural. All of this feels grounded by historical design of the players, sets and costumes, right down to the behaviours of the characters. Everything seems like it was completely natural, even the scene where two Vikings fight naked in a volcano. In fact, the Vikings seem to do quite a few activities in a near naked state from rites of passage, war dancing by a fire, going into battle and avenging one's father. Alexander Skarsgård was born to play Amleth, he is The Northman. Embodying Amleth's damaged heart and soul, he rips through the screen as a wild beast, barely tamed but able to methodically plan out his uncle's demise. He's matched well with Anya Taylor-Joy's sorceress from The Rus, who doesn't steal the spotlight but does embellish Skarsgård's protagonist. Their rather gentle romance is also not over blown, it is carefully woven into the story. It's also good to see other returnees from The Witch, even in smaller roles, with Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson making an appearance. However, the scene stealer of the film is Bjork herself as a Seeress, who prophesies Amleth's road to revenge. It is utterly beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Moulding together historic fiction, inspiration from legends and the true horrific nature of the Vikings, the fantasy elements are never exaggerated but like the rest of the film, beautifully portrayed on screen. Not to mention the amazing locations in Ireland, standing in for Iceland for the most part. There is so much about this film to appreciate. There is no doubt that Eggers has a distinct style. As his filmography grows, he will hopefully continue this way of making films that are as atmospheric and visceral as they are gut retching and bold. The Northman isn't just a violent story about revenge, there are scenes of devastation that barely involve a drop of blood, right next to tender stolen moments of affection, all of which have a place in this saga."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," Documents found on the corpse revealed it to be one Major William Martin, who was carrying an attaché case containing top secret plans for an Allied invasion of Greece. They presumed the point of attack would be Sicily, and had bolstered defences there accordingly, but the information recovered on Major Martin aimed to convince the Nazis otherwise. It was all a lie. Major Martin was a fictional creation and the whole thing had been dreamt up by a Naval Intelligence team that included James Bond creator Ian Fleming. The ensuing success of this crazy plan was nothing short of a miracle, and John Madden’s winningly old-fashioned drama Operation Mincemeat deftly tells its story. It’s been told before on-screen in Ronald Neame’s rather stolid 1956 account of the incident, The Man Who Never Was, but Operation Mincemeat has more freedom of movement: all the key players are now dead, and recent declassification of government files has revealed more detail about the operation, including the body’s true identity. In 1939, Godfrey had circulated a paper which came to be known as the ‘Trout memo’, which compared deception of the enemy to trout-fishing, and outlined various ways in which the Nazis might be profitably misled. In October, 1942, an RAF flight lieutenant and counter-intelligence operative called Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew Macfadyen) floated the plan of placing false papers on a dead body. Godfrey hated the idea, but to his amazement, Winston Churchill gave it the thumbs up. Churchill was deeply worried that the Allied plan for an invasion of Sicily was so obvious that Axis forces would be ready for it, meaning huge casualties. Naval Intelligence officer Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth) was seconded to work with Cholmondeley on the wheeze, now given the grisly title ‘Operation Mincemeat’. Fleming would also be involved, along with two women from Naval Intelligence’s secretarial corps, Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton) and Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald). The level of planning was remarkable. Once the right body was found, Montagu and the team created a ‘legend’ for their imaginary soldier, William Martin. It’s a marvellous story, one even a writer as fanciful as Ian Fleming couldn’t have made up, and Madden and screenwriter Michelle Ashford do a solid job of telling it. Tentative forays are made into the private lives of the main characters: Cholmondeley is lonely, Montagu unhappily married, and both are smitten with Jean, who is flattered but elusive. One gets the sense too, that this is a plan no one feels particularly proud of. Deception never feels particularly honourable and there’s also the matter of poor Glyndwr Michael, a forgotten man who died in appalling circumstances and did not consent to the posthumous mobilisation of his person. Shakespeare robbed most of his plots, including Hamlet, which was based on a Norse saga. That sorry tale forms the core of Robert Eggers’ remarkable and unflinchingly brutal epic, which stars a bulked-up Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth, a Viking warrior prince. As a child, Amleth watched his uncle, Fjölnir (Klaes Bang) murder his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and usurp his queen (Nicole Kidman) and throne. Now fully grown and furious, Amleth tracks Fjölnir down on a remote Icelandic farm. What happens next is not pretty, as all manner of bloody indignities are inflicted on the bodies of Amleth’s enemies, some of which he strings up into a kind of charnel house art installation. Eggers is a skilful and imaginative director, and his films achieve almost unbearable levels of intensity: The Northman is a brilliantly realised saga that burrows its way to the heart of the Viking sensibility. The violence, though, is relentless. I’m sure it’s entirely legitimate to wallow in the full horror of the human condition: I’m not sure how helpful it is though. There are numerous moments in the Nee brothers’ The Lost City when their frothy pudding gets over-egged, but luckily for them, a master comic actress is on the case, and Sandra Bullock wrings full value from her role. Bestselling author Loretta Sage (Bullock) has become a recluse since her husband’s death, and announces that her latest ‘Dash McMahon’ adventure-romance novel will be her last. Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum), a book cover model who’s become the face of Loretta’s hero Dash, is not pleased, but before you know it, the pair have been sucked into a real-life adventure on a remote island involving lost treasure and a mad billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe). It’s fun for the most part, borrowing shamelessly from Indiana Jones movies and Romancing The Stone. And Brad Pitt makes a hilarious cameo as Jack Trainer. When Loretta asks Trainer why he’s so handsome, he replies cryptically, “my father was a weatherman”."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," “Fate has no mercy” is quite the fitting line from this bloody and brutal Viking revenge tale, as acclaimed arthouse director Robert Eggers (The Witch & The Lighthouse) combines his signature quirky style with Nordic mysticism for an adaptation of the influential Icelandic tale. With the popularity of Norse mythology and Viking culture ever enduring, thanks in part to acclaimed TV shows Vikings and The Last Kingdom and games Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and God of War, Eggers has set out to create one of the most accurate Viking films yet in his biggest screen outing. Based on the Saga which inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet (and in turn Disney’s The Lion King), Eggers and co-writer, Icelandic poet Sjón, has crafted a brutally epic Viking saga about the endless cycle of vengeance and violence, with his on brand bonkers mysticism and mythology interwoven throughout. Though the lush landscape is sprawling, the big-scale battle sequences primal and ferocious and the themes explored are weighty, at its heart is a surprisingly intimate character study delving and questioning the nature of this hero’s journey. Though the more out there ritual sequences may alienate some, The Northman is undeniably a fascinating look at shifting perspectives, the true cost and folly of revenge and the reverberating effects of legacy and honour. The runtime is a lengthy 137 mins split, between five distinct chapters, but there’s never a dull moment in this gripping tale of familial drama, tender romance and otherworldly influences. “I will avenge you father; I will save you mother; I will kill you Fjölnir” is the often repeated motif by our anguished ‘hero’ Amleth, as Alexander Skarsgård utterly transforms into a truly hulking berserker warrior with a single-minded goal. Driven by the belief that he cannot escape his fate, that it’s his one true destiny to avenge his father, Amleth transforms himself into a true fighting machine, twisted by brutal vengeance. With such a cold, calculated and almost inhuman ferocity, it is at times hard to root for the tragic Prince, especially in the more violent and cruel raiding sequences – but the trajectory of his arc does shift once he meets Anya Taylor Joy’s radiant and resourceful witch, along with his long-lost mother and step brother. Skarsgård is incredibly captivating during this gradual evolution, expertly portraying a divided and torn Amleth. Furthermore, the whole cast fully commit to the often outlandish and primal roles, particularly Hawke and Willem Dafoe’s court-jester in an particularly bonkers rites of passage sequence (complete with farts, burps and trippy literal family tree with the fruit bearing the lineage of kings.) While you kid be forgiven for thinking Kidman is relegated to a brief motherly role, she truly encapsulates the familial chaos in a brilliant turn in the third act, twisting Amleth’s worldview completely. While Björk’s fascinating seeress is unfortunately underused, Eggers fans will enjoy small cameos from regulars Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson. While the heart of the narrative treads a relatively simple and well worn tale, its the pure cinematic spectacle in which the film truly roars to life. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke makes full use of the sweeping grandiose shots of the stark natural (and often harsh) beauty of the landscape – particularly with the spewing volcano looming large – as a backdrop, often bathing sequences in monochrome starkness or rich, earthy greens. The spectacle continues with an impressive single take action sequence following a brutally graphic and intense raid on a small village, tracking Amleth’s bear/wolf spirit animal frenzy as he leaps off buildings to bring down horsemen with axe and short sword in tow. The immersive spectacle and brutality of the action paired with composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s pulsating and chest beating score, makes for a truly unique experience, often leaving you breathless and on the edge of your seat.Like his previous outings, Eggers once again fully commits to the period detailing, meticulously replicating villages, boats, costumes and weapons, along with the traditional funeral rites, trials and festivities. This grubby, Old World setting is cleverly juxtaposed with the more mystical and supernatural visions, as the director delves into Norse mythology, complete with dreams of soaring valkyries, clashes with undead swordsman, prophetic seers and visions of literal family trees. This big-screen mythological dive feels like a kindred spirit to David Lowery’s epic medieval fantasy The Green Knight, which also cleverly explores the archetypal tale of heroes and villains with fate and destiny.  The Northman is one of the most visceral cinematic experiences for some time. A bold, bloody & violent tale of vengeance & fate, it’s a captivating but trippy journey which won’t work for everyone (à la The Green Knight), but there’s no denying the utterly impressive scale & technical feat involved. A truly modern epic from Robert Eggers. Nicola is the digital marketer and Editor-in-Chief of We have a Hulk.

"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"Our adoration of The Northman has little to do with the level of violence on screen... and more to do with the craft, scope and skill that went into creating the first great blockbuster of the year."
"Apr 14, 2022",NEUTRAL," On its face “The Northman” seems to continue Robert Eggers’s opening career salvo of films with an uncompromising vision and while “The Northman” does leave one with that impression, his third film is the first that seems to eschew tonality and lowers itself into the ranks of films made with form in mind rather than function. Where “The Lighthouse” conveyed its madness not just to the audience but its characters in their slow maddening descent “The Northman” dips its toes into many different wells of human emotion but just as quickly pulls back before entertaining another. Feeling more like the prologue to your character in the latest Assassin Creed game than a full character itself. The stakes though inviting as they may seem are underwrought. And while that may be their very purpose on the page, in the film the absence of engaging reasons to stay invested undermines the entirety of the saga Eggers seeks to tell. We have no stake in the game by the film’s end, no emotional catharsis, or even a convincing reason as to why we should care whether or not a Valkyrie brings our hero to Valhalla. Where Anya Taylor-Joy’s Thomasin in “The VVitch” was distant, we felt through the form of the film her terror and unknowing, those emotions and the way she was captured feeling them is largely what gives that film resonance years later (Though Black Philip deserves a fair amount of credit too.) within “The Northman” though, we have no tangible reason care for her, her life before slavery, nor her life after, she’s a plot point. Like every other character. She’s nothing more than a function to the narrative; the emotionality that Eggers found and slow boiled into audiences in both “The Lighthouse” and “The VVitch” is absent in such a deafening way that one might be convinced that its emotional distance and opacity is a deliberate choice he made. It does have distinctive moments, excerpts from its long and winding tale that despite being divorced from tangible emotionality are strong. Such as Willem Dafoe’s Heimir the Fool sequences, Ethan Hawke’s King Aurvandil and young Amleth crawling around on all fours acting like ravenous dogs, and Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) stealing a sword from a burial site(Though this does feel like nothing more than a fetch quest in whichever RPG you’re most familiar with.). And yet building this list of things that aren’t “negatives” so clearly underlines the fundamental issue of “The Northman;” its disparate parts are incohesive. It doesn’t feel whole. Not that any film has the responsibility of being seamless, but on the trajectory of a story primarily about a single character for which the film is named, it isn’t unreasonable to desire something that permeates the curving path of the narrative to resonate with those viewing it. “The Northman” feels more akin to a Discovery Channel reenactment from a master cinematographer than a film from an up-and-coming auteur. But even Ang Lee had “Gemini Man” and Michael Mann likewise had “The Keep,” a fully committed misstep needn’t be overblown this early in a filmmaker’s career, perhaps lowered expectations going into his next feature is something we all could use."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"One of the most breathtakingly nuts movies in recent years, a died-in-the-wool Viking revenge epic that feels every bit like a visionary has been given money to burn for the first time in his life, and is going to take full advantage of it."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," Since his debut film, The VVitch, in 2015, Robert Eggers has cemented himself as one of the most intriguing and unique directors working today. With its cerebral pacing and spine tingling finale, Eggers captured cinephiles’ attention and continues to hold it. Eggers followed it up with the imaginative and bat-shit crazy The Lighthouse. A film that put Lobster on the map in a better fashion than Red Lobster. With those two films under his belt, it’s safe to say the anticipation for his latest film, The Northman, was high. Quickly jumping into my top 10 most anticipated films of 2022, Eggers’ latest had plenty of expectations going in. Never compromising his unique style, he crafts a visceral Viking epic with The Northman. Eggers’s spellbinding blend of blockbuster and art house gives us a haunting experience that will be celebrated amongst the upper echelon of cinema in 2022. Co-written by Eggers with Sjón, The Northman follows Amleth, a young prince who is forced into exile after the murder of his father. Before expulsion, Amleth made a vow to bring vengeance for his father’s murder by killing the man who brought death to his family and rescuing his mother. Eggers and Sjón’s screenplay is more in line with a traditional tale of revenge than his first two films. Effectively capturing the hate running through Amleth’s veins, the script examines the animalistic nature of hate and its consequences. Sjón and Eggers craft a screenplay that masterfully blends brutality with Viking ritual, one of the film’s biggest strengths. Cinephiles are treated to an artistic bloodbath that can only come from the mind of Eggers. The film lands as his most audience accessible film. There is no denying that Egger’s imagery is on full display. Academy Award nominee Jarin Blaschke returns after his tremendous work on The Lighthouse to lens one of the hypnotizing cinematic experiences of the year. Blaschke captures the breathtaking landscapes that encapsulate the enormous scope of The Northman while immersing cinephiles into a dreamlike escape of Viking lore. Aiding Blaschke’s lens is Sebastian Gainsborough & Robin Carolan’s score. There’s nothing better for a film score lover than a score that brings chills throughout every piece of music. 2022’s film scores are off to an incredible start as this is the second time in just the last two months where a score has left quite an impact on me upon the film’s conclusion. The Northman’s ensemble came to play! Not one actor in the film phones it in. Academy Award winner Nicole Kidman takes her talent to create a cunning matriarch while eliminating the traditional damsel in distress trope that often comes from the wife in these films. Matching Kidman is Anya Taylor-Joy, who continues to show why she’s one of the rising actress working today. What feels like a continuation of her character in The VVitch, Joy is magnetic and whimsical. Ethan Hawke and William Dafoe are both endearing despite not much screen time. However, all the performances pale in comparison to the work of Alexander Skarsgård. Skarsgård is frightening, fierce, & brutal. In a career-best take, Skarsgård’s interpretation aligns with Ryan Gosling’s magnetic performance in Drive. A first performance that audiences will remember as one of the best of the year. In a year full of blockbusters, few and far between will be as ambitious as Eggers’s The Northman. Many have classified the film as “a $90 million Robert Eggers film,” and there’s no better way to describe it simplistically. However, The Northman feels like a film that only an auteur with the creativity of Eggers could create, and cinephiles are better for it."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," With The Witch and The Lighthouse, writer-director Robert Eggers emerged as a distinctive voice in American independent film. They are surrealistic nightmares set in America of centuries past, in which small groups try surviving encroaching supernatural threats that may well be hallucinations encouraged by harsh surroundings. Their environments are brought to life with an exquisite sense of historical detail and period-accurate language. In light of this, that Eggers’ third feature, The Northman, is a big studio-backed, sprawling Europe-set epic that can plausibly, and not inaccurately, be marketed as an action movie might raise red flags for those concerned his voice could be lost – budget-wise, it’s closer to a Morbius than The Witch. But praise the Norse gods, for not only is The Northman an exhilarating revenge saga that outdoes most modern blockbusters when it comes to action sequence staging and immersive sound design, but Eggers’ penchant for the strange remains fully intact. Co-written with Icelandic multi-hyphenate Sjón (a regular collaborator of Björk, who’s among the uniformly excellent cast), The Northman’s story is deceptively simple, with a far shakier moral compass than most films of its ilk. Beginning in 895 AD before jumping forward, The Northman chronicles Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a presumed dead Viking prince, now an adult seeking vengeance upon treacherous uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) for the murder of his father (Ethan Hawke) and capture of his mother (Nicole Kidman). A figure from medieval Scandinavian legend, Amleth is the direct inspiration for Shakespeare’s Prince Hamlet, meaning that The Northman’s structure inevitably resembles the barebones of Hamlet’s plot. Or to compare it to another Hamlet riff with fantastical flourishes, think The Lion King, but with considerably more decapitations, pillaging, murder sculptures and buttocks. No lions, although hulking Skarsgård resembles beast more than man at times in his descent into personal hell."
"Apr 14, 2022",NEGATIVE," And yet here was The Northman, doing what I’d always wanted a Shakespeare adaptation to do: make me feel the way people who love Shakespeare must feel when they watch it, the way Shakespeare’s patrons must’ve felt in his own time. The Northman is like that, this grand goth spectacle with a story that moves like music and characters who are as much fable and myth as they are people, recognizably human but slightly unknowable and awe-inspiring, like old testament gods. Admittedly, that makes The Northman sound a lot more cerebral than it actually is. Make no mistake, director Robert Eggers (who co-wrote the script, with Lamb co-writer Sjón) is certainly a cerebral guy, who attempted to resurrect a dead dialect for his debut feature, The Witch. Yet The Northman feels more like the movie Glenn Danzig would’ve made if Glenn Danzig was the Danzig of Misfits fans’ imagination (rather than a sort of goth Tommy Wiseau).  The Northman is Shakespeare, but it’s also a movie about muscular shirtless men growling at each other. For me, it was near to perfect. “The director of The Witch made a Norwegian black metal Hamlet starring Alexander Skarsgard” is the kind of simple declarative sentence that functions as the rave it’s intended to be. This is a movie in which a seer tells Amleth that he will one day have to choose between love of his kin and hate for his enemies. Because this is a Robert Eggers movie, you can practically hear Danzig bellowing “I CHOOOOSE HAAAAAAAATE” over chugging power chords. The Northman is a beautiful goth fantasy, not a fairy tale, and logic will always take a backseat to lurid violence and operatic conflict. Skarsgard’s Amleth… well, he’s kind of an intense guy. In the opening frame, adolescent Amleth greets his father (Ethan Hawke), returning from battle. A ghoulish jester/prophet played by Willem Dafoe (absolutely as great as that collection of words would suggest) takes them deep into a cave for some kind of ceremony where they pretend to be wolves. Ethan Hawke burps. Young Amleth farts. Success! But just when they’re about to really get their dog-man on, Amleth’s uncle, officially listed on IMDB as “Fjolnir the Brotherless” (Claes Bang) murders Amleth’s father and carries off his mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman).  Young Amleth escapes his attackers (gorily, somehow), hops in a boat, and rows seemingly straight out to sea. With every stroke he repeats his vow to kill his uncle, avenge his father, and save his mother, like an Arya Stark incantation.  We skip from there straight to adult Amleth, living in the land of Rus and carrying on the various family traditions: raping, pillaging, shirtlessness, bellowing. He’s graduated from wolf cub to bear, belonging to a pillaging troupe who growl like bears before sacking mud-caked villages (God, so much mud). According to Eggers, there’s nothing 8th-century Vikings liked more than taking psychedelic drugs and growling like animals (looking like a sort of Scandinavian equivalent of the Haka). Northman presents the BERSERKER legend at its most stylized. (It should be noted that both berserker, “bear warriors,” and úlfhéðnar, “wolf warriors,” are ideas taken directly from history).  Upon discovering that Fjolnir the Brotherless has emigrated to Iceland, Amleth disguises himself as a slave, complete with branded skin, in order to gain passage. Did I mention Amleth is kind of intense? He willingly gives up his status as a prominent bear warrior to become the lowliest of the low, a slave, just so that he can murder a dude who has already been exiled to a barren wasteland. This is exactly the kind of guy whose contemporary ancestors heard English heavy metal and didn’t realize the satanic thing was a bit, so they invented Norwegian black metal and started burning down churches and killing each other. On the slow boat to Iceland, Amleth meets a Slavic witch (“Olga of the Birch Forest,” played by Anya Taylor-Joy). The two kind of hit it off, and thus, all the pieces for Amleth’s big choice between family and vengeance are in place. The reason I love Robert Eggers is that he tells stories in such a way that the fantastic is real. The characters in The Witch and The Northman don’t battle spirits and demons and have prophetic drug-fueled visions because Eggers is taking liberties, they do these things because that’s how people in the 8th and 16th centuries genuinely understood their world. For them, the fantastic was reality. That’s how Eggers treats it, and if we the audience get to live deliciously in the process, so much the better. The Northman is one of the few movies I’ve seen in which the Shakespearian style of operatic plotting, with characters whose choices are meant to evoke the poles of human nature and ring of universal truth, actually works. That’s largely because Eggers’ vision is so unabashedly extreme and fully realized that it works as spectacle even when the characters behave more like ancient legends than people (and I suspect this is exactly how Shakespeare’s plays were intended to function)."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE,"The film's extreme violence, ambiguous moral stance and delve into supernatural folklore might alienate certain viewers, but this ranks alongside other great revenge epics such as Gladiator in terms of sheer excitement and spectacle."
"Apr 14, 2022",POSITIVE," Two movies are at war within The Northman, the latest film from The Witch and The Lighthouse director Robert Eggers. The first is a fascinating, trance-like sensory experience that envelops you in the first half hour. The second is a historical revenge saga that feels much more straightforward — in its presentation, rather than in what actually unfolds — while also feeling hesitant in its depictions of violence and sensuality. Despite veering between these two modes of expression (one much more effective than the other), Eggers’ film still ends up on the right side of enjoyable, especially when taking into account that major Hollywood studios (in this case, Universal and its subsidiary Focus Features) so rarely distribute this kind of story — even the relatively neutered version that ends up on screen. The tale, on paper, is a simple one. After witnessing his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), being betrayed and murdered by his ruthless uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), the Viking warrior prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) returns many years later, in the guise of a slave, to quench his thirst for revenge and to rescue his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). However, The Northman works best when plot momentum is an afterthought, and when it luxuriates in the smoky, shadowy atmosphere created by Eggers and his collaborators. Fjölnir’s betrayal, rather than a mere detail nestled a truncated prologue, arrives instead at the tail-end of a lengthy section (one of several chapters with its own on-screen title), in which the characters are established in broad strokes, in which a young Amleth (played by Oscar Novak) is initiated into his royal lineage, and in which the film’s themes of premonition and destiny come rushing to the fore. The music, by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough, is absolutely key, veering between folk-like strings that evoke King Aurvandill’s regality as he returns from war, and percussions so heavy — during murkier and more spiritual segments — that with the right theatrical sound system, the bass is sure to rattle your ribcage. An early scene, featuring Willem Dafoe in his all-too-brief appearance as a jester-like shaman, sees both Aurvandill and Amleth embodying hounds as they traipse around a fire on all fours, howling as they tap into animalistic instincts that exists side-by-side with vivid hallucinations of their distinguished ancestors. It’s just one of several such sequences where Carolan and Gainsborough’s thundering score might make you want to beat your chest and join in with an on-screen ritual (it certainly helps that Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography, awash in deep shadows and flickering flames, is just as eerie as it is inviting). That sense of ritualism permeates the rest of the story. As a young Amleth escapes his uncle’s clutches, he begins repeating the phrase “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir” to himself over and over again, even as an adult, until it becomes a holy mantra. This mission, however, ends up becoming morally complicated thanks to certain surprising specifics as the story unfolds. By the time these complications arise, the very notion of bloodshed — seemingly righteous bloodshed, in particular — takes on a spiritual bent. As various moon-lit visions compel Amleth to retrieve a mythical saber for his quest, the long and vengeful path laid out before him becomes entwined with the notions of royal destiny in the film’s early stages, and before long, even violence becomes its own form of twisted ritual. While The Northman’s magnificent, dream-like sequences feel plucked out of time, its more traditional scenes in the back half tend to struggle. They don’t take up too much of the initial 30 minutes, but once the plot is set in motion, and the adult Amleth begins his journey — after much time spent as a violent plunderer, amongst a group of raiders who mold themselves after wolves and bears, leading to even more inviting scenes of primal revelry — the film then begins to settle into a more standard Hollywood narrative. This isn’t inherently a problem, especially since the romantic element it introduces also features a mystical bent (Anya Taylor-Joy plays Olga, a fellow slave whose beliefs in the occult, and whose prayers invoking natural forces, pair well with Amleth’s bloodthirsty disposition). However, when the story starts presenting less through shadows, music, body-language, and dreams, and more through dialogue, the film’s weaknesses as classical drama begin to pile up. Across the nearly 140-minute runtime, too many exchanges feel hastily assembled and poorly constructed, with little thought for relationships or rhythm. Eggers is at his best when he bucks tradition, like when he dislodges his camera from moments of standard, over-the-shoulder coverage, and opts instead to move in to isolated close-ups where the characters practically address the audience (it often feels, in these moments, like they’re peering into their own souls as the camera floats towards them). In contrast, the blocking when characters exchange words feels stilted, with an eye towards plot-function rather than feeling, and the rote cuts that follow them line by line feel distinctly uninspired. There isn’t always something off-kilter about the construction of these scenes, but for a film whose most impactful moments play like haunting vignettes from early silent cinema (perhaps even more so than Eggers’ 4:3 black-and-white production The Lighthouse), the frequent returns to editing for continuity, and staging for dialogue in a plainly logistical sense, suck the air out of the room. Some of these more traditional moments unfold in long takes, and they largely manage to hold attention, but when they’re deployed for action scenes, the film’s shortcomings as a specifically Hollywood production also become apparent. The Northman has plenty of viciousness unfolding in its margins, especially as a tale whose “hero” is just as merciless as its villains. But too many of these instances feel bloodless, despite the frequent stabbings and dismemberments; so much of the violence is implied, just off-screen, but little of it is felt. The film’s nudity and sexuality feel just as dulled. In either case, the camera captures bodies at their most vulnerable — whether in moments of passion or bloodshed — but only briefly, before cutting away. It's a good thing the performances manage to reflect at least some of these ideas, concerned with the line between violence and passion, even if The Northman hesitates to ruminate on them in a meaningful aesthetic sense. Skarsgård, for instance, feels genuinely torn between his divinely inspired plans for vengeance and his newfound lust and affection for Olga. Bang, meanwhile, is simultaneously the most muted performer and the most alluring, using his silence to introduce hidden, thoughtful layers to Fjölnir that only serve to complicate Amleth’s single-minded ambition. Kidman especially keeps the film afloat when it leaves the more ethereal scenes behind, and she’s even at the center of the rare dialogue exchange that feels genuinely visceral and nauseating, as she taps into some delightfully unsettling instincts. And of course, mention must be made of Fjölnir’s indignant heir Thórir (Gustav Lindh), a minor character, but one whose detestable presence makes him the most punchable cinematic fail-son since Iosef in John Wick. Despite its less effective elements growing increasingly prominent, The Northman maintains a sense of possibility, and unpredictability, thanks to the spiritual notions at its core. Whatever Amleth learns or unlearns, or experiences in the flesh — whatever gentleness compels him, on a human level, to veer from his vengeful path — sits right alongside his mad visions of glory, and his desire to fulfill a self-destructive destiny in a way that ultimately makes The Northman a tragedy. It is, however, a particularly picturesque tragedy that, in its most effective moments, sweeps you up in pulsating fire-side customs awash in beating drums that emanate as if from Valhalla itself. That’s worth occasionally tolerating scenes that feel run-of-the-mill by comparison. Robert Eggers’ viking revenge saga The Northman works best when it dives head-first into dreams and disorienting visions, but it slows down when it becomes a more traditional Hollywood narrative. With viciousness relegated to its margins, it often feels neutered and bloodless, but still ends up on the right side of entertaining thanks to its pulsating music and measured performances. "
"Apr 13, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman (Alexander Skarsgard) father, the king, is murdered and he swears to avenge him and save his mother. That’s the story. The beauty of this film isn’t the story but the visual feast for the eyes, the direction, cinematography, editing and the world created by the co-writer and director, Robert Eggers. Even though this is testosterone filled movie, the female characters are complex and fully formed!! Björk as the witch is inspired casting and she savours every moment of screen time given. However, Nicole Kidman as the queen and mother takes as into the gates of hell. It is an award worthy performance for sure. All I will say is that there’s a scene between her and her son that actually took my breath away. She owns every single frame she appears in. Prince Amleth is on the verge of becoming a man when his father is brutally murdered by his uncle, who kidnaps the boy’s mother. Two decades later, Amleth is now a Viking who raids Slavic villages. He soon meets a seeress who reminds him of his vow — save his mother, kill his uncle, avenge his father. After his father, the King (Ethan Hawke), is murdered by his brother (Claes Bang), a Viking prince named Amleth escapes his kingdom, vowing to return and take revenge. Years later, the now hulking Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) discovers his murderous uncle lost his kingdom and is now a feudal lord. Amleth poses as a slave to take his revenge but must decide what to do about his mother (Nicole Kidman) and young half-brother. We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Apr 13, 2022",NEGATIVE," After partaking in a ritual that binds him as his father King Aurvandil’s (Ethan Hawke) loyal protector and successor, young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, ""The Batman's"" young Bruce Wayne) is horrified to see him not only betrayed, but decapitated by his uncle, the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, ""The Square"").  Barely escaping while vowing ‘I will avenge you father. I will save you mother.  I will kill you Fjölnir,’ we next see Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as a muscle-bound wolf-bear hybrid Viking beserker who is reminded of his vow by a seeress (Björk) in “The Northman.” After partaking in a ritual that binds him as his father King Aurvandil’s (Ethan Hawke) loyal protector and successor, young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, ""The Batman's"" young Bruce Wayne) is horrified to see him not only betrayed, but decapitated by his uncle, the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, ""The Square"").  Barely escaping while vowing ‘I will avenge you father.

The problem is two-fold.  Firstly, this is a straight-out revenge tale but the disconnect between the young Amleth and The Northman he becomes is such that the latter’s ultimate victory feels deserved but hollow, drained of the emotion the younger actor brings to the screen.  Secondly there is less of that distinctive Eggers otherwordliness, relegated here to a tree of royal lineage spun by some supernatural weavers, the mound-dwelling Warrior King from whom Amleth must wrench his sword and Amleth’s final ascent into the heavens.
While Hamlet’s mother was complicit in the murder of his father, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) is carried away screaming, hence Amleth’s vow to save her.  The brawny beserker learns that Fjölnir lost Aurvandil’s island of Hrafnsey to a Norse king and has become a farmer in Iceland, and so he slips from his ‘wolf pack’ to travel there in a boat disguised among a group of slaves.  These include Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy, ""The Witch""), who will become his ally and lover. 
Inspecting the shackled slaves, Fjölnir declares them unworthy, ordering them to be sold, until Amleth makes a bid for attention and is kept.  His half brother Gunnar (Elliott Rose) declares his mother’s need for a laundress and kitchen help and Olga, too, is chosen.  Amleth bides his time, observing his mother from afar, convinced she is playacting out of love for her second child with Fjölnir, but soon begins to strike in the dead of night (his sword may only be unsheathed ‘at night or at the gates of hell’), causing fear on the farm.  He himself is beyond suspicion, having saved Gunnar during a game of Knattleikr (which looks like field hockey as death sport).  But after slaying Fjölnir’s eldest son Thorír (Gustav Lindh, ""Queen of Hearts""), he reveals himself to his mother.  Her response is unexpected on multiple levels.
The film can be quite gory, Amleth dismembering bodies and spilling intestines, Finnr The Nose-Stub (Eldar Skar) so named because of his youthful getaway ploy, but it is not as gruesome as expected, most of his barbarism viewed in its aftermath.   Production and costume designers Craig Lathrop and Linda Muir convince of authenticity, their work organic to its landscape.  Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke’s work is stunning, whether intricately following the logistics of Viking pillaging or following Amleth’s catlike movements onto a thatched roof beneath a sky full of stars.  Music by Robin Carolin and Sebastian Gainsborough balances weighty themes with ethereal flourishes, performed with wind and instruments from Viking times.
The cast I found to be far more effective in the film’s first part, Hawke, Novak and Kidman creating a close family unit made formal by weight of responsibility.  Skarsgård is physically jaw-dropping here, but his Amleth is a single-minded beast only slightly softened in interactions with Taylor-Joy, whose accent is iffy and speech is stilted.  Bang is fine, displaying a range I was beginning to question.  Always a plus, Willem Dafoe (""The Lighthouse"") is Aurvandil’s court jester Heimir, this film’s version of Hamlet’s Yorick, reappearing as a talking skull.  “The Witch’s” Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson can be seen as Fjölnir’s housekeeper and a boat captain.

The king (Ethan Hawke) returns home after a great victory accompanied by his brother (Claes Bang). But, there is deceit afoot and regicide is committed. The king’s young son flees for his life and vows vengeance against his father’s murderer, no matter how long it may take, for “The Northman.” Director Robert Eggers made his feature film debut with an impressive splash with “The Witch (2015),” a wonderfully atmospheric horror story. He followed the debut with “The Lighthouse (2019),” an equally atmospheric horror movie but the horror is in the minds of the players. With “The Northman,” he eschews horror (sort of) with a study of carnage and revenge in 897 AD northern Europe. Following his harrowing escape from his father’s murderers, young Amleth (Oscar Novak) vows revenge and sets off to fulfill this destiny. Years later, he (Alexander Skarsgard) is all grown up and a trained warrior, ready to complete his vow. This begins the tale of revenge that is not as straightforward as it might be. Robert Eggers, well known for his attention to historical detail, does bring us a Nordic saga with elements of magic. But, the bulk of the film is about brute force and its use in smiting your enemies. Here, Alexander Skarsgard fits the bill, all pumped up on steroids (it seems), and dispatches his opponents with bloody brutality. Unfortunately, when it comes time to emote, and not hack away, he falls short, performing mostly with grunts."
"Apr 13, 2022",POSITIVE," “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” The eponymous character repeats this mantra from childhood, immediately after witnessing tragedy, well into adulthood. It focuses his primal rage, directing his hate and tying his fate to a singular mission of revenge. The Northman remains so steadfast in its commitment to vengeance through punishing violence, gritty authenticity, mesmerizing style, and mysticism that many of its more fascinating themes get lost on the journey. Alexander Skarsgård stars as Amleth, the son of War-Raven King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). As a child, Amleth barely escapes with his life and flees into the sea after witnessing his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) murder his father and claim his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), as his wife. Years later, Amleth’s assimilation into a marauding clan directs his deep-seated fury into pillaging and combat until a Seeress (Björk) hauntingly reminds him of his vows. Now of an age to fulfill them, Amleth sets off on a blood-drenched quest to fulfill his destiny. Director Robert Eggers, who co-wrote The Northman with Sjón (Lamb), again displays a meticulously researched vision that ambiguously blurs the lines between realism and the supernatural. This is a feral world where Viking warriors aspire to die on the battlefield, where growing old is perceived as less honorable. They hope that Valkyries will come to carry them to Valhalla upon death and evoke the spirit of wolves around the fire before battle. They turn to shamans and seers to perform strange magic to determine their fates. It’s a savage, unforgiving setting full of mud, entrails, and brute force; kill or be killed at best or be enslaved at worst. The precise type of harsh world that hardens its youth at a far too early age. This detailed vision and heightened scope make Eggers’ latest so impressive. The breathtaking tracking shots that follow Amleth post-battle, capturing the chaos and spoils of war behind him as he slips through the mud between huts, convey so much visually about this world and its characters. The rhythmic pulse of beating drums and guttural screams add to the tactile, sensory experience. The purposeful but brutal violence meted out at every step of Amleth’s mission won’t be for the weak-stomached. All of it creates a detailed and rich tapestry of Viking life. Beyond that, though, Eggers keeps Amleth’s journey so straightforward that many of the more interesting components remain shallow throughout. There’s a futility to Amleth’s vengeance, causing his drive to lose steam by the climax. An awe-inducing final confrontation creates a stunning spectacle that ultimately rings empty. How women factor into this cruel world creates another untaken path; Anya Taylor-Joy‘s Olga makes for a unique character that becomes solely defined by her relationship with Amleth. Eggers never examines how her witchcraft factors into the culture beyond superficial purposes. Kidman’s character, though brief, fares much more substantial for more obvious reasons; the legend of Amleth is a direct inspiration to Shakespeare’s Hamlet, after all. Eggers’ commitment to maintaining the accuracy of the period and the influences makes for a visual feast but binds it narratively. That dedication extends to the cast, delivering solid performances that immerse you in this testosterone-driven world. The raw emotion and range in Bang’s Fjölnir stand out among the rest. But the undeterred straight-line coursing through this action epic means that it doesn’t resonate as strongly as Eggers’ previous efforts. The beating heart of The Northman is a familiar tale of revenge, but in Eggers’ hands, it’s at least deeply engrossing. Horror journalist, RT Top Critic, and Critics Choice Association member.

Officially announced by Blumhouse and Lionsgate earlier this month, a reboot of The Blair Witch Project is currently in the works, which will be the third follow-up to the original found footage horror classic that changed the game back in 1999. In the wake of the announcement, the original creators and stars have each issued joint statements this weekend. The Blair Witch Project was created by filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez – along with Haxan Films creative partners Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie and Michael Monello – back in the 1990s, with stars Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard heading out into the woods of Maryland to conjure up horror magic together. The actors largely improvised their performances and even used their real names in the movie, with the film’s clever viral marketing campaign leading many to believe that they weren’t actually actors in a movie, but rather real people who truly went missing out in the woods. All this to say, Donahue, Williams and Leonard are collectively a huge part of why The Blair Witch Project became a pop culture phenomenon, and all these years later they’re looking for some recognition from Lionsgate, the current rights holders of the iconic property. As Joshua Leonard first explained in a Facebook post on April 11, “I’m so proud of our little punk-rock movie, and I LOVE the fans who keep the flames burning. But at this point, it’s 25 years of disrespect from the folks who’ve pocketed the lion’s share (pun intended) of the profits from OUR work, and that feels both icky and classless.” 1. Retroactive + future residual payments to Heather, Michael and Josh for acting services rendered in the original BWP, equivalent to the sum that would’ve been allotted through SAG-AFTRA, had we had proper union or legal representation when the film was made. 2. Meaningful consultation on any future Blair Witch reboot, sequel, prequel, toy, game, ride, escape room, etc… , in which one could reasonably assume that Heather, Michael & Josh’s names and/or likenesses will be associated for promotional purposes in the public sphere. Note: Our film has now been rebooted twice, both times were a disappointment from a fan/box office/critical perspective. Neither of these films were made with significant creative input from the original team. As the insiders who created the Blair Witch and have been listening to what fans love & want for 25 years, we’re your single greatest, yet thus-far unutilized secret-weapon! 3. “The Blair Witch Grant”: A 60k grant (the budget of our original movie), paid out yearly by Lionsgate, to an unknown/aspiring genre filmmaker to assist in making their first feature film. This is a GRANT, not a development fund, hence Lionsgate will not own any of the underlying rights to the project. “As we near the 25th anniversary of The Blair Witch Project, our pride in the storyworld we created and the film we produced is reaffirmed by the recent announcement of a reboot by horror icons Jason Blum and James Wan. “While we, the original filmmakers, respect Lionsgate’s right to monetize the intellectual property as it sees fit, we must highlight the significant contributions of the original cast — Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. As the literal faces of what has become a franchise, their likenesses, voices, and real names are inseparably tied to The Blair Witch Project. Their unique contributions not only defined the film’s authenticity but continue to resonate with audiences around the world. If you’d like to support the cause, sharing and amplifying is the way to go. You’ll find the original post for Heather, Michael and Josh’s statement below, which can be shared to your feed."
"Apr 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"Eggers treats the big screen reverently, like the last one he will ever get to make a film for."
"Apr 13, 2022",POSITIVE," There’s a touch of Tolkien to Robert Eggers’ latest, from mythical swords and entwined destinies to a final battle in the heart of a raging volcano. This isn’t a surprise, given Tolkien’s love for Norse mythology, and unsurprising too is the film’s passing resemblance to Ridley Scott’s revenge-fuelled Gladiator. But to compare The Northman to films past is to do it a disservice. Eggers’ tale of brutal, Viking revenge stands alone, thrashing around in a phantasmagoric blur of rituals, bloodshed and mythology. Even if the story may feel well-worn, its execution is bold, visually expansive, and largely triumphant. The story begins with the young prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) relishing in the return of his all-conquering father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and battle-hardened uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). It’s no real spoiler to say this happiness does not last, and Amleth is soon forced to flee for his life, leaving behind his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), and cursing the name of the man who has ripped apart his happy childhood. Flash-forward twenty or so years, and Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is now a berserker, scouring the Lands of the Rus (modern-day Eastern Europe), taking lives, towns and trophies. Yet when the opportunity to exact revenge presents itself, the king without a country leaves this behind and heads to Iceland an enslaved stowaway, alongside the prickly Olga (Anna Taylor-Joy). It’s a simple and predictable premise, but the thrill of The Northman comes from the fantastical and wildly bombastic elements which Eggers throws into the narrative. Even the real-world locations are dripping with drama and character, with the black beaches, rolling green hills and portentous peaks all adding to Eggers’ otherworldly canvass. In his pursuit of something approaching historical accuracy, the director decides to fill the screen with Norse folklore and mysticism, from the presence of the Valkyrie through to hallucinogenic rituals. In doing so, he creates a ‘Viking’ world as they themselves may have perceived it, unmarred with the pressure of modern-day revisionism or scepticism. All of this, too, is enmeshed in Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s thunderous and unrelenting score, which pins you to your chair as Skarsgård exacts his bloody revenge. As the titular character, Skarsgård is sublime. Even when the words he has to speak verge on the stilted, his stalking physicality is utterly convincing. Bang and Taylor-Joy deserve plaudits too, with the latter wholly selling Olga’s connection with a deeper world of magic and mysticism. In its pursuit of these aggressively bold strokes, The Northman is almost overwhelming at points, and could have benefitted from a sharper edit in the second act to maintain its demented momentum (there are also a lot of guttural ululations and rituals). But to nitpick seems churlish when the scope is so grand and the ambition so unbowed. Perhaps the only chink in its armour is that, while Amleth is told he will soon have to choose between love for his kin and hatred for his enemies, his eventual answer never appears in doubt. To some extent, the narrative is secondary, with primacy very much given to spectacle, and when it comes crashing together, The Northman’s euphoric viciousness is staggering. See it on the biggest screen possible."
"Apr 13, 2022",POSITIVE," Gather round: it’s time for another of Robert Eggers’ immersive and slightly loopy historical/mythic dioramas, and this time out it’s The Northman, a tale of Viking revenge based loosely on Hamlet. What Eggers has delivered is a relatively epic and unsurprisingly ambitious exercise that’s loaded with some tremendous imagery, his trademark detail, and grisly violence, yet somehow feels unduly restrained. Young prince Amleth and his mother Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) welcome home King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) from his latest campaign of whatever it is Vikings campaign at. It’s not long though before Aurvandil’s bastard brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang) decides he wants the throne for himself. He assassinates the king and kidnaps Gudrun. Amleth escapes, swearing his revenge, and years later (now played by Alexander Skarsgard) he’s become some kind of berserker raider running around pillaging villages and capturing slaves while in a wolf-trance. When he overhears that a clutch of slaves are set to be delivered to Fjolnir, who himself has now been stripped of his title and is merely a wealthy farmer, he disguises himself as one of the slaves and goes undercover for vengeance. The Northman is absolutely chock-full of Eggers’ patented detail; everything glistens with authenticity, from the costumes to the boats to the architecture. The script, beyond its bare-bones origins in Shakespeare, draws heavily from Norse myth and is loaded with its iconography. It’s also absolutely gorgeous, gliding over all this production design with largely symmetrical compositions that, along with endless beautiful location work, make this a hypnodrome for the ages. But it still feels like Eggers is holding back, if you can even imagine such a thing. What’s here is certainly a blast, but it’s perhaps not productively about anything; we’re in simple revenge-movie mode, despite the lush milieu. And that’s perfectly fine, but despite the gnarly violence of terrific action sequences — like an early village raid or a climactic swordfight on an exploding volcano or repeated images of a witch played by Bjork hissing poetry at Amleth — The Northman never really kicks over into the dementedly beautiful, shockingly violent phantasmagoria of, say, John Boorman’s Excalibur, by which it is very clearly inspired. Or for further comparison points, look to Nic Refn’s Valhalla Rising, which managed to be significantly weirder with about 1/15th of the budget and research. Still, virtually nobody else is getting a check written to commit their undeniable vision to the screen the way Eggers does, and even a somewhat muted version of that vision is worth celebrating."
"Apr 13, 2022",NEUTRAL," The Vikings of Robert Eggers’ beautiful, otherworldly, and savage new film The Northman are not the kind of people you would want to be neighbors with. They settle most disagreements with edged weapons, massacre with abandon, take life advice from mad fools and visions, and don’t seem able to play a simple game without somebody getting their skull cracked open like an egg. Also, when things get rough, they resort to human sacrifice. And the pillaging. Dear God, the pillaging. Instead, we have Alexander Skarsgård. Never the most expressive performer, he is at his best when able to bring a twinkle of ironic mischief, as he did with his cynically bemused soldier in the 2008 miniseries, Generation Kill, or the trollish tech mogul in 2018’s Succession. Here he plays Amleth, a 10th Century Viking prince whose father King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) was murdered by his half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Given that backstory, Amleth is a pretty morose sort whose inner depths are rarely hinted at by Skarsgard’s hulking, animalistic take.  Amleth is not the kind of Viking who pillages and then happily celebrates with a tankard of mead and a rousing sing-song. He is more likely to butcher everyone he lays eyes on and then scowl in the dark for a while, plotting how to take revenge on Fjölnir and save his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). It’s a savagely committed disposition but a relatively shallow one that becomes less rather than more engaging as the film progresses. If Amleth’s name and the plot sound familiar, that is because Eggers and his co-author, Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, based it on the Scandinavian legend that inspired Hamlet. Unlike Shakespeare’s angsty protagonist, Amleth knows what he wants to do. In a gripping scene that ends the film’s first section, a traumatized young Amleth (Oscar Novak) rows into the North Sea after seeing Aurvandil’s murder and repeats the metronomic mantra that carries him through the rest of the film: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” While Hamlet can plot in peace while never having to leave Elsinore palace, Amleth the onetime cheerful innocent princeling falls in with a band of marauding Vikings and has to adjust. Once the film catches up with adult Amleth, he is a kind of ravening beast with only a burning cinder where his heart should be. In one of the film’s most indelible sequences, Amleth and his fellow Vikings sack a Slavic village. Amleth cuts down every man in sight while his comrades round up survivors they will force into slavery, and massacre the rest. Herding children they deem unsellable into a hut, they set it on fire. Inured to such horrors, Amleth only comes alive when he happens to hear some captives are being sold to Fjölnir. He steals away in their boat and finds himself working for his father’s slayer. Having lost Aurvandil’s realm to another king, Fjölnir is now a lowly chieftain in as-yet unsettled Iceland, Gudrún still at his side. Neither recognizes Amleth or understands the danger they have purchased. Amleth starts a guerrilla campaign, killing Fjölnir’s men night after night and building slowly to the titanic confrontation that the epic landscape and portentous dialogue suggests is all but inevitable. A revenge thriller with an elevated horror heart and an anthropologist’s eye for detail and ritual, The Northman is a witchy and weird piece of work. But despite the layered imagination that went into recreating this ancient world, it is still the most conventional work yet from Eggers, director of old-time Americana oddities The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019). The Northman features operatic scope and magical imagery that will be burned into your retinas for quite some time. Eggers blurs the line between fantasy and reality in a way that recalls Macbeth more than Hamlet, using a series of seers (including one played in gloriously sinister fashion by Björk in a black headdress that seems perfect for a “This Mortal Coil” music video) to direct the increasingly frantic Amleth on his trajectory of vengeance. As often happens, though, tales of men with nothing but revenge on their minds become tiresome. Eggers seems to know this. He packs the film with fantastical scenes that paint in the Viking worldview, from hallucinatory visions of Yggdrasil (the “world tree”, festooned here with corpses) and pale-faced shrieking Valkyries bringing the heroic dead to Valhalla. There are also choreographed funeral ceremonies and fireside dances that turn warriors into ravening berserkers. The Northman is viciously anti-romantic. The Vikings are depicted throughout as remorseless and reflexive murderers—in one of the film’s most quietly effective scenes, we see a Viking on a longboat casually using his bow to kill a man and boy fishing nearby, chuckling to himself. But Eggers nevertheless shows them as a fully formed civilization. As amoral as they seem, the Vikings see other people as uncivilized brutes, and at one point a man rages about the “Christian savages whose god is a corpse, nailed to a tree.” But despite all that, the story at the film’s core rarely rises above the mundane. Amleth is depicted as a man so devoid of spirit, he fails to generate interest. Far more riveting are the women. Olga (Anna Taylor-Joy), a Slavic woman sold to Fjölnir who takes a romantic shine to Amleth, has a sorceress’ wiliness about her that fascinates, particularly in comparison to all the brutishness around her. When she realizes Fjölnir is about to rape her, she fends him off by swiping menstrual blood across his face; it’s a simple yet brilliant maneuver that few of the men in the film would understand because it does not involve burying a hatchet in someone.  For her part, Kidman spends most of the film playing Gudrún as a dutiful wife. But she unveils the fallen queen’s stiletto-sharp cunning in a head-spinning scene where the tables are turned on Amleth and he has to consider whether his life has been a lie. If the film dared to follow through on the possibilities posed by that moment, its story might have matched the bravura originality of its mythic spirit and sensual visuals. With The Northman, Eggers has made great progress towards wresting the public imagination of Vikings closer to their lived historical reality. But doing so without making the film a remotely human story makes that accomplishment a pyrrhic victory. "
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," By the time the sumptuous and gnarly Viking revenge odyssey The Northman arrives at its “Gates of Hell” finale—a stupendously composed scene in which two bare, beastly and bloodthirsty men lunge and growl at each other on the skirts of an active volcano—you might wonder how many movies you have already watched to get to that point in director Robert Eggers’ violence-soaked fever dream. The answer is too many to count. In other words, The Northman is an unapologetic, non-stop adventure that dispenses everything, everywhere, all at once. From Icelandic family sagas to Norse legends to supernatural myths, Eggers plays with the rich material at his disposal with a wide-eyed enthusiasm that’s both disarming and awe-inspiring. His approach feels a little bit like he knows it’s his one and only shot to make a film that should—or at least could—become one of the greatest examples of its kind, a Shakespearean drama wrapped in Old Norse vengeance. He evidences this laudable (if not overeager) commitment in every detail of the 136-minute epic, including spilled guts, sliced up human flesh, and spliced corpses, as well as an animalistic performance by Swedish heartthrob Alexander Skarsgård, who beefed up his muscle mass to play the merciless, score-settling Prince Amleth. As a child in the fictitious island kingdom of Hrafnsey, Amleth’s warrior king father Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke, in a short but memorable part) inaugurates his son as his tribe’s future ruler in a psychedelic ceremony witnessed by the mad-eyed Heimir the Fool (a delirious Willem Dafoe). Amleth’s uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) soon murders his father and kidnaps his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, in an increasingly substantial part of escalating wrath). But by the time Amleth becomes an adult, he has long forgotten his vow to avenge his father and rescue his mother, consumed instead by wreaking havoc on defenseless Slavic villages as a Viking. It’s eventually the prophet Seeress (Björk, making her first non-Matthew Barney-related appearance on screen since Dancer In The Dark) who reminds Amleth of his familial mission, prompting him to blend in with Slavic slaves on the ship where he meets his romantic and intellectual match, the stonily alluring Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). After the film’s single moment of quiet—a gleamingly lensed coital scene between him and Olga—Amleth invades his uncle’s farm and begins to uncover deeper truths behind his father’s murder. A sequence of high-octane drama ensues between mother and son, as Kidman and Skarsgård stage the most bizarre Big Little Lies reunion imaginable. At least from an ambition standpoint, Eggers’ devotion pays off in heaps.  The Northman offers a lot to enjoy in what is a lot of movie. It features both see-it-to-believe-it “fuck yeah!” gruesomeness in its 10th Century tale and the kind of historical and mythical attention to detail to be expected from Eggers, the A24-endorsed, indie genre virtuoso of The Witch and The Lighthouse as he plays in a $90 million sandbox for the first time. Regardless of its financial returns, that price tag on a fiercely original film feels like good news in an industry that too frequently only opens its purse to spandex-clad superheroes and pre-existing IP. This fact alone makes The Northman a  rarity worth embracing, even if Eggers’ third feature—arguably his most “commercial” one yet—doesn’t strike  an emotional chord as clear as the atmospherically insidious The Witch or The Lighthouse’s claustrophobic madness. Here, he conceals the film’s beating heart beneath returning Eggers collaborator Craig Lathrop’s primordial, meticulously textured production design and Jarin Blaschke’s hallucinogenic cinematography, the anything-but-raw materials that repeatedly produce impeccably choreographed set pieces constructed shot in unflinchingly long takes. By comparison, the simplistic script by Eggers and Swedish poet and writer Sjón (Lamb) avoids going too deeply into its characters’ untamed urges while its story taps the same well  that Shakespeare drew from for Hamlet. What also doesn’t help is Eggers’ unwavering, full-throttle maximalism, an approach that unflatteringly dovetails into two additional otherwise first-rate films currently in theaters: Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert’s aforementioned multiverse family caper Everything Everywhere All At Once and  Michael Bay’s old-school action flick Ambulance. One wonders if this trend toward cinematic excess is  an artistic act of disobedience against the sameness of corporate franchises, or simply a response to two-plus years of filmmakers (much less audiences) being cooped up in their homes. Regardless, The Northman is still a lot of fun scene by scene, even without a strong through line connecting them all. Though lacking a well-realized emotional register, the film achieves an elemental, opulent vibe that splits the difference between Braveheart and Gladiator, or maybe The Revenant and The Lion King. Meanwhile, Eggers and Sjón infuse the dialogue with a light, giggly touch that leavens the film’s heavy visuals with self-conscious humor.  Consequently, Eggers’ immersive approach and stylistic flair creates one wild, applause-worthy combat scene after another, reminding viewers why he’s one of the most unique visual artists working today. While The Northman isn’t his best film, it’s probably his most, putting absolutely everything on screen at the biggest scale to tell the most brutal, and beautiful, story possible. "
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Revenge is a dish best served cold, and it doesn’t get any colder, literally or figuratively, than the bitter portion ladled up in Robert Eggers’ merciless yarn of medieval vengeance, The Northman. This seriously nasty and violent tale comes across as an intense labor of love on the part of the American director and his Icelandic co-writer, the poet Sjón; there’s scarcely a moment of softness, sentiment or relaxation here, just fierce and ferocious determination to fight and prevail in an unstintingly harsh environment. For the most part it’s an enthralling immersion in a forbidding time and place, enhanced by an immoderately attractive cast and saddled only by a dramatic sameness that settles in after a while and gradually diminishes the film’s impact. There haven’t been too many Viking movies, most likely because the time and place involved pretty seriously restrict the format to two things—sailing and marauding, and the more violent the better; Richard Fleischer’s 1958 The Vikings, which was very violent for its time, still stands tall in the mini-genre. The Northman most certainly delivers on the mayhem front, as even the most fanatical action fans will feel sated by the time the last sword is swung. All the same, there is a highbrow component here as well, since the instigating action is the murder of the father of Prince Amleth, the latter a figure who one day would be converted by a certain William Shakespeare into a fellow named Hamlet. The ferocious rigor with which Eggers approaches his work here won’t much surprise viewers of his first two features, The Witch (2015), which centered on a small religious community in 1630s New England, and The Lighthouse (2019), a stark black-and-white two-hander set on the Northeastern coast in the 1890s. Both of these small but bracing films comingle weirdness and intensity to unsettling effect. All the same, they are as appetizers to the new work, which draws upon known 12th century historical incidents to the extent possible but more notably devotes itself to creating a convincingly brutal portrait of a ferociously savage lifestyle which no government or religion could significantly moderate. The only recognizable entity is a clan presided over by King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), but this is very shortly gutted by the king’s murder at the hands of his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who spares Gudrún but spirits her away. Twenty years on, royal survivor Amleth (the handsome and ultra-buff Alexander Skarsgård) has become a fearsome Viking raider. But fate enters in the form of a seeress (Björk), who directs him to avenge his father by killing his uncle. And so a new campaign of violence is launched. From the get-go, it’s clear that Eggers means for his film to be one thing: ferocious. There are plenty of dangerous animals on the loose in the land, but none are as deadly and duplicitous as the human beings. All the same, The Northman is uncommonly rarified when it comes to creative matters. Although the film is in color, it somehow remains in the memory in black-and-white, or something close to it. Eggers and his cinematographer Jarin Blaschke alter the visual treatment here in all sorts of ways that would require multiple viewings to entirely chart; some scenes are saturated in color, but it’s often dialed down and occasionally bled of color entirely, depending upon the import and intent of the scenes. Beyond that, the long takes appear tremendously complicated and demanding, involving long, hand-held shots that encompass massive amounts of chaotic action with significant numbers of people, animals, weapons and inevitable chance occurrences that depend upon precision for their dramatic impact. The immersive, deep-dive style promotes a strong you-are-there feeling and greater-than-ordinary visceral reactions to the frequent violence. The technical achievements here belong to the current era, when so much more camera mobility is possible than it used to be. Nonetheless, if the chilling tone and visual starkness can be compared to anything, it might be to Ingmar Bergman’s then-scandalous 1960 rape drama The Virgin Spring. The churning, relentless movement of the film not inappropriately feels akin to that of a military campaign, which means that it does get bogged down at times in between victories, mostly in the final act. But heavily in its favor is the vital sense of a strange and distant time and place, a historical moment for which limited concrete records open the door for creative minds like Eggers’ to imaginatively fill in the blanks. Rugged Northern Ireland locations stand in splendidly for the harsh Scandinavian settings, and the production design by Craig Lathrop and costumes by Linda Muir also create significant impressions.

"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," After partaking in a ritual that binds him as his father King Aurvandil’s (Ethan Hawke) loyal protector and successor, young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, ""The Batman's"" young Bruce Wayne) is horrified to see him not only betrayed, but decapitated by his uncle, the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, ""The Square"").  Barely escaping while vowing ‘I will avenge you father. I will save you mother.  I will kill you Fjölnir,’ we next see Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as a muscle-bound wolf-bear hybrid Viking beserker who is reminded of his vow by a seeress (Björk) in “The Northman.” After partaking in a ritual that binds him as his father King Aurvandil’s (Ethan Hawke) loyal protector and successor, young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak, ""The Batman's"" young Bruce Wayne) is horrified to see him not only betrayed, but decapitated by his uncle, the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, ""The Square"").  Barely escaping while vowing ‘I will avenge you father. I will save you mother.  I will kill you Fjölnir,’ we next see Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as a muscle-bound wolf-bear hybrid Viking beserker who is reminded of his vow by a seeress (Björk) in “The Northman.” Cowriter (with Sjón, ""Lamb"")/director Robert Eggers (""The Witch"") is known the extensive research he does on his supernatural twists on historical accounts.  This time, he reaches back to the same Scandinavian legend which Shakespeare used for ‘Hamlet,’ but while the film’s craft is exemplary and its drama brutal, “The Northman” is not as memorable a film as Eggers’ prior two.  This critic recalls Nicolas Winding Refn's 2009 ""Valhalla Rising"" more fondly.
The problem is two-fold.  Firstly, this is a straight-out revenge tale but the disconnect between the young Amleth and The Northman he becomes is such that the latter’s ultimate victory feels deserved but hollow, drained of the emotion the younger actor brings to the screen.  Secondly there is less of that distinctive Eggers otherwordliness, relegated here to a tree of royal lineage spun by some supernatural weavers, the mound-dwelling Warrior King from whom Amleth must wrench his sword and Amleth’s final ascent into the heavens.
While Hamlet’s mother was complicit in the murder of his father, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) is carried away screaming, hence Amleth’s vow to save her.  The brawny beserker learns that Fjölnir lost Aurvandil’s island of Hrafnsey to a Norse king and has become a farmer in Iceland, and so he slips from his ‘wolf pack’ to travel there in a boat disguised among a group of slaves.  These include Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy, ""The Witch""), who will become his ally and lover. 
Inspecting the shackled slaves, Fjölnir declares them unworthy, ordering them to be sold, until Amleth makes a bid for attention and is kept.  His half brother Gunnar (Elliott Rose) declares his mother’s need for a laundress and kitchen help and Olga, too, is chosen.  Amleth bides his time, observing his mother from afar, convinced she is playacting out of love for her second child with Fjölnir, but soon begins to strike in the dead of night (his sword may only be unsheathed ‘at night or at the gates of hell’), causing fear on the farm.  He himself is beyond suspicion, having saved Gunnar during a game of Knattleikr (which looks like field hockey as death sport).  But after slaying Fjölnir’s eldest son Thorír (Gustav Lindh, ""Queen of Hearts""), he reveals himself to his mother.  Her response is unexpected on multiple levels.
The film can be quite gory, Amleth dismembering bodies and spilling intestines, Finnr The Nose-Stub (Eldar Skar) so named because of his youthful getaway ploy, but it is not as gruesome as expected, most of his barbarism viewed in its aftermath.   Production and costume designers Craig Lathrop and Linda Muir convince of authenticity, their work organic to its landscape.  Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke’s work is stunning, whether intricately following the logistics of Viking pillaging or following Amleth’s catlike movements onto a thatched roof beneath a sky full of stars.  Music by Robin Carolin and Sebastian Gainsborough balances weighty themes with ethereal flourishes, performed with wind and instruments from Viking times.
The cast I found to be far more effective in the film’s first part, Hawke, Novak and Kidman creating a close family unit made formal by weight of responsibility.  Skarsgård is physically jaw-dropping here, but his Amleth is a single-minded beast only slightly softened in interactions with Taylor-Joy, whose accent is iffy and speech is stilted.  Bang is fine, displaying a range I was beginning to question.  Always a plus, Willem Dafoe (""The Lighthouse"") is Aurvandil’s court jester Heimir, this film’s version of Hamlet’s Yorick, reappearing as a talking skull.  “The Witch’s” Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson can be seen as Fjölnir’s housekeeper and a boat captain.

The king (Ethan Hawke) returns home after a great victory accompanied by his brother (Claes Bang). But, there is deceit afoot and regicide is committed. The king’s young son flees for his life and vows vengeance against his father’s murderer, no matter how long it may take, for “The Northman.” Director Robert Eggers made his feature film debut with an impressive splash with “The Witch (2015),” a wonderfully atmospheric horror story. He followed the debut with “The Lighthouse (2019),” an equally atmospheric horror movie but the horror is in the minds of the players. With “The Northman,” he eschews horror (sort of) with a study of carnage and revenge in 897 AD northern Europe. Following his harrowing escape from his father’s murderers, young Amleth (Oscar Novak) vows revenge and sets off to fulfill this destiny. Years later, he (Alexander Skarsgard) is all grown up and a trained warrior, ready to complete his vow. This begins the tale of revenge that is not as straightforward as it might be. Robert Eggers, well known for his attention to historical detail, does bring us a Nordic saga with elements of magic. But, the bulk of the film is about brute force and its use in smiting your enemies. Here, Alexander Skarsgard fits the bill, all pumped up on steroids (it seems), and dispatches his opponents with bloody brutality. Unfortunately, when it comes time to emote, and not hack away, he falls short, performing mostly with grunts."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"  Robert Eggers has become one of the strongest directors working today. His past two feature films -- The Witch and The Lighthouse -- delivered compelling period pieces that feature excellent visual storytelling and tension. He continues this upward trend with The Northman, yet another period piece that will satisfy new and established fans alike, especially those who have been wanting to see Eggers try his hand at a more action-packed narrative.   The Northman, written by Eggers and Sjón, is about Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a prince turned berserker, seeking revenge against the man who murdered his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). Along the way, he allies with Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a woman with her own stake in this quest for revenge. The story may seem familiar to some, and that is likely because the legend of Amleth was the inspiration for Shakespeare's Hamlet, and this film does not try to hide this connection.   There is an inherently Shakspearean quality to this script and its characters, hearkening back to Eggers' theatrical background. That being said, The Northman feels like it is meant to be a movie, not a play, thanks to the stunning cinematography. Jarin Blaschke, a frequent collaborator with Eggers, shoots the action of this film in its full glory, and the editing allows viewers to linger on these shots and the fight choreography. Despite the dark subject matter, the setting of The Northman looks beautiful on screen, making one want to explore this more rural part of the world.   While leaning into the gritty and grim side of Viking history, The Northman also takes on a mythic quality. The obvious reason for this is its incorporation of Norse mythology and traditions, but it is also because the story of Amleth falls in line with the hero's journey stories -- like The Odyssey -- that have inspired so much of modern films. One can easily imagine Amleth's quest being shared orally centuries ago. Viewers are lucky to have it told today on the big screen, especially with how strong the visuals are in this film.   No punches are pulled with The Northman, as Skarsgård delivers on his berserker portrayal. The pain Amleth feels and the lengths he is willing to go to are clear. While he is far from a pure hero, viewers can still empathize with him, even when he is at his darkest points. This also goes for the rest of the cast, as no one is purely good. These are complicated characters, and most of them have done morally questionable or straight-up vile things; however, they feel human, and audiences will be intrigued by them, regardless of their past, their motives, or their actions.   Nicole Kidman and Taylor-Joy, in particular, should be praised for this. As the two predominant women in the film, they could have easily fallen into the traditional gender roles of mother and love interest, respectively. However, these actors, the directing, and the script elevate these characters beyond that. They are complex women with their own desires -- desires that one wishes they could see more of. Kidman's character is one of the most interesting, and it's a shame more of her character could not be explored, as most of her nuances are told to the audience instead of shown.   At the heart of this film is the revenge story, and The Northman delivers. The action and fighting in this film are captivating, and one believes that Amleth will do whatever it takes to avenge his father. While gruesome, the violence fits the world and is handled in a way that is as entertaining as it is shocking. However, there are a few moments where The Northman lets audiences fill in the horrors that are happening, avoiding the pitfalls of depicting traumatic events for shock factor. More action films should take note of how it's done here, as the action, violence, and fighting in The Northman is on full display, feels heavy, and is well-paced. While over two hours long, The Northman does not drag, and that's in part due to how it blends in its action with the rest of the narrative.   The Northman is what it promised to be -- brutal and Shakespearean. Eggers continues to impress as a director, and while this is his first foray into the action genre, his style is written all over this film. The Northman leaves viewers excited to see what Eggers will tackle next.  Caitlin Sinclair Chappell is a writer turned editor at CBR.

"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is the kind of revenge-driven tale that, if made by anyone other than visionary director Robert Eggers, would have felt like an uber-masculine journey that ended in audiences leaving wondering why they spent over two hours watching men fighting rather than going to therapy. Instead, The Northman is the kind of movie that breaks down that revenge-driven narrative and weaves it into a story of a lost boy trying to find answers only to be confronted with a different reality than he wanted to believe. Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, the son of King Aurvandil War-Raven (played by Ethan Hawke) and Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), who witnessed his uncle, Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang), kill his father. Amleth then makes it his goal in life (once he escapes from Fjölnir’s death sentence) to avenge his father’s death and save his mother. What wasn’t as cut and dry about Eggers’ The Northman from the trailers was the heart and love story at the center that drives Amleth’s actions as he seeks answers to his past and a path to move forward with what the legends have said about his own story. Heading into this movie, I hadn’t looked up Amleth’s story, only to leave the theater thinking to myself how much the story reminded me of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. That makes sense given that Shakespeare apparently used the Medieval Scandinavian legend of Amleth as a direct inspiration for his Hamlet.  The story is quite simple: A boy is taken away from his rightful place as prince (an eventual king) and desires to get revenge against the uncle who took that throne from him. With Amleth’s story, it is more of a betrayal of both his uncle and his mother (which does happen in Hamlet when Queen Gertrude marries Claudius after the murder of Hamlet’s father).  Sure, this film is bloody but I knew that going in and I was excited for the gore that awaited me. (The man beside me did exclaim “oh COME ON” at one point and that I did love.) But Amleth’s true story is that of love. He finds Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and while their initial attraction to each other is driven by their revenge (in albeit different ways), the two are brought together and fall in love through their desire to seek revenge against Fjölnir. While the story of his mother’s betrayal shouldn’t have been a shock, it still hurt to see Amleth watch the woman he sought after to save was the one who wished him dead. And though he dedicates his life to fighting against Fjölnir and what he did to his father, in the end, it is about Amleth and his struggle to accept his own history and life. The legend is one that we’ve obviously seen told time and time again through adaptations, whether we knew it or not, but Eggers brings the story to life in a gruesome yet breathtaking way and Skarsgård weaves Amleth’s pain into the character at every turn.  It is bloody and there is a part of this movie where Alexander Skarsgård kills a man by bashing his head in with his own head but it was the kind of movie that I expected that level of gruesome fighting in and it worked for the story as a whole. This is a movie that, if you feel comfortable going to a theater, you won’t want to miss in a cinematic sense because it’s beautiful and ties in wonderfully to Eggers’ unique style. "
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Reaching back through time to that unfixed point at which recorded history blurs into legend and allegory, the filmmaker’s cinematic folktales combine meticulous research with a sincere belief in the occult. Eggers’ worlds are alive with palpably authentic details, but they’re equally awash in images that cannot be explained in a way that makes the uncanny feel plausible and present. It was never in doubt, for example, that dark forces lurked in the early American wilderness of The Witch, Eggers’ feature debut. Within that film’s first ten minutes, a baby was abducted by the titular, exceedingly real crone, who ground him up into a sticky paste to smear across her naked body. The Lighthouse, his twice-as-feverish follow-up, depicted two lighthouse keepers losing their minds while isolated during a fierce storm. Egger’s latest marks a significant step toward the mainstream for a director known for his forcefully opaque arthouse visions. And yet, despite its bigger budget, all-star cast, and comparatively easier-to-parse narrative, The Northman is propelled by the same mixture of myth, madness, and overriding weirdness that’s become Eggers’ signature. The Northman feels like a natural progression for Eggers, though it also constitutes his largest-scale undertaking to date: a brooding, blood-soaked Viking epic that cost $90 million to make. (The Lighthouse clocked in at $11 million, and The Witch was made for less than half of that.) Given the dramatically increased budget, it makes sense that Eggers’ latest is his most accessible work — not lit like The Witch, near-entirely by candle flame, nor stylized in The Lighthouse’s black-and-white, Academy-ratio format.  It’s also much easier on the ears. Whereas The Witch drew its Early Modern English dialogue right out of the Geneva Bible, and The Lighthouse studied the bawdy, salt-encrusted dialects of sea dogs from its era, The Northman mainly reserves its Old Norse and Old Slavic for sequences of ritual and prophecy. Eggers penned the script with Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, who also co-wrote last year’s Lamb. Their collaboration echoes the lyrical, mist-laden quality of family sagas from the region without cooling the fervent heat of the emotions fueling its protagonist. Departing from the campfire tales and sea shanties of the director’s native New England, The Northman is based on the same Scandinavian folk story said to have inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet — though its revenge-odyssey narrative operates along such a primal wavelength one could just as easily imagine Eggers discovering it inscribed on a cave wall.  The film opens with a homecoming, as the gloriously named King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returns to his queen, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), after an expedition abroad. Aurvandil’s young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak), is eager to one day inherit his kingdom, though an initiation ritual performed by the courtesan Heimir (Willem Dafoe) promises only that Amleth’s fate is sealed, without going into the particulars. (This sequence marks The Northman’s first detour into hallucinogenic, heavy-metal territory, complete with a crown dipped in blood and a Viking holding open his own chest to reveal a sacred tree with branches in Valhalla.) Shortly thereafter, Amleth’s uncle, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), ambushes and murders Aurvandil in a bid for the throne, taking Gudrún as his queen and ordering Amleth slain. The boy survives, fleeing his homeland even as he vows to return and reclaim all that has been stolen from him.  Years later, the film picks up with an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard), who lives among a group of Viking berserkers and is soon seen raiding a Slav village, scaling the walls and steadily advancing through its blood-slicked, mud-caked grounds. Eggers reteamed with The Witch and Lighthouse cinematographer Jarin Blaschke on The Northman, and their immersive, labor-intensive approach to shooting action — including this early sequence, captured with a single camera in one unbroken take — is a striking evolution of the naturalistic techniques they’ve employed previously.  As Amleth lays waste to countless Slavs charging in from all sides, the camera shares his bloodlust yet remains perfectly positioned to document the intensity of the surrounding battle. Such relentlessly striking, passionate camerawork is in steady supply throughout The Northman — one of a few technical fronts on which the film surpasses many bigger-budget blockbusters the American studio system has produced in recent years.  Once the village has been captured, and following a vision of a whispering seeress (Björk) in a feathered headdress, Amleth encounters Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic woman newly bound for slavery in Iceland. “Your strength may break men’s bones, but I have the cunning to break their minds,” she tells him, and the two eventually grow close. Amleth learns that Fjolnir is no longer king in the North Atlantic and now commands only a modest outpost on the side of an Icelandic mountain. It’s time, he decides, to take his revenge. As Amleth sets this plot into motion, The Northman trades the majestic bearing and brutality of its first third for a slower-burning center. Though his classical style still owes a sizable debt to Scandinavian film legends like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, The Northman feels most like Eggers’ faithful tribute to Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, the Wrath of God, imbuing landscapes with a sinister presence that justifies the spiraling mental states of those foolhardy enough to try to tame them.  Eggers is clearly fascinated by the duality of physical and spiritual realms in Norse culture, and he depicts both in vivid detail. Glimpses of Valhalla appear to Amleth throughout, and his quest to procure a mythical blade causes him to at one point venture below ground, where the boundaries between life and afterlife are even blurrier. The director finds an imposing natural fit for this focus amid the volcanic landscapes of Iceland, all raging fire beneath frozen mountains, a landscape that feels as primordial as all the magic and myth that exists within it.  Eggers is fortunate to have attracted Skarsgard to the leading role. Physically uncompromising and possessed of a singular, seething determination, the Swedish actor radiates Amleth’s rage but retains a deft-enough edge as a performer to shade his expressions with a more plaintive anguish and self-doubt. Like co-star Taylor-Joy, whose otherworldly appeal magnifies the film’s own, Skarsgard is one of those fearless actors who’s most at home navigating dark material. It’s a rare leading man who can convey the strange, sympathetic naivete of a character first seen sinking an ax into a horse, biting a man’s ear off, and howling at the moon like a wild animal, but such is Skarsgard’s power."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman, is a grim masterwork of guttural vengeance."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ grim, gory and gorgeous tale lets us sentimentalize “the hero’s journey,” and then disembowels that sentiment to make us question revenge as a dramatic driving force.  The boy has just enough time to absorb the responsibilities and expectations laid on him before his father is murdered and he is chased into exile, rowing away with sea chanty vows of “I will avenge you, Father, I will save you Mother, I will kill you Fjölnir,” the “brotherless” usurper who took his mother and became king.  The boy’s name is Amleth, and as there’s a murdered father, a remarried mother (Nicole Kidman) and a jester (Willem Dafoe) in this palace court, the similarities to Shakespeare’s Hamlet are certainly intentional. But the adult Amleth is no “melancholy Dane,” dithering about “To be, or not to be.” Fleeing to the East, growing up among a clan that makes upriver slaving raids among the Rus (Russians) its chief business, Amleth never takes his eyes off the prize. He passes himself off as a slave and joins the feisty, mystical Slav Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) on the long boat bound to Iceland, where Fjölnir and his mother have fled, running a big farm because the kingdom he stole has been stolen from him. Amleth will get close, “torment” his tormentor and fulfill his “revenge at the Gates of Hel” destiny. A century of Viking films and a couple of solid but soapy TV series are cast aside in “Northman’s” attention to anthropological detail. Eggers and his co-writer (Sjón, of “Lamb”) give us a wholly-conceived world of sturdy woodwork, leather, steel, mud and blood. There are historically-sound realizations of Viking religion and Viking rituals — throat singing as it is still practiced in Tibet, a  score of drums, pipes and animal horns, displays of menacing, bellowing pre-battle brawn made famous the Maori of New Zealand , frenzied dances and “berserking,” pitiless murder and pillaging. There are mystical succession ceremonies and visions of a Valkyrie escort to Valhalla. Skarsgård, in fearsome-enough-to-be-shirtless shape, gives Amleth just enough brooding contemplation to make the character’s story arc credible. He is as limited in his choice of actions as that Prince of Denmark. He must do what he must do, even when he starts to question it. Tayloy-Joy, the “It Girl” who first gained fame in Eggers’ breakout film “The Witch,” makes Olga of the Birch Forest fearsome and positively possessed when the occasion calls for it, beguiling when that’s her play.  The Icelandic singer Björk pops up as a seeress, and a few familiar non-Nordic faces pepper the cast, which explains the odd but effective Scots-Nordic accent that passes for lingua franca in this Viking world.  Eggers blends in plenty of lighter moments in this swords and savagery tale, with Dafoe sparkling as the king’s fool and gags about the new king’s oldest son, the slightly-built Thórir the Proud (Gustav Lindh), playing “Quien es mas macho?” with the hulking, 12-packed new slave.  Yet “Northman” never stops feeling like a saga, a tale passed down orally, a Viking “Odyssey.” It’s never less than epic, never less than the new benchmark in Viking stories put on film. And  Skarsgård, given a rare lead, and the filmmakers make us invest in this “hero’s journey” even if we think we’ve guessed how it ends. Because with those bloody-minded Vikings, you just never know. "
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," If you're familiar with your Danish history or Shakespearean etymology, chances are you'll already be roughly familiar with 'The Northman'. The story that gave the world 'Hamlet' - arguably the most adapted of all of the Bard's works - was really a sinewy revenge story involving berserker vikings, blood feuds, betrayal, and lots of rain and mud. That we think of 'Hamlet' now and are drawn to the likes of Kenneth Branagh's resplendent adaptation in our minds is something that Robert Eggers sets out to rectify inside of the opening five or ten minutes. This version of 'Hamlet' is cut back to the bone, preserving only the most vital elements and as a result, making it all the more stronger. Much like Akira Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood' or Elder Millenial cultural touchstone '10 Things I Hate About You', a change of scenery often does wonders for Shakespeare and allows it to flourish. 'The Northman' turns 'Hamlet' into a pulsing thriller where the camera moves constantly, the dialogue is sharpened to a knife's edge, and the performances are as visceral and committed as you can get. Alexander Skarsgard channels the intensity he displayed in the likes of 'Generation Kill', all thousand-yard stares and violent upheaval, while Claes Bang matches him with equal ferocity in later scenes. Nicole Kidman and Anya Taylor-Joy both spin what could have been easily relegated to supporting roles into something truly special, with Kidman, in particular, doing some of her best work in years in the final act. Speaking of supporting roles, it's a credit to Robert Eggers' eye for casting that familiar faces like our own Olwen Fouéré and Ralph Ineson crop up and look completely at ease in the harsh landscape he's created. By far, 'The Northman' is Robert Eggers' most mainstream movie yet. After the mind-bending two-hander of 'The Lighthouse', you can see how his skills have progressed to such a point where he can take on a saga like this and bend it to his own vision and skill, yet still make it accessible for multiplex audiences to grasp. In fact, it might even inspire them to seek out both 'The Lighthouse' and 'The VVitch'. Yet, in comparison to those two movies, 'The Northman' feels lesser in certain respects. 'The Lighthouse' wasn't afraid to go to some truly batshit places, same as 'The VVitch', and let the audience figure it all out. Here, 'The Northman' is much more linear and - dare we say it - formulaic. After all, it's a revenge story and revenge stories can only go towards one place - and the ending for 'The Northman' leaves nothing to the imagination, both thematically and physically. Yet, like a snarling, raging thrash metal headbanger of a song, it's all so brutally effective that you're not overly concerned with any of this when you're in it because it's such an assault on the senses. The sound design, the cinematography, the weighty dialogue - there's even flashes of the toilet humour in 'The Lighthouse'. You can't help but get a sense that director Robert Eggers has hit his stride here and is on his way to something much bigger than a comic-book movie. If ever there was a director to take on 'Nosferatu' for a new generation, it's him. 'The Northman' succeeds as one of the most striking adaptations of 'Hamlet' put on screen, with a cast more than equal to the task and a director in full command of his talents. The rest is silence."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," After the wonderful weirdness of The VVitch and The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers now turns to much more traditional filmmaking with a piece that’s compelling, but overly familiar. Robert Eggers is quickly establishing himself as the new auteur-to-be of New Hollywood. He’s a part of a new generation of directors who are seemingly driven by excessive violence, trauma and art. Ari Aster, Jordan Peele and Julia Ducournau have all used genre films to explore much more difficult topics and the results have been as frightening as they are unusual.  Eggers now sails onto more familiar waters with The Northman, his most accessible film to date, but still a tough watch by all means. Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, whose father has been slain by his own brother when Amleth was only a boy, a horrific act which he witnessed before escaping. Amleth now vows to avenge his father’s death and to save his mother, who was taken by Amleth’s uncle.  What follows is a surprisingly familiar story of revenge. Eggers’ style is pleasingly theatrical and the scale and scope of the story is epic, as is the storytelling, but The Northman feels like an anomaly in Eggers’ body of work. Despite trippy imagery and almost dream-like visuals, The Northman is ultimately a story we’ve seen before, countless times. If The VVitch was enticing and The Lighthouse was weird, The Northman is undeniably epic. It’s a ferocious film, one that attacks your senses from all directions, but Eggers is also in total control of all the elements. The sound design is immersive, the score seducing and visually, The Northman is as handsome as they come but I needed it to go further and be weirder.  Everything in The Northman is impressive, but its relentless violence and lack of warmth might also prove alienating for some. Eggers seems awfully interested in the human body in all its ugliness; burping and farting are signs of manhood and the human body is constantly violated and abused. It’s almost like, for Eggers, humanity equals suffering. It makes for an uncomfortable and challenging watch, but a rewarding one too.  Skarsgård gives the sort of performance that makes a man’s career in Hollywood. He joins Ryan Gosling in Drive and Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain playing silent, strong, violent men who feel everything, but speak nothing of their pain. Skarsgård’s performance is feral and animalistic, primal and the kind that will be remembered.  Equally impressive are Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicole Kidman. For Eggers, it seems that women and womanhood is something mystical, almost mythical but also sacred. Both women give the illusion of an inner life for their characters that doesn’t necessarily seem to be present in the script, but this is exactly why you hire such talented people, to help hide your weaknesses.  The Northman is epic, hypnotising and compelling. It’s a hair short of a masterpiece, it’s just a little too traditional and overstays its welcome by a smidge. While everything in The Northman feels vital and important, individual scenes tip into self-indulgence as Eggers’ camera lingers on Skarsgård’s muddied, blood-stained face a tad too long. Nevertheless, this is major work from one of the most interesting cinematic voices currently working. ★★★★☆ The Sitting Duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist Maureen Kearney, brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert, amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship.
 ★★★★☆ The Sitting Duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist Maureen Kearney, brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert, amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"  The Northman (in theaters April 22) is in fact a tough time for Vikings, though it's arguable whether they ever had any other kind. It is also, beneath the arthouse sheen of A24 and the raft of prestige weirdos — Anya Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe, Björk — on board, a fairly straightforward genre movie: A blood-soaked revenge saga somewhere between Clint Eastwood, Conan the Barbarian, and The Clan of the Cave Bear, with a heady glaze of metaphysical fantasy.
  That it was made by writer-director Robert Eggers, who also helmed the 2015 Sundance fever dream The Witch and 2019's surreal sea-shanty chamber piece The Lighthouse, is less expected, though his imprint is all over the film — in its grand monologues and strange mythologies, the baroque, uncanny sense of world-building. What's less clear this time is whether any of it means anything, or is even really supposed to.
  Alexander Skarsgård at least seems born to play Amleth, the deposed ninth-century warrior-prince whose betrayal as a child at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) leaves him shorn of both his parents (Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke) and his North Atlantic kingdom. Conscripted into a roving band of mercenaries who storm villages, leaving scorch marks and pillage in their wake, his purpose hardens, ""a freezing river of hate."" And news that his usurper still lives — now an exile himself, somewhere in Iceland — offers the cosmic chance at retribution he's spent years preparing for. To reach Fjölnir, he'll need to draft himself onto a slave ship with other chattel of war, though he isn't the only one there with no plans to surrender; Taylor-Joy's ferocious, flaxen-haired concubine Olga has, she tells him serenely, her own powers of persuasion beyond the sword.
"
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE," No filmmaker in the last 20 years has done folklore quite like Robert Eggers. The Witch and The Lighthouse showcased his skilful ability to transpose the stories of old into celluloid form, without losing the historical, mystical and cultural veracity of their origin, and both have been weird and wacky gifts to behold. Yet these intimate portraits of North American myth are a whole different ballgame compared to the Viking legend of Eggers’ latest cinematic endeavour. To say he’s stepped it up a notch would be an understatement — the man’s smashed it right out of the park. In an ambitious exploration of Nordic mythology, various gods are worshipped — anyone familiar with Marvel’s take on the Thor franchise will recognise names such as Odin or Freyja — but this is very much the brutal story of man. One man, in particular: Prince Amleth, a beast of a warrior played with feral intensity by Alexander Skarsgård. He stalks across the screen, shoulders hunched forward and carrying the weight of every kill he’s committed since fleeing his home as a cub after witnessing the murder of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), in a power move to take over their kingdom in the North. If this tale feels similar to Hamlet, that’s because Eggers and his co-writer, Icelandic poet Sjón, took inspiration from the same 12th-century Danish story as Shakespeare. But the two have expertly interwoven mystical strands of Icelandic fable into five, multilayered chapters of bombastic drama, steeped in so much familial conflict, barbaric romance and bloodthirsty violence that after two-and-a-half hours, your mind, body and soul might just need an ice bath to recover. Each vignette of action is articulated with such high-octane precision and depth by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke that no performance is wasted. In one sequence, the camera tracks Amleth roaring into action, sprinting at an encampment as spears and arrows whip past his naked body before he launches onto its high, wooden wall, hauls himself over and, with an axe, meets the heads, necks and backs of several opponents. Later, as he prowls through the village and turns out of shot, we witness the unrelentingly cruel violence visited upon defenceless women and children, before he returns to the frame in murderous fashion. Long takes like these, accompanied by composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s pulsating score, throbbing with drumbeats and low notes, emphasise the savage spectacle and unforgiving harshness of these times, but also the powerful physicality of Skarsgård. The Swedish actor has long wanted to play a Viking, and Eggers has created the perfect environment to truly bring out the berserker within. Whether it’s in the natural light against backdrops of forests, mountains, seas and rivers or behind the veil, on the rich, black-and-white plane of gods, dead kings and valkyries, Skarsgård seems possessed with Old Nordic fire, showing both melancholy and a taste for blood. It’s quite unlike anything he’s done before. In such a wild historical epic, each actor, in fact, brings a willingness to throw themselves into the madness. Anya Taylor-Joy holds her own as white witch Olga of the Birch Forest, a character who is as radiant as she is resourceful, imbued with quiet confidence and emotional rigour. Hawke and Willem Dafoe — as Heimir the Fool — are riotously primeval in an early rite-of-passage scene; Björk’s seeress is pure magic; and Bang brings dignity and believable lethality to his chief antagonist. Nicole Kidman, meanwhile, is positively chaotic as Amleth’s queen mother, with a role that puts her son’s whole worldview into question. That’s the beauty of this story of heroes and villains, good and evil: it’s all about perspective, and Eggers’ vision of the Old World is one that closes in on the fallacies of men who are willing to kill and die for the sake of legacy, honour and tradition. He takes us on a bloody, merciless voyage across land, sea and otherworlds, culminating with a cathartic third-act battle realised in blazing glory. “Til Valhall!”, indeed."
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE,Eggers continues to cement himself among the greats with a fierce Viking tale of vengeance. It's a good mix of visual thunder and blood-soaked violence. Skarsgard's tank-like stature drives the narrative beautifully. Kidman surprises....big time. 
"Apr 12, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is raw, savage and uncompromising. It's a ruthless revenge story set during the Viking Age, and Alexander Skarsgård is a beast of a man."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," When I think of The Witch and The Lighthouse director Robert Eggers, “accessible” isn’t the first word that comes to mind. He’s not the type of filmmaker that one expects to make a mainstream blockbuster flick. And yet, Eggers has surprised me with his latest, The Northman, a brutal revenge tale that straddles the line between arthouse and mainstream entertainment. It’s a Viking epic unlike anything we’ve seen since Nicolas Winding Refn’s awesome Valhalla Rising, and I’d put this one right up there with it as the best this particular subgenre has to offer. Alexander Skarsgard was born for the role of Amleth. The Nordic actor has always been a physical specimen since his time on True Blood, but never anything quite like this. He’s absolutely jacked, looking every bit the bloodthirsty Viking spirit of vengeance his character will become. But we first meet Amleth as a young boy, raised into the warmongering ways through his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), and mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). But merrymaking over newly conquered lands is brief, as the boy is forced to grow up quickly when a betrayal leads to tragedy. It’s the boy’s first harsh lesson about the world, and the responsibility that comes with being on the throne. The grown-up Amleth is an absolute beast. Years have passed and he’s ignored his boyish vow of revenge, until fate and an ill prophecy set him back on the path. But this isn’t a straight-forward slash ‘n burn affair, although Eggers and co-writer
Sjón could’ve satisfyingly gone that route. There’s actually quite a bit of stealth and tension involved, as Amleth poses as a slave so that he can strike at the right moment. It’s during this time that he also meets Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga, a resourceful witch and fearsome in her own right. This is an intensely masculine film, but the women are as deadly as any man. What strikes you while watching The Northman is how visceral the whole thing is, savage and animalistic in its fury and sexual passions. You can tell Skarsgard and Eggers have been itching to make a movie just like this. Adapting the Scandinavian folk tale of Amleth, a large influence on Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Eggers has delivered something truly special; an epic wrapped in myth and fire and blood. Technically impeccable, the haunting visuals by cinematographer Jarin Blaschke recall his work with Eggers on The Witch and The Lighthouse. But the range, the scale is so much larger, enveloping you completely in this unsparing Berserker world. The action is incredible, as well. The camera sweeps seamlessly across an unstoppable Berserker raid, where the men pillage and slaughter everything in their path, stopping only long enough to capture the women like spoils of war. Some of the killing will make your stomach turn, with Amleth performing some gruesome acts of murder on his path for payback. It’s a surprisingly rich role for Skarsgard. His Amleth is a complicated man and not just a heartless killer. We see tender moments between him and Olga, but also conflicting emotions when it comes to his mother. Speaking of which, Kidman is fantastic here in what appears to be a fairly simple role in the beginning. But once the action gets going, Kidman’s role expands into something much more complex, making Amleth’s quest more difficult than he’s prepared for. I was also surprised by an almost unrecognizable Claes Bang, who play Amleth’s treacherous uncle Fjölnir. I had never realized how tall Bang is, making him a physical force opposite Skarsgard, something that comes in very handy in the volcanic final clash. Disappointing is that we don’t get more of Willem Dafoe as the Fool, or Bjork in her first role in more than twenty years. Her scene is pivotal but as a fan I really hoped for more. The Northman is an incredible, unrelenting experience that is so perfectly an Eggers movie. All of his films have his stamp all over them, nobody is making movies like him right now and I hope he keeps being given this level of freedom. When the end of the year comes around I wouldn’t be surprised if Focus Features runs this one back to remind people just how great it really is."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," There’s a stench to Robert Eggers’ movies, almost like they are filmed in smell-o-vision. In one of the opening scenes of his new film, The Northman, a young Amleth, who will grow up to be Alexander Skarsgård, visits a court jester-slash-witch portrayed by Willem Dafoe, with his father, the King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Performing a ritual, Dafoe asks, “prove you are not a dog.” Aurvandil burps. Dafoe’s Heimir smells it. That is all the proof he needs. The child farts in the same spirit. Later, the grown version of Amleth stands in front of a burning structure, having just pillaged a town. Bodies are trapped inside. The smoke fills the screen, and for a moment it seems like it fills the theater, the holograms of flesh and ash entering your nose. Over the course of three movies, Eggers has made a name for himself with densely researched, meticulously crafted historical fables that defy their genres and period settings. In The Witch, he asked: What if the Puritan witch panic was infused with actual horror? In The Lighthouse, he turned a nautical seafaring tale into a black and white comedy of masculine egos gone awry. Now in The Northman, armed with a reported $90 million budget, he poses the question: What if a Viking epic was sick as fuck?  My flippancy is, yes, partially for my own amusement, but it also describes the feeling of seeing The Northman, a two hour and 20 minute saga flush with violence and mysticism. It’s a visceral assault of blood that lays the grime on thick, but is also deeply, densely spiritual. Eggers treats the mythologies he draws on with supreme reverence: By the end of The Northman, the audience has been so thoroughly plunged into this chilly world that the notion of Valhalla seems palpable. Eggers and his co-writer, the Icelandic poet Sjón, borrowed liberally from the Nordic legend that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and the narrative follows beats. Amleth’s father Aurvandil is slain by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who takes his sister-in-law Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, having so much fun) for his bride. Amleth escapes certain execution, and vows to “avenge father, save mother, and kill Fjölnir.” Years later, he remembers to act upon this promise after having been counseled to fulfill his mission by a Seeress, a perfectly cast Björk. (Who else?) He realizes his adoptive Viking gang has just enslaved a group of people who are to be sold to Fjölnir, now living in quasi-exile in Iceland. On the passage to this new land, he meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who immediately sees through his ruse and eventually becomes his lover and partner in crime. Plot-wise The Northman is deceptively simple, but to make that assessment you would be ignoring all the strange and eerie sense of detail and place that Eggers and Sjón bring to the screen. Amleth’s journey is rendered with such specificity that his quest is all-consuming for the viewer. When it takes disorienting detours—like when Amleth must battle a ghostly warrior to claim his Night Blade, a weapon that can only be drawn in the cover of darkness—you’re entranced but not shocked because you’ve already been embedded in the customs of this environment. The violence that Eggers puts on screen is rendered in a similar way. You never become numb to its shocking brutality, but you understand it as the way of these people. In Skarsgård, Eggers has an ideal avatar for this adventure. The towering Swedish actor, naturally, has the Viking physicality—all sinew and muscle constantly covered here in dried blood—but he’s also proven himself over the years to be a idiosyncratic performer, one just as at home playing weirdos as he is fulfilling strapping hero roles that match his looks. That mix of sensibilities is at home in Amleth, a man with anger in his veins, who was once a child prone to idolatry and wonder. He’s matched with Taylor-Joy, reuniting with Eggers for the first time since they both broke out with The Witch. Eggers is particularly attune to the otherworldly qualities she brings to any material, and leaves you constantly questioning whether Olga is of this earthly plane, or something else entirely. That question permeates The Northman in a way that is beautifully unsettling. It’s a sensory overload. Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke shift between night-shrouded sequences that are almost etched in black and white and moments where candlelight paints faces as if they were in oil. Eggers's camera hunts the way Amleth does in extended, virtuosic tracking shots. You can almost taste the sweat and the salt and and the fire, grounding the experience in the tangible, but hovering just on the edge of every frame is the sense that there might be something greater at work. Is it Odin and his gods playing with these humans and their primitive ways? Or is it the hand of the filmmaker, keeping his captives at the edge of their seat? Whatever it is, it’s exhilarating."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL," An epic Viking revenge story based on the same Scandinavian folktale that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”, The Northman promises to bring Robert Eggers’ filmmaking onto a mainstream cultural stage. The writer-director’s third feature film – behind his excellent horror The Witch and deliciously unhinged The Lighthouse – also happens to be his first big-budget studio film. And in contrary ways, it shows. On the one hand, the budget allows Eggers to paint his vision on a far broader canvas than has previously been possible. The film’s rigorously choreographed action sequences, for instance, could never have been enacted on any smaller a project. Yet on the other hand, The Northman often ends up too preoccupied by its own scale to reach the standard set by Eggers’ earlier works. It is so focused on its mythological grandeur that it forgets the most basic principles of storytelling: to let the human element light the narrative’s way. Sharing writing duties with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón – who also helped pen the Noomi Rapace-starring Lamb – the auteur’s latest tells the tale of the exiled Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), the son of a king (Ethan Hawke) who was once shot down and beheaded by his own brother (a phenomenal Claes Bang). After two decades away from his home, Amleth lives as a Viking, content to raid villages and live off the spoils. That is until he meets the seeress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who reminds him of the vow he made long ago: to avenge his father, rescue his mother (Nicole Kidman), and to take back his land. Skarsgård deserves every praise for his savage, animalistic portrayal of the tortured prince hellbent on vengeance. Yet the story is too rigid to allow for emotional depth beyond the character’s rage, which means the quieter scenes leave Skarsgård’s performance feeling wooden. Likewise, Taylor-Joy is underserved by a script that doesn’t afford Olga much texture beyond her role as a mysterious love interest for the hulking protagonist. However, and despite clear difficulties with the accent, it’s Kidman who’s handed a role far meatier than the trailer suggested and which she sinks her teeth into with great relish. Meanwhile, Eggers’ typically stunning cinematography, formal mastery, and reverence for historical detail is fully realised thanks to his re-teaming with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke and editor Louise Ford. But even with its pitiless, primeval landscapes, feverish action, and beautiful renditions of Norse beliefs, there’s something inexplicably flat about The Northman. While both The Witch and The Lighthouse revelled in the liminal space between the otherworldly and the everyday, The Northman’s place at the intersection of mythology and brutally tactile Viking history is like a battlefield for two conflicting identities, rather than the foundations for richer, harmonious whole; the sometimes-awkward editing and often-static narrative is clear evidence of that. For all its grandiose beauty, The Northman substitutes heart for mechanical pacing. Instead of being compelled forward by Amleth’s inner life, the film is pulled along to the beat of his obsessive refrain: “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” It functions just fine in moving things along, but there’s no soul to be found there and very little to emotionally connect to. The Northman can’t help but feel like a wild stallion being reluctantly reined in. Even with all its screaming and grunting, the film is subdued; a retold revenge story with strong pillars but no inner life, that suggests a spinning moral compass yet backs down from anything too provocative (and impressively, succeeds in making an incestuous flirtation disappointingly tame). In the end, The Northman offers spectacle over story and heart, despite the distinct sense that it’s trying – and failing – to do both."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Eggers' deep dive into VikingNorse culture and religion is fascinating. However, an unsatisfying and routine tale of murder and revenge that surprises no one is only saved by the Hannibal-esque moments of violence."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," Ready for the arthouse version of a Viking epic? Since his feature film debut, writer/director Robert Eggers has been gathering critical acclaim for his esoteric spin on genre. With 2015's The Witch, he brought dread-filled atmosphere and accents as thick as molasses to folk horror. With The Lighthouse, black-and-white cinematography collided with madcap machismo for a tale of men and mermaids unlike had been seen before. Now, with The Northman, Eggers explores the myths of Vikings in a historical epic that is star-stuffed, action-packed, and yet far from the crowd-pleasing likes of Gladiator. Co-written by Eggers and Icelandic novelist Sjón, The Northman unfurls the legend of Amleth, a 10th-century Norseman on a gruesome quest of vengeance. If you know the story of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, you know the broad strokes here, as Hamlet was based on Amleth's tale. As a boy, the princeling Amleth admires his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke), above all else. When the king is murdered by his traitorous brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), Amleth swears vengeance against his uncle. After escaping by the skin of his teeth, he grows up in a pack of vicious raiders, learning the ways of battle before coming across a witch (Björk), who delivers a prophecy that drives the now grown and brawny Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) back to his homeland. His plan is to avenge his father and rescue his captive mother (Nicole Kidman) by murdering his uncle. However, the fates have specific instructions on how this must happen. And falling for a young and gorgeous clairvoyant Olga (The Witch's Anya Taylor-Joy) complicates matters for Amleth, as he now has something to lose beyond his life.  If the endless waves of bloodless superhero movies have you hankering for something harder hitting, then you may well relish the graphic violence of The Northman. With an R-rating, the film is not only able to show the gore so studiously excluded from PG-13 action movies, but also is able to audaciously depict the brutality of Viking culture. There are decapitations aplenty, dismembered bodies crafted into ruin symbols, and a farmhouse filled with children burned to the ground (presumably to prevent any other Amleth story arcs). Notably, many of these acts are committed by our hero or through his complicity. No matter how ghoulish, Amleth's response to this carnage is either stoic stares or yowling war cries of intimidation. Violence, Eggers seems to say with a shrug, is just such a common element of Viking life that the hero is inured to it.  Further pulling us into Amleth's perspective is Eggers's tendency to build visual worlds so carefully detailed that you can almost smell them. And that smell is knowingly repugnant. Amleth's is a world not only of blood and sweat, but also mud, rotting flesh, and shit. Fart jokes and burbling burps are central to father-son bonding. A mummified skull recalls ""Alas, poor Yorick"" with a twisted grin. As a visual cue that all in this world is tainted by the violence of man, everything is covered in relentless grime. Well, save for its radiant women.  While Amleth and his male cohorts are often covered in muck, his mother and lover have porcelain skin as flawless and sparkling as their long, untangled, blonde hair. In every frame, these two look ready to glide into a photoshoot for a magazine cover. While The Northman is steeped in realistic details, the fashioning of these female characters plays into the fantasy of myths and the supernatural seen elsewhere. These are not women as they would be, but as Amleth has idealized them. As such, the cinematography from Jarin Blaschke regards them with the rapt fascination that he does the Icelandic landscapes that surround embattled heroes and villains.  Like the American Western, The Northman cuts wide to these the glories and apathy of the wild around them. In this case, that means not only crashing beaches, rolling green hills, and towering forests, but also a raging volcano, where the final battle is fated to be held. These beauties contrast with the brutality to create a chaotic visual splendor in The Northman. So, why did this movie leave me so numb?  Aesthetically, I appreciate the world Eggers has built, so fetid with detail that you do feel thrust into this space of wrath, rot, and violence. Intellectually, I comprehend what Amleth is going through, dedicating his entire existence and identity to avenging a father who has become a faded memory. However, I didn't feel it.  Admittedly, I've never been much for Eggers' preferred performance style. His films boast a clunky theatricality as if his stars are on an ill-lit stage, performing Shakespeare to the back row. Amid so many grounded production design choices, such acting feels false or forced. The anguish of Amleth is not something I could connect with, perhaps because Skarsgård's performance is a medley of scowl and howls. His hulking shoulders and flexing muscles show a warrior, but give us no access to his soul. The women are more often given dialogue about emotions, which Kidman and Taylor-Joy deliver with poise and an edge of grandiosity that makes their characters feel mythic but not real. Some roles work with such extravagance, like Björk's prophesizing or The Lighthouse's Willem Dafoe, playing another a wise fool. However, their screentime is cruelly cut short, so we might focus on a hero who is hard to root for. After all, as we're getting to know Amleth, he watches the slaughter of innocent children with apparent apathy. If he feels nothing, why should I feel for him? Perhaps Eggers overplays his hand with the violence. As Amleth's campaign of vengeance grows more audacious, audience members were chuckling at the grim reveals of his slaughtered victims. There is a comical collision in the sternness of these men and the outrageous of the violence that turns limbs into a macabre sculpture. But it's not exactly funny as much as jarring. The Northman is filled with conflict, between the real and the fantastical, the stoic and the absurd, the brutal and the beautiful. And while I admire the structure of such storytelling, Eggers's execution feels hollow, capturing the horror but undercutting the heart. So in the end, the blows — while intense and gory — don't hit as hard as I'd have hoped.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Something is rotten in the state of Iceland. A traumatised princeling with a mop of blonde hair grows into a mad-eyed Viking Berserker; the feared bear-warriors who ransacked their way across the ancient North. His treacherous uncle plays the role of steely-eyed sheep farmer and sometime priest, an ocean away from the kingdom for which he murdered his own brother. A young witch, stolen away from her ancestral lands in the birch forest, plots a quieter vengeance on her captors – her kin are wild mystics of the woods, who see the future with a preternatural clarity. Sinewy branches from the tree of fate connect these individuals, against the desolate plains of old Scandinavia, where men and monsters look the same under the pale glow of the moon. After the folkloric thrills of The Witch and Beckettian grotesque of The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers’ third feature film may have benefitted from a bump in budget and scale (here he partners with Universal, rather than A24) but any concerns about whether or not this shift from indie to blockbuster might have stifled his creativity are quickly dismissed. Within 10 minutes of The Northman beginning, Willem Dafoe’s Heimir the Fool is leaping around a ceremonial fire and Ethan Hawke (the ill-fated King Aurvandil War-Raven) is barking like a mad dog. A feeling of relief sets in – this is the idiosyncratic Eggers we know and love. The longboat slowly drifts out onto volatile waters. At its heart, The Northman is a tale as old as time. It has its origins in Scandinavian folklore: the story of Amleth can be traced back to the 13th century textbook, the Prose Edda, from which much contemporary understanding of Old Norse culture and mythology stems. The details vary, but the crux is the same. After his father is usurped by his uncle, Amleth swears revenge, and everything goes south from there onwards (if this all sounds a little familiar, it’s because William Shakespeare brought the story to the English-speaking world in Hamlet some 300 years later). But with every folktale the same rings true – the story’s in the telling. Teaming up with Icelandic author and poet Sjón for The Northman’s lyrical, frequently disorientating script, Eggers conjures a world where the lines between reality and the supernatural do not exist. The Old Gods and their whims are revered and feared in equal measure, while beasts of the forest possess a curiously human understanding of the world. This magical realm is inhabited by humans who know they are but playthings for capricious forces beyond their understanding. The tension comes in deciding what to do with this information. For reluctant hero Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) vengeance comes at a price he never questioned until fate intervened, bringing him to Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) who proves an invaluable ally as he draws closer to avenging his father, saving his mother (Nicole Kidman), and killing his uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang). Living as we do in an unfortunate age of blockbuster homogeneity, it feels novel to watch a film that feels like a coherent, considered vision. The Northman is a testament to the art of filmmaking, from the rough-hewn huts where our hero spends his time plotting to the visceral squelch of mud and blood. It’s a film with fingerprints all over it; one that has been crafted rather than manufactured, and rewatches reveal a chance to revel in its sharpness; a scene in which Amleth seeks the counsel of a blind Seeress (the incomparable Björk) teems with intricate set and costume details, while a violent game of Knattleikr – a Viking cross between lacrosse and rugby – proves more adrenaline-inducing than any CGI special of recent years. There’s all the violence one might expect from a Viking blockbuster, but this is tempered by moments of softness, revealing a reference for this much-mythologised culture which extends beyond the ideas looted for pop culture use in the past. The deftness of Eggers’ direction and creative team is matched by the gusto of his performers. Skarsgård – an excellent actor who has largely flown under the radar outside of his nefarious role as Nicole Kidman’s abusive husband on HBO series Big Little Lies – developed the project alongside Eggers, and this might well be the role he was born to play. The taciturn Amleth communicates mostly through brute force, and while Skarsgård certainly has the imposing Viking physicality down, there’s also something deeply vulnerable about his performance, a suggestion that Amleth’s all-consuming desire for vengeance has kept him in a state of arrested development, no more worldly than he was as a boy awed by the return of his battle-scarred father. It’s a delicate balance to strike, but Skarsgård makes it look effortless; the softness that slithers in when he shares scenes with Taylor-Joy and Kidman makes him all the more compelling. Facing off against him is Claes Bang as the similarly stoic Fjölnir, whose initial villainy gives way to something more pitiful as the story unfolds, while Kidman delivers a delightfully devious turn as Queen Gudrún. It has felt as if Kidman has been phoning it in a little lately (see Being the Ricardos, The Prom, Bombshell) but The Northman allows Unhinged Kidman to slip through, a little reminiscent of her underrated performance in To Die For. This proves a suitable foil for Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays the ethereal witch of the woods that offers Amleth a possible shot at salvation. She is fast becoming one of our more beguiling screen presences, and more than holds her own in this starry cast while providing one of the most memorable moments involving period blood in a dark confrontation with Fjölnir. In the truest sense of the word, this is a spectacle: cinema as theatre, on a scale comparable to the likes of Gladiator or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. For all its action and searing setpieces, there’s a solid emotional core – while The Northman really focuses on the age-old question of what we are willing to sacrifice for love or revenge, it’s also a pontification on self-mythologising and the limits of destiny, with plenty of twists and tricks up its sleeve. Sjón feels like an inspired choice of collaborator for Eggers, adding a mystical lyricism to the script, though of course it maintains Eggers’ impish sense of humour. Perhaps that is what feels most impressive of all; how truly this is a Robert Eggers film, delightfully strange and off-kilter as his previous work. It feels easy to bemoan the current state of cinema, with the dominance of titles based on pre-existing IP (which, if you want to get technical, The Northman is, but only just) and a slow slide towards tentpole films that lack any personality in their style or script, instead serving as a means to hopefully establish the next link in a never-ending Content chain. But when watching a film like The Northman – gloriously loud and vast in conception and execution – a glimmer of hope for the future exists. We can still have films that are bold and beautiful and transportive; there are unquestionably filmmakers working today with the vision and drive to pull it off. The question is – with Eggers himself speaking on the difficulties of making a film with such intense editorial oversight, and the gradual merging of studios to the point it feels like a monopoly is inevitable – how long must we wait for the next one?

Given the step up in scale – and, crucially, budget – that Viking epic The Northman represents for director Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse), you’d be forgiven for thinking that his uniquely twisted sensibilities might have been watered down for his first studio picture. Thankfully, there’s a howling, hallucinatory initiation ceremony in a dank shack within the first 10 minutes that quells any fear that this is Diet Eggers. It’s one of many moments throughout to make you marvel at the idiosyncratic oddness Eggers has managed to smuggle in. Adapted from the Icelandic tale of Prince Amleth - which also inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet - The Northman blends that story with Norse myths to create a 10th-century original. The aforementioned ritual is a bonding experience between the recently returned King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) and his young son, Amleth (Oscar Novak). Before you can say spoiler warning, the king’s half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, BBC’s Dracula) has ambushed and killed Aurvandil, claimed Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) for himself, and assumed the throne of the island kingdom of Hrafnsey. Witnessing this revolt, Amleth flees by boat, chanting his newly minted mantra: “I will avenge you father; I will save you mother; I will kill you Fjölnir.” When we pick up with him some years later, he’s grown into the hulking form of Alexander Skarsgård, and has been carving out an existence as a berserker in the Land of the Rus, raiding villages like it’s sport. Skarsgård delivers what might be the performance of his career so far; in beast mode in every sense, his commanding, animalistic presence and unwavering commitment to vengeance drive the story forward. An act-one raid is a set-piece standout, as Amleth and crew lay siege to a wooden village. A sequence of mud, blood and extended takes, it’s an exhilarating piece of action. The brutality on display - and the mercilessness shown towards the village’s weaker inhabitants - is yet another way in which it doesn’t feel like Eggers is making concessions for a more mainstream entertainment. Following this raid, Amleth redirects his energies to his revenge quest, heading to Iceland and the farm Fjölnir has settled in. Posing as a slave, Amleth’s all-consuming mission becomes one of infiltration, as he methodically works towards righting the wrongs against his father. Adding to the feeling of this being an Eggers picture is the return of some of his repertory players, most significantly The Witch’s Anya Taylor-Joy as an enslaved woman, Olga of the Birch Forest. Taylor-Joy’s combination of ethereal grace and resourceful hardiness are well utilized, and once again, she proves a natural fit for any timeline. Other Eggers players include Willem Dafoe as the court jester, and cameos from Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson. You can’t help wanting more of some of them, particularly Björk’s mesmerizing but brief turn as a witch, but such is the forward momentum of the film. The step-up in scale necessitates name actors, and here Hawke and Kidman provide the A-list gravitas as Amleth’s parents. Despite minimal screentime, Hawke makes a lasting impression and Kidman - in what initially threatens to be a thankless role - gets a surprising amount to do as things escalate. Both have wayward accents but, if anything, this adds to the otherworldly tone already cranked up to 11 by a thunderous soundtrack and primordial visuals. And throughout, Viking mythos is baked into the film’s DNA: prophecies, arterial family trees, and a magically infused sword are as real as the lush landscapes; Valhöll feels within reach like a neighboring country. For an outwardly straightforward revenge tale, The Northman doesn’t shy away from ambiguity, as it considers the cost of Amleth’s grudge, and the nature of this hero's journey. If that makes it sound like difficult viewing, fear not; perhaps the most impressive aspect of all is how relentlessly entertaining it is. Despite clocking in at 137 mins,  there’s no slack here, and not a wasted scene. It’s exactly what you want from a big-scale Robert Eggers Viking film. And it’s a cinematic rarity to be savored.

"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL," “The Northman” leaps over that line, jumps into a Viking ship, sets it afire and sails away, chopping off a few heads along the way for good measure. Robert Eggers’ latest film is massive in scope and ambition, so airtight in its intensity that at some point, without the pressure valve of levity, you have to chuckle. Eggers, the director of “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse,” never lets up on the go-big-or-go-home ethos. The film is gritty, grimy and earthy. You can practically smell the dirt and blood. They should have showers in the lobby afterward. A stickler for accuracy, he and co-writer Sjon, an Icelandic poet and novelist, fill the film with characters with names like Fjölnir the Brotherless, Olga of the Birch Forest and Finnr the Nose-Stub. The movie has much to recommend it — a powerful cast, certainly, and a different sort of performance from Nicole Kidman, among other things — but it’s a lot. The story, inspired by “Hamlet” (which is based on a Norse legend), is a tale of revenge. King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) returns to his queen, Gudrún (Kidman) and son Amleth (Oscar Novak as a boy). In a genuinely trippy scene, Amleth is prepared for eventually inheriting the throne in a ritual performed by Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe). Thanks to the king’s brother, things do not go as planned. The king’s brother is the aforementioned Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang), which may give you a clue as to how. Amleth flees; the next time we see him he’s rowing in a boat with a bunch of berserker Viking warriors and is played by Alexander Skarsgård. The warriors are particularly good at the whole pillaging thing, as is Amleth. In one village he meets a seeress, a sort of otherworldly fortune teller played to the hilt by Björk, who reminds him that he is all about revenge. Now singleminded of purpose, Amleth stows away on a slave ship headed for Iceland, where his uncle, no longer king in his old land, is a farmer who still wields power. Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and the two become enslaved on Fjölnir’s farm. Here Amleth discovered that Queen Gudrún is now Fjölnir’s wife, and they have children of their own. Amleth sees this as an opportunity not just to avenge his father but to free his mother. This will involve stealth, smarts and savagery. And patience. Skarsgård is good at portraying the put-upon silent type, suffering the slings and arrows of Fjölnir’s oldest son, who has no idea of Amleth’s true identity; he just looks down upon him because that’s how he sees the world. In stories like this, there are always complications, often deadly. That’s what makes them compelling — they aren’t legends for nothing. Eggers is clearly shooting for that sort of stature with the film; there is a volcano threatening to erupt for most of the movie. Wasn’t it Chekhov who said if you put a volcano in the first act then in the following act it should blow? But Eggers spares nothing. The performances are appropriately ferocious, Skarsgård's in particular. He barks, growls and bays at the moon, so dedicated to his mission that at times he is more animal than man. Bang’s performance is subtler, at least in comparison. (If you want a treat, check out Bang’s excellent version of “Dracula,” available for streaming on Netflix. Fantastic.) His Fjölnir is ruthless, yes, but Bang allows us to see at least a hint of humanity. And then there is Kidman. It’s difficult to say much about her performance without spoiling things. But she is not simply a queen devoted to her king. Of all the performances, hers is the most Shakespearian. She can go over the top and somehow stay grounded — it doesn’t feel forced, not acting for acting’s sake. The performance serves the story."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," To say that Robert Eggers’ third feature, The Northman, has a lot to live up to may be an understatement when considering that his first two movies were The Witch and The Lighthouse.  Maybe I was a little slower boarding the Eggers bandwagon than others when those two first movies came out, but I do still remember seeing The Witch when it premiered at Sundance. It would have been hard to forget, since that was the same year I had to go to the hospital with a pneumonia that knocked me out for a few days. When I managed to catch it on a rare second press screening, I was arguably not in top condition. The Northman is a far more ambitious affair, a full-on Viking epic that tries to succeed where previous attempts – sorry, Nicolas Refn’s Valhalla Rising – failed, and thankfully, I got to see it in a better state of health, as well. It’s 895 AD and King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) has returned from war to his loving family. He’s preparing his son Amleth to take over as king, but tragedy befalls when the king’s brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) makes a violent play for the throne, killing Aurvandil, taking Amleth’s mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) as his own wife, and chasing Amleth away. We then cut forward twenty years or more to when Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) is part of a nomadic clan of ruthless barbarians whose sole purpose is to pillage villages. Still seeking vengeance for his father’s death, Amleth disguises himself as a slave to be transported back to Iceland to begin hatching his revenge scheme, gaining the help of a mysterious similarly-enslaved beauty named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy).  There are many intricacies to setting up the story behind The Northman, which Eggers co-wrote with Icelandic poet Sjón (Lamb), but it’s also a relatively simple premise about one man’s thirst for vengeance. It’s something you can discern immediately as the younger Amleth takes on the mantra to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill Fjölnir, something that has driven him for decades well into adulthood. To be honest, you don’t really need to know exactly what happens to whom beyond that, because it is a journey, and it’s one that invites you to explore this world with the filmmaker and his cast but at their own pace and discretion. As I watched The Northman, I couldn’t help but think of Conan the Barbarian, not necessarily the Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jason Momoa movies, as much as the Robert E. Howard books and the many comic books I read as a kid. Eggers gets closer to what I liked about those stories than any other film attempt, and that may be partially due to his attempt to maintain some authenticity to the period and its people, or at least as close as one can get. In some ways, that does put The Northman in a similar rarefied air of cinema as The Green Knight by his former “A24 label-mate” David Lowery, but they are two very different films, for sure. Probably Eggers’ smartest move was casting Skargård, who is perfectly suited and built for the role, and Bang (less recognizable with beard and long hair from his previously dapper roles) is equally well-suited to play his antagonist. Possibly one of Eggers’ greatest early achievements with The Witch is discovering Anya Taylor-Joy, who is back in a particularly terrific supporting but just as important role to Skarsgård. The varied attempts at recreating ancient Norse accents is somewhat of a mixed bag with Skargård and Bang obviously not having to strain too hard, unlike Kidman and even Taylor-Joy, whose accents tend to detract from their performances. (Fans of Icelandic pop star Bjork will just have to contend with the disappointment that she’s really only in one single scene in the film.) Even so, it’s impossible not to appreciate the visuals Eggers and his team have created in telling this story, as his crafts team that has really outdone itself in creating both the worlds grounded in reality, and also the film’s more supernatural and fantasy elements. Where The Northman’s story and pace really pick up and thereby makes it easier for the film to win over the doubters until that point is the final act when Amleth starts to enact his revenge on Fjölnir. Again, there’s no need to go into the (literally) gory details, but it’s the kind of payoff most will be hoping for after such a lengthy build-up. At times, The Northman may be a chore to fully absorb, but it’s a movie with a scale and scope that can be fully appreciated through visuals that keep you riveted to the screen. It might feel a bit like a slow build, but you’ll know pretty quickly if you’re the kind of person Eggers is trying to reach with his distinctive storytelling. As with Eggers’ other films, The Northman is not a movie for those who don’t consider themselves at least slightly adventurous and open-minded."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," It would not have been surprising if creative and commercial tensions had torn this sleet-walloped Viking epic into bloody ribbons. Robert Eggers comes to his third feature after stimulating adventurous taste buds with The Witch and The Lighthouse. Few such arthouse directors get to expand their aesthetic with a budget over twice that of the season's Michael Bay film. Yet Eggers really has been given $90 million (€83 million) – Bay's current, LA-annihilating Ambulance cost about $40 million (€37 million) – and The Northman, filmed largely in Ireland, is every bit as crunchy, awkward and unsettling as his first two films. You couldn’t quite argue that “every cent is on the screen”. A few computer-generated shots feel thin. We are dealing with a cast of hundreds rather than thousands. But few recent films on this scale have bustled with such intelligence and invention. They may not be making them like this for much longer. Those entering with no prior knowledge will find a familiar story rapidly folding around them. We begin with young Prince Amleth welcoming home his warrior king father (an uncharacteristically burly Ethan Hawke) from the usual Viking slaughters. All seems comfortable enough, but intrigue is brewing. Amleth watches horrified as his father’s brother (Claes Bang) murders the boy’s dad and shacks up with his apparently unwilling mother (Nicole Kidman). He flees for foreign climes, grows to be a man, and, now in the mountainous form of Alexander Skarsgård, plots his dreadful revenge. Can you see what it is yet? Working with the Icelandic writer Sjón, Eggers has adapted his screenplay from Saxo Grammaticus's 13th-century Amleth, a source for Hamlet, and, though the procrastination here is mostly involuntary, echoes of Shakespeare resound throughout the story. Willem Dafoe could hardly be better cast as a bawdy jester who, after fulfilling his duties as a variation on Lear's Fool, gets dug up as wormy version of Yorick. Kidman, her mellifluousness betraying a steely edge, grabs the opportunity for an informal Gertrude with indecent eagerness. Skarsgård gets to stir himself in the odd soliloquy. The fug of incest and corruption suits an already ailing dynasty. The film’s early shape is, however, closer to that of a more violent Ben-Hur or a less campy Conan the Barbarian. Like Judah Ben-Hur, Amleth spends time behind an oar before returning as a slave to succeed at his captors’ deranged public games. Rather than chariot racing, he plays a sport that has almost as much in common with rollerball as it does with hurling. Players smash opponents in the face with sticks as they seek to transport a ball to a rude post. All this is good clean homicidal fun. Before that, charting Amleth's time with a party of berserkers, Eggers deals in less jokey mayhem that conjures up uncomfortable reminders of current outrages. Using lengthy single takes, transporting us past barely glimpsed horrors, cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, Oscar-nominated for The Lighthouse, follows the party inland to a Slavic village where Amleth participates in what we would now adjudge a war crime. The Northman does not sell its empathy cheaply. A few centuries of exposure to the formal theatrical tragedies have prepared us for the story’s inevitable narrative arcs. But the richness of Eggers’s historical ventriloquism ensures there is never a dull moment. No previous film has, we are reliably informed, been so accurate in its recreation of Norse life. Even those unconcerned with such things will be won over by the richness and weirdness of the cluttered fabric. This is a world in which the mystical and the supernatural are woven in with the everyday. Björk is here as a seeress who knows more than she should. Branches of the sacred tree Yggdrasil link the protagonist with past and future. The final conflagration connects with nature at its most diabolically unforgiving. Perhaps Eggers has lost some of the horrible intimacy we savoured in his earlier work. But he offers us compensation in scope, intensity and pure bloody ferocity. We need hardly note that the extreme violence will not be for everyone. Never fear. The new Downton Abbey movie will be along in a moment."

Starring Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke, Anya Taylor-Joy, Gustav Lindh, Elliott Rose, Willem Dafoe, Phill Martin, Olwen Fouéré, Eldar Skar, Edgar Abram, Jack Gassmann, Ingvar E.

From visionary director Robert Eggers comes The Northman, an action-filled epic that follows a young Viking prince on his quest to avenge his father’s murder. Coming from writer and visionary director Robert Eggers (The Witch and The Lighthouse), the simplistic narrative nature of The Northman is shocking. However, simplicity is something one can afford so long as they are masters of their craft and capable of utterly annihilating our senses (think insane tracking shots during battle or for immersion purposes, meticulously researched Viking lore, arresting photography, and obsessive levels of period piece detail). It’s an epic visual and aural experience operating on the same wavelength of primal rage as its protagonist. There is also the bonus that Robert Eggers (this time co-writing with Lamb‘s Sjón) doesn’t tell glorifying tales. If he is doing a revenge story involving Vikings, you are getting Vikings at their most animalistic and brutal, alongside a plethora of fascinating and marvelously realized mysticism pulling from various in-depth researched corners of Norse mythology. Playing up hypermasculinity once again, The Northman is self-aware of how absurd the characters’ beliefs are. One of the first things Ethan Hawke’s King Aurvandil War Raven tells his young princely child Amleth is that he refuses to die from illness and that should he die in battle, the boy’s life will be dedicated to avenging that loss. Complete with Willem Dafoe making a glorified cameo as a jester servant, this plot thread is played straight but not without its humorous qualities. Hell, immediately after putting his son through physically intense coming-of-age Viking rituals, there is a cut to the King instantly getting murdered, as if Robert Eggers is winking to the audience about the silliness of such masculine creeds. Beyond that, the story is no laughing matter, and all the better for it. Flash forward to “years later,” where a grown-up Amleth is played by a shredded Alexander Skarsgård, having abandoned his land to join a pack of killers and thieves that behave more like bears and wolves than humans. On that note, everyone is operating on a twisted moral compass here (although Amleth does draw a line at killing women and children). One could say Amleth is running from his fate, as a creepy seeress (Bjork) points out, eventually leading him to disguise himself as one of the enslaved to make his way to the property of his uncle Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang, crushing what feels like one of the first major American roles of his career), who kidnapped Amleth’s mother Queen Gudrún (a thickly accented Nicole Kidman who is turned loose in unexpected ways) after murdering for the crown. While stowing away on one of the slave ships, Amleth also becomes smitten with Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga of the Birch Forest, primarily existing as a love interest but wisely not written to lose her dignity at every corner at the hands of the enslavers (you know a lesser film would be all about punishing her at the expense of further enraging Amleth, but here, Olga stands her ground about as much as anyone in her position can). Robert Eggers also uses this brief downtime to explore sheep farming Viking life and a deadly sport that leaves Amleth delivering a series of visceral headbutts, just in case one needed a reminder that the violence here is sadistic and beastly. There is also a quest for a special sword tied to Amleth’s fate that makes for an effectively placed and briefly thrilling side adventure expanding on more myths. It’s not long before Amleth faces serious decisions regarding kinship and revenge, barreling towards a fiery conclusion. And throughout every scene, The Northman is charged up to ramming speed by a propulsive, adrenaline-pumping score from Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough that lends a dramatic weight to nearly every interaction. The soundtrack and sound design are both downright mesmerizing, as is the brutality sweepingly captured by regular Robert Eggers collaborating cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (lensing one of the most atmospheric and to-die-for badass final sword fighting confrontations in quite some time). Yes, it’s safe to say that The Northman offers a riveting and grimy, sensational spectacle that straddles the line between eerie and fist-pumping. Admittedly, the story does settle into a relatively systematic study of cycles of violence passed down from men to their sons at unsettlingly young ages and the necessity of breaking such a chain. There is a feeling that Robert Eggers could have done something slightly more original with the material than a straight-up revenge story, but as it stands, this is the template masterfully elevated by flooring craftsmanship in every aspect of filmmaking. It is the performance of a lifetime for Alexander Skarsgård, balancing the primal with a newfound softer side and a desire to cut the ties that bind just as much as the head off of the man that took everything from him as a child. The Northman is an exhilarating, unrelenting, authentically barbaric tale of rage and romance."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Three features in, it’s beginning to look as if the much thrown around and overused term, “visionary,” can be applied with a great deal of justification to writer-director Robert Eggers. His new film The Northman follows in the footsteps of his two previous efforts, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019), both of which created wholly immersive, fully detailed portraits of life in specific historical settings while exploring the thin line between the natural and the supernatural. The Northman takes much the same direction, only in the most epic scale that Eggers has worked with yet. Set in 10th-century Scandinavia and Iceland, the film is truly breathtaking in its scope, its detail, and, again, its completely immersive quality. You don’t doubt for a second that you are anywhere but the time and place in which the film is set. And like its predecessors, The Northman also suggests that any barrier between the real world and the realms beyond was much more porous back then. The film opens in the fictional kingdom of Hrafnsey where King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) returns from a campaign of conquest to his wife Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) and his 10-year-old son Amleth (Oscar Novak). Aurvandill decides it’s time for Amleth to begin his preparations to eventually inherit the throne, subjecting him to a psychedelic initiation ritual designed to bring out his inner “wolf.” But no sooner is the ritual complete than Amleth sees his father murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who also seizes Gudrún and calls for the death of Amleth. The boy flees by sea in a small boat, vowing to enact his revenge on Fjölnir and rescue his mother. When we meet him again roughly 20 years later (and now played by Alexander Skarsgård), he is a near-bestial member of a Viking berserker party raiding and pillaging Slavic towns in eastern Europe. After being reminded in a vision by a seeress (Bjork) of his promise, Amleth discovers that his uncle now presides over a large farm in Iceland. Amleth infiltrates a group of captured slaves being sent to Fjölnir’s land, where with the help of an alluring, enigmatic Slavic slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), he carefully maps out his vengeance. Co-written by Eggers and Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón, The Northman has been described as a “timeless” tale, which in fact it is. Its roots go back to ancient Icelandic sagas and Viking legends, which in turn have found themselves integrated into stories like Beowulf and Hamlet, and right down to modern variations such as The Lion King. But it’s also a timeworn tale, and perhaps the biggest weakness in Eggers’ otherwise remarkably fleshed out, often gripping film is that the narrative is an overly familiar one, right down to an ostensibly surprising late reveal. In that sense, because the path for all the characters is so set in archetypal stone, it’s difficult to invest in anyone’s fate when we’ve seen the outcome play out in many earlier iterations of this classic revenge scenario. Whereas The Witch and The Lighthouse offered unexpected takes on the supernatural stories they were telling, The Northman rarely deviates from its pre-ordained path. It’s difficult to fully relate to Amleth as well, although there’s no question that Skarsgård gives his all to the role. But Amleth as portrayed here is practically a human monster, hulking, massive, and full of a simmering rage that can explode at any moment into shocking violence. Skarsgård’s sheer physicality in the role, along with his skills wielding various weapons, are quite impressive, even if his emotional center remains encased within. We have no doubt that this was the life of a Norseman in the 10th century, but it makes his quiet moments with Taylor-Joy’s Olga all the more jarring (the latter brings her usual luminous presence to a role that is somewhat underwritten, but she still holds the screen whenever she’s on). Skarsgård is almost a cross in modern terms between Thor and the Hulk, and if nothing else, The Northman gives us a glimpse of what the actor might have looked like as the MCU’s God of Thunder had he beaten out Chris Hemsworth for the role. While there’s an additional layer of complexity missing from Skarsgård’s performance, Kidman and Bang provide more nuanced takes on their characters. Bang in particular does some subtle, interesting work as Fjölnir, portraying him in the film’s second half as somewhat more sympathetic and introspective (insofar as a Viking slave owner and murderer of his brother can be seen that way) but still deeply haunted by the actions he’s taken in his life. Kidman is a cypher for a good deal of the running time, but eventually shows the fortitude and self-possession probably necessary for a woman to carve any life out for herself in this era. While the story’s inevitability makes the film feel long as it inches towards its conclusion, one is still never bored thanks to Eggers’ incredible mastery of atmosphere, tone, and imagery. The windswept, desolate, eerily majestic landscapes of Iceland fill one’s eyes continuously while the stylized sequences of plunder, battle, and even gaming (with all three blending into each other in terms of their violent nature) are strikingly lit and choreographed. The scenes in which the grounded world crosses into the realm of the mystical and supernatural–often through visions, potion-induced hallucinations, or outright manifestations–are also powerfully conceived and executed, with psychedelia, primeval magic, and natural beauty combined for an often awe-inspiring tableaux that channels both Norse mythology and something more nameless and ancient. Also awe-inspiring is the film’s violence and gore. Be warned, The Northman goes as hard as an R-rated movie can go, with beheadings, disembowelments, stabbings, beatings, torture, rape, immolation, and the sacrificial killing of animals a constant throughout the film. But even then, Eggers stages much of it in painterly fashion, including a battle royale set in a flaming landscape that captures both the raw power of nature and the barbaric fury of the men fighting in its lap. Eggers told Den of Geek magazine, “The intention is for this to be the Viking movie,” and in many ways he’s done that. The Northman is one hell of a lot of Viking movie, and there’s no question that Eggers, Skarsgård, Kidman, Sjón, Taylor-Joy, and the rest of the cast and crew leave it all out there on the bloody, muddy field. But in sticking to a tried-and-true narrative, the director does a slight injustice to all the other riveting elements of his most ambitious and, yes, visionary production yet."

LOS ANGELES, April 11 (UPI) -- The Northman, in theaters April 22, is like a Viking Conan movie. Conan was a barbarian in a fantasy world, while Robert Eggers' new film delivers thrills with a historical basis.
As a child, Amleth (Oscar Novak) admires his warrior-king father, Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). Aurvandil trains Amleth in animal behavior and commands that his son avenge him should he die in battle, which soon comes to pass.

Aurvandil's brother, Fjolnir (Claes Bang), murders the king and kidnaps his queen, Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). When Amleth grows up into the body of Alexander Skarsgard, he returns for revenge.
Director Eggers doesn't shy away from the violence of Viking battles, yet it never feels gratuitous. The Northman presents Fjolnir's attack from young Amleth's point of view, on the ground, hiding from the worst atrocities.
Amleth still practices his animal rage as an adult. When he leads a clan to attack a village, it's not pretty.
A hulking, bloody Skarsgard makes quite an engrossing action hero. He performs some physical feats in single takes that either are impressively practiced or seamlessly enhanced with visual effects. That you can't tell which makes the action compelling.

Amleth's new clan still rapes the women whose village they conquer, so it's not like they're noble warriors. Fortunately, Eggers moves the camera as soon as you realize what's going on, so it's honest about the world of Viking battle without exploiting it.
Posing as a slave to get passage back to Fjolnir's kingdom, Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who becomes an ally. Of course, when he finally gets there, revenge proves to be not quite as simple as he imagined it as a child.
The action keeps ramping up, including gaping battle wounds and disembowlings. Eggers, who co-wrote the script with Sjon, includes just enough mysticism to feel epic without breaking the grounded reality of The Northman.
Like his 17th-century New England horror movie The Vvitch, Eggers fills The Northman with authentic details. Title cards in Norse language and a few subtitled sections give a sense of language lost to time.
Granted, they would not be speaking English in 895 AD, but the accents feel as researched and crafted as possible without losing the entire audience. Eggers skillfully chooses just enough detail to keep The Northman feeling accessible to 2022 viewers.
The Northman is a refreshingly R-rated historical adventure like the days of Braveheart and Gladiator. Plus, it looks like they staged battles around real locations in England and Iceland, so The Northman really stands out from the glut of movies that use green-screens for computer-generated special effects.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Describing “The Northman” as director Robert Eggers' most accessible film verges on misleading. The filmmaker's prior works—the puritanical hallucinations of “The Witch” and the desolate, mermaid fetishization of “The Lighthouse”—traded in traditional macabre American folklore for unconventional, ambient freak-outs. “The Northman” repeats the best instincts of those films, though to lesser effect. It demands audiences deconstruct overbearing patriarchal values, toxic masculine heroism, and the folly of revenge by pulling viewers through extreme devotion to familial honor. Eggers’ brand of psychological shock is bolder here than his prior works and potent in bursts, but barely works on boldness alone. When Eggers first released “The Witch” his brand of horror was deemed, backhandedly, as “elevated.” The New England filmmaker delivered genre-breaking frights with a fresh devil-may-care glee for the sinister that pushed the sonic and visual possibilities of supernatural angst. With “The Northman,” Eggers uses slicker aesthetics and broader emotions, played out over a grander scale, with his familiar interests in the inherent weirdness that courses through ancient mythology. It’s the tale of Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a hulking, enraged Viking warrior prince who’s seeking retribution for a lost kingdom in Scandinavia. Modern audiences will know this legend by its well-known English adaptation, Hamlet, recalling unbreakable Amleth’s resolve, as unforgiving as the punishing landscape, to earn back his usurped crown.  ""The Northman"" is the kind of movie where even the mud has rage; it is a visceral film filled with codas to the inescapable darker regions of nature: animal, elemental and the harshest of all, human. They all vibrate through Eggers’ signature warped soundscapes and Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s brooding score, as ambient reverbs and decaying delays reach back toward primordial origins. The trippy hypnotic dreamscapes attempt a similar reach: the crack VFX team render Amleth’s family tree, an ever-evolving stand-in for divine rule, as a blue glowing arterial fern arising from his heart while connecting to ours. It’s one of the many magical tendrils intertwining, and sometimes knotting up, “The Northman,” a film where Björk portrays a blind seer pointing Amleth toward a sword with a dull-less blade and an unquenchable thirst for death.  In that regard, “The Northman” often stumbles when it searches for profundity. As much as Eggers and his co-writer, the poet and novelist Sjón (“Lamb”), want to interrogate the place of women in these myths, that component bobs unmoored just below the surface. Outside of one spell, Olga remains within the confines of genre conventions without wholly subverting them. The last act is a slog, composed of a couple false endings hoping to attain a poetic plain. The final showdown between Fjölnir and Amleth, in the mouth of a volcano, in fact, is somehow anti-climactic. Certainly, the scene aims to explain the ways a hero’s journey, the expectation of fulfilling one’s destiny, no matter the consequences, carries a toxic burden, but the sentiment doesn’t translate in the overstated molten brouhaha. Instead, this gory Viking tale works when considering its parts, but never really as a whole. The parts, however, are so thrilling, so uniquely calibrated to feverish, determined ends, that they elevate the entire film. Because how can one complain about the ""too muchness"" of the Valkyries? How can one scoff at the dizzying, unexplainable flights of magic? Where would the fun be in that? “The Northman” makes you happy it exists, even if you’re not totally happy with it.  Robert Daniels is an Associate Editor at RogerEbert.com.

"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL," he year is 895 A.D. King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) has returned home to his Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman) and their young son Amleth after a grueling campaign against their adversaries. But unbeknownst to him, his most dangerous enemy resides even closer – his brother Fjolnir (Claes Bang), who soon betrays the throne, killing Aurvandil and taking Gudrun for himself. Amleth narrowly manages to escape the slaughter, swearing an oath to take revenge on the man that upended his world. Years pass, finding an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) now razing villages with his adopted Viking family in the Land of the Rus. When he encounters a mysterious Seeress (Bjork) who reminds him of his promise of vengeance, Amleth realizes he cannot escape his destiny. Learning of Fjolnir’s whereabouts, the relentless warrior disguises himself as a prisoner and boards a boat headed to Iceland. Once there, with the aid of the enchanting maiden Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the will of the gods themselves, Amleth sets into motion his bloodthirsty plot to avenge his father’s murder. Though it immediately resembles “The Lighthouse” with its black-and-white palette and foggy waterfront views, suddenly a splash of color dances across the screen, suggesting that this may be a higher-contrast design. Oddly, despite the brief glimpses of reds and greens, much of the film remains dark and turbid, revealing an exceptionally unglamorous interpretation of Viking lore (save for the physically fit cast). Yet the cinematography intermittently reminds of Wes Anderson, as the characters tend to be perfectly centered in the frame, background objects move in parallel to dollying motions, and the majority of the conversations are conducted as if speaking directly into the camera; it’s almost as if the intention is to remove any sense of three-dimensionality during tighter shots, generating incredibly flat compositions. At other, rarer moments – chiefly with wide angles – the environments play a major part, using rain, snow, fire, ice, mud, and greenery (often mixed with sweat and spittle) to highlight or augment the griminess of the era. It’s clearly a tremendously artistic approach to the ninth century, despite the straightforward adaptation of sets, makeup, costuming, and armory. Even the abundance of rites and rituals are likely authentic, though writer/director Robert Eggers dwells on these entirely too much, letting the camera linger long after the somewhat spellbinding weirdness of chanting and dancing and witchery have shifted into monotony. The runtime could have been noticeably shortened if the repetitiousness of these ancient customs, which translates poorly to modern viewers’ senses of awe, were simply trimmed down. “Let this misdeed haunt your living nights.” Flowery, Shakespearean, contemporary dialogue gives the picture an undeniable realism – perhaps removing all the fantasy and adventure from something as over-the-top as “Conan the Barbarian” – yet the script still pauses at regular intervals to have characters explain the specifics of their intentions and missions. It’s as if Eggers is afraid that audiences will miss plot points, and so must reiterate them with less elaborate words. Problematically, however, the plot is unusually basic; the notion of a betrayed youth growing up to avenge his wrongdoers is just too commonplace. Even with the constant reveries, flashbacks, and hallucinations, joined by notes of mysticism, prophecies, and inalterable fate, the premise presents few surprises. Eggers may not have had the ability to stay true to his vision, as the larger budget (typically tied to studio interference) surely persuaded him to embrace more complex, commercially viable combat sequences to spice up what could have been an otherwise punishingly slow revenge epic; or perhaps the balancing act between action and symbolism isn’t his forte. Nevertheless, “The Northman” boasts astonishingly graphic violence, making the most of axe-wielding, sword-slashing, and throat-cutting – all of which tend to draw fans. But when brutality isn’t the focus, the film vacillates between the atmosphere and storytelling of “Braveheart,” “Spartacus,” Roger Corman’s tatty peplum pictures “Deathstalker” and “Barbarian Queen,” “Krull,” “Sleepy Hollow,” some of the mythological works of Harryhausen, and the very recent David Lowery release “The Green Knight.” There’s mild satisfaction to be found in some of the destructive confrontations, but plenty of dawdling and bewildering returns to bizarre ceremonies foster a dullness that surely won’t align with mainstream audiences’ expectations for thrilling Viking exploits.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Acclaimed writer-director Robert Eggers (The Witch, The Lighthouse) delivers a visually stunning Viking saga in his third and best feature yet. Based on the medieval Scandinavian legend of Amleth - the origin story for Shakespearian tragedy Hamlet - The Northman was co-written by Eggers and Sjón, the multitalented writer, lyricists and longtime creative partner to Icelandic pop icon Björk.  Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård (True Blood, Mute, Passing)heads an all-star cast featuring outstanding turns from Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch, The Queen's Gambit, Emma), Nicole Kidman, Ethan Hawke and award winning Danish actor Claes Bang (The Square). Bjork (Dancer in the Dark) and legendary Hollywood actor Willem Defoe also star. Prince Amleth (played by Oscar Novak as a child) is on the verge of becoming a man when his father the king (Hawke, sublime) is brutally murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Bang) who also kidnaps the young boy's mother, queen Gudrún (Kidman). Two decades later, now a fearless and Viking fighter, Amleth (Skarsgård) vows to avenge his father’s death when he learns that his uncle has fled to Iceland after losing his kingdom and crown.  Disguised as a slave, Amleth reaches Iceland where rich land-owner Fjölnir has been living an idyllic rural life with Gudrún, their young son Gunnar and Fjölnir’s oldest son. After proving himself to be worthy of keeping as a slave, Amelth forms a strong bond with the strikingly beautiful Olga (Taylor-Joy), a powerful Slavic sorceress sold to slavery by her Viking captors. But not even Olga’s love can stop the young man from pursuing his deadly feud with his uncle.  This may be his third ever feature, but Eggers has already proven himself to be in a class of his own. Here, he has delivered an unflinchingly brutal, raw and genuinely thrilling tale of vengeance and passion. The US born filmmaker mixes Norse Mythology wIth medieval Scandinavian history to give us a brilliantly innovative art film which is worth every single penny of its rumoured $90 million budget. Elevated by Jarin Blaschke’s stunning cinematography and by Eggers’ impressive technical dexterity, The Northman feels like a spine-chilling fever-dream where the lines between reality and fantasy are often blurred and where the mysticism is depicted in the most gloriously tripped-out, haunting and spooky fashion.  Alexander Skarsgård puts in a career-best performance as a young man consumed by his thirst for vengeance, while Anya Taylor-Joy is simply mesmeric as Olga, proving once again that she is here to stay. Overall, this is truly a film not to be missed. Eggers has once again delivered the goods in what is likely to be the best film of the year so far. And while some might be put off by its brutality and graphic violence, The Northman remains the most honest and the most easily believable Viking-themed movie any of us are ever likely to experience. Genuinely thrilling from start to finish. "

Thank Odin, then, for Robert Eggers and his mad, brilliant, violent, hypnotic, trippy Viking opus. And thank the heroic people who gave him $80 million to make it. A thrilling revenge movie with one foot in a to-the-last-detail recreation of 9th century Scandinavia and one in a supernatural realm of hulking zombie vikings, magic swords and Björk playing a prophet in a wheat hat, it’s Conan the Barbarian by way of Klimov and Tarkovsky. It’s artful and full of haunting, elemental visuals – for all the talk of studio notes, this feels like a work of singular vision – but it also gallops along at times, as it follows raging prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård, about the size of an Ikea) as he hunts down the uncle (Claes Bang, terrific) who killed his dad and made off with his mum. The Northman feels Shakespearean (it draws on the same Norse material as ‘Hamlet’), especially when Nicole Kidman’s queen is on screen. She’s clearly having a blast with a character who is never entirely moored to the world she inhabits or any traditional gender role. It leaves Anya Taylor-Joy’s sorceress, Olga, as our sanctuary from all the male bloodletting. The battles are brutal and there are moments when everyone on screen seems to be avenging someone else.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," A hoard of outcast Vikings pillages a small town towards the end of the first act of Robert Egger’s The Northman. We see their blood soaked brutality savage an entire Slavic community, as we watch a young protagonist, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), kill men defending this city against the invasion he and his fellow makeshift warriors are commanded to do. There are no morals to these actions, this is a time of divide and concur, where there were no negotiations. Within this mayhem, as the last enemy has been slain, Amleth, sees a son ripped away from his mother. As her cries bellow throughout the center of the city, the camera moves with the young man as it leads him to a similar predicament Amleth finds himself into now. The town burning to the ground, we realize that through this violence is a vicious circle of horrific sadness that runs deep in this world, where revenge dominants all judgements, and clouds the main character’s mind. Somber and still, Amleth realizes the ramifications his actions lead to, that of a broken world, loss of all whom he holds dear, leaving him with nothing but anger in place of where his heart used to be. Thus he must right the wrongs of the past in order to prevent moments like this from happening again. Years before he was a cunning, skilled combatant, Amleth was a prince, set to rule the kingdom his father King Aurvandill War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) presides over. His mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), watches him like a hawk, making sure he is ready to take the thrown for his father, whose lust for combat could lead to his downfall. Upon the kings return from battle, with his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang) by his side, the father-son duo embrace and set out later in the night, after much celebrating, into the darkness of a nearby forest to perform a ritual that will bond them as more than family, but as kings. With the assistance of the king’s fool Heimir (Willem Dafoe), this act is completed with the condition of Amleth swearing to the gods that if his father is killed, he will avenge him. As it ends, and they are leaving the sacred grounds, they are ambushed, though Amleth is able to escape just enough to see his uncle Fjölnir betray his family and the throne by killing King Aurvandill, and taking his place upon the throne, and kidnapping Queen Gudrún as his own bride. Racing out of the forest, through the place he called home, landing into a small boat, Amleth heart turns black, and thus his lust for retribution is born. “I will avenge you Father. I will save you Mother. I will kill you Fjölnir,” he repeats as a mantra. And so, as a grown man, after a vision by a seeress (Björk, making a rare return to film) reminding him of his oath, he realizes he is more than ready to go toe to toe with any obstacle in his way to get the vindication for his father and mother. He disguises himself as a slave on a ship heading towards an island where his uncle has deserted to after his traitorous actions lead to his dismissal of being king and forced him into exile, with Queen Gurdún and his two sons. Along the way, he builds a partnership that leads to romance with a fellow slave named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress whom helps him carry out his revenge. As he arrives and he builds trust with Fjölnir and those around him, this is when Amleth strikes, trying to find his internal and ancestral satisfaction, one slash of his mighty sword at a time. Much of The Northman’s 136-minute runtime is spent delicately juggling between being two kinds of movies. The first movie is a Robert Eggers movie. If you have seen the last two efforts from this indie filmmaker, The Witch and The Lighthouse, then you already know he is not the most conventional of artists. Within whatever subject matter, time period and location he is presenting his audience, Eggers builds a wholly original world that you may have never seen before, and brings a unique voice we are desperately in need of in modern cinema. He’s one of the most detailed oriented directors working today and you can see every ounce of that attention to detail presented in every frame of this film. While it does feel like some creative concessions were made given the grand scale of this project, there is no denying that fans of the director will be left satisfied given how grand and gorgeous it looks and feels thanks to Egger’s vision alongside Jarin Blaschke’s cinematography. The second is a traditional, $75M Hollywood epic set in the world of Vikings, with a story taken straight out of Shakespearian lore: Hamlet the greatest story ever told about revenge. Eggers and co-writer Sjón use this familiar tale to tell a new story about male rage and the naiveté surrounding the notion of a child’s revenge being far more complicated than they could’ve ever imagined. By doing this, it brings into question the ideas of idols and how holding up people, the most flawed creature to ever roam our planet, to outrageous expectations can lead to a sense of loneliness and confusion, thus being psychologically trapped. When revelations of his family’s past are presented at his feet, Amleth is shook to his core, and thus has to learn that it’s not about correcting the past, but about making a future worth protecting, even if the results of both paths intersect. It’s powerful, profound and touching when this simple, efficient story and brilliant acting all comes together in the end with one of the best final face offs we’ve seen in some time, lead by a impressive duel to the death mixed with a pulse-pounding score by composers Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough. It doesn’t always succeed in its balancing act, as the two halves seem a little distanced from each other but this is a minor hiccup in an otherwise grand experience. The Northman is a brooding, fierce revenge flick and a bold, modern epic made by a unique visionary storyteller that simultaneously challenges and entertains."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Sharpen the swords and prepare the funeral pyres: A Viking is out for bloody revenge in “The Northman,” and the corpses keep piling higher and higher in this trippy action epic from director and co-writer Robert Eggers (“The Lighthouse”). Written in collaboration with Icelandic author Sjón (“Lamb,” “Dancer in the Dark”), “The Northman” is gory, muddy, hallucinatory — and intensely entertaining. An examination of the way that violence begets violence, and a study of how a life devoted to single-minded hatred and vengeance can lead to uncomfortable truths, this is a movie that lives up to every saga comic books and metal bands ever spun about the brutal conquerors of yore. We open on young Prince Amieth (Oscar Novak, “The Batman”) running to tell his mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) of the return of King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), whose arrival is celebrated with a feast that includes japery from court jester Heimir (Willem Dafoe). Aurvandil and Heimir soon initiate young Amieth into a ritual that allows him to tap into his inner wolf, and the timing couldn’t be better: Aurvandil is soon thereafter assassinated by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang, “The Square”), leaving the prince to flee in a rowboat, vowing to murder Fjölnir and one day rescue Gudrún from his clutches. As an adult, Amieth (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) uses that wolf power as part of a marauding band that conquers a village and sells off its inhabitants into slavery. When he realizes that the hardiest of the captives are being sold to Fjölnir — now a farmer and Freyja-cultist after being displaced from his throne — Amieth brands himself and joins the slaves, eager to fulfill his lifelong quest. Along the way, he falls in love with captive Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), but coming face to face with his nemesis (and reuniting with his beloved mother) winds up being a far more complicated affair that Amieth could ever have predicted. Eggers and his director of photography Jarin Blaschke are now three-for-three at making films that unfold in harsh and unforgiving natural settings that seem to defy human occupation. After the banquet in Aurvandil’s honor, there’s never a moment in which anyone on screen looks warm, comfortable or sufficiently fed, and in this case, the brutality of the surroundings feeds the single-minded intensity of Amieth and his quest. Practically every shot in “The Northman” is gorgeous, but Blaschke’s lighting, particularly in the night sequences, brings dread and unease into that beauty, matching the intricate but unsettling sound design from supervising sound editor Steve Little and his team. Editor Louise Ford (“Things Heard & Seen”) knows how to draw out moments of grandeur (the sailing of long ships, characters trudging the epic Icelandic countryside) while also giving the moments of violence the appropriate shock and intensity, from jarring hand-to-hand combat to Amieth’s secret nighttime assaults on Fjölnir’s compound. (There’s also an athletic sequence, involving a bone-breaking, ninth-century version of cricket that makes you want to see Eggers’ take on a sports movie.) As with his previous two films, Eggers knows how to bring the actors to the specifically weird wavelength of his stories, and the ensemble commits absolutely to inhabiting this world and conveying the passions and obsessions of the characters. Skarsgård goes borderline feral for big portions of the film, but there’s never a sense of indulgent posturing; he provides a path of understanding what drives Amieth, even as the character plunges into animalistic ferocity. As in Eggers’ debut feature, Taylor-Joy’s wide eyes and otherworldly quality allow her to convey with conviction the idea of a woman with powers on a mystical plane. Olga may not match Amieth in physical intimidation, but she shares his commitment to the destruction of their shared enemy. Kidman rarely gets the credit she deserves for going out on a limb and seeking opportunities to work with envelope-pushing directors. Like Catherine Deneuve, Kidman embraces eccentric characterizations guided by filmmakers working outside the mainstream, and she often reaps the benefits with indelible supporting roles like this one that enhance her reputation as an unpredictable and engrossing performer, a movie star who’s always a character actress at heart. “The Northman” is the best kind of multi-quadrant movie. Without abandoning his arthouse credentials, Eggers has made a rousingly rough, extreme action saga that has the potential of attracting the kind of viewers who might have found his previous work impenetrable. It’s a vision of futility and fury, of a clash between nature and humanity where violence is both the means and the consequence, and an ancient revenge fantasy that speaks with terrible truth to this moment and to the historical lessons we never seem to learn."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," You’ve certainly never seen a Hamlet quite like this before. To a backdrop of volcanoes spewing their applause, heads roll liberally in The Northman, several tumbling from big-name actors who’ve been enticed, understandably, by the film’s wild take on Viking mythology, its unabashed epic scale. It roars and grunts, lunges and spurts.  It’s a huge leap up in canvas size for Robert Eggers, whose previous films The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019) were made on a fraction of this $90m budget. With his co-writer Sjón, an Icelandic poet-novelist, Eggers has taken the legend of Amleth, the warrior prince whose revenge inspired Shakespeare, and fashioned a film of savage, unruly beauty. Corpses are crushed into mud or dangle like sadistic wall art. In nude moments of respite, hot springs wash off the crusted gore of foes. At no point does a rampant Alexander Skarsgård, in the lead role, look tempted to break off for any soul-searching soliloquies, that’s for sure.  Assumed dead by his uncle Fjölnir (a hirsute Claes Bang), Amleth has motives of both revenge and rescue exploding inside his skull. After watching his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), slaughtered when he was a mere boy, he saw his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), carried off screaming. Eggers handles these triggering events in a first act that manages to be both efficient and tellingly bonkers. As a kind of Yorick of the longhall, Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe) is introduced waggling his bits. Bonding between father and son occurs in a grotto, with both on all fours howling like rabid dogs.  We haven’t even reached Björk as “The Seeress” – basically all three Macbeth witches in one. She burbles her prophecies with a giant wheatsheaf for a headdress, and a necklace of random cowrie shells. It’s not as if you hire Björk and expect her to show up in skivvies. The middle act establishes’s Amleth’s Conan the Barbarian credentials: there’s an absolute shedload of pillaging. Whole communities are shoved in barns and torched to death. Nothing satiates this displaced antihero, a hard man to converse with intellectually, or to divert even momentarily from bashing absolutely everyone’s brains out. Pointed towards Valhalla, the film’s mystical dimension is not exactly profound; its brutal action gets intentionally ludicrous. The way the story reroutes our expectations, especially towards Gudrún, and Amleth’s sidekick sorceress Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, self-possessed as ever), is the real kicker.  The set of Kidman’s jaw is so severe it’s alien – terrifying. She’s off-screen for a little too long, but then there’s a blazing rendition of the Act III bedchamber scene which could hardly be less tender: she ends it cackling like a maniac. To date, Eggers’s aesthetic has had a harsh singularity – there’s nothing quite like those other two films. This sells itself somewhat differently. It’s a mash-up of many cinematic formulae – never far from the meathead epics of Mel Gibson (or Gladiator); but dabbling too in the trippy mysticism of The Fountain. It reminds you of everything and nothing. Rumours of recuts and difficult testing haven’t reduced its essence: like Skarsgård’s brawny frame, it stands more than tall enough at 137 minutes. It comes at you with whopping set-pieces and a ragged, reckless sense of structure.  Before his return, there’s a great sword that Amleth must retrieve from an undead adversary in a cave – a kind of Green Knight side hustle, while we hold our breath. A prophecy from a He-Witch (Ingvar Eggert Sigurösson) is perhaps a heebie-jeebie interlude too far. The wobbles never last too long, though. The Northman goes OTT with relish – it’s never knowingly undercooked. Eggers’s climax mounts the face-off we’ve all been waiting for, across fissures of molten lava at the end of the Earth, with two mortal enemies bellowing their heads off.  Something in Skarsgård’s expression, lingered on for long beats, gives us a sense of monumental waste, of a human soul spent in furious, ransacking grievance. And for what? This is nihilism as rowdy spectacle, fed to the animal in us all."

	'The Witch' director Robert Eggers has vision to burn, but robs this brutal 10th-century revenge story of the tragic twist it needs to hook us emotionally. Fields glow kryptonite green against volcanic black soil, while not-so-distant mountains smoke and spew hot red lava above the heads of hardy sheep. Nowhere else on Earth looks like Iceland, which is why so many productions over the past decade — from “Interstellar” and “Oblivion” to “Game of Thrones” and “Thor” — have used its peerless primordial terrain to represent alternate dimensions and far-off planets. Iceland plays itself in Robert Eggers’ “The Northman,” a brutal tale of 10th-century Viking revenge that makes evocative use of far more than just the scenery to be found in this stunning Nordic outpost. Teaming with local novelist Sjón, Eggers — a visionary director with a preternatural interest in history, as evidenced by his rigorously detail-oriented horror movies “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” — also draws from the region’s rich folklore, looking to the sagas of Iceland, as well as the same Scandinavian legend that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” to mount the classiest Vikesploitation epic you can imagine, complete with a doomsday Björk cameo. That it’s ultimately rather dull and hardly any fun is almost beside the point. Blame that largely on Alexander Skarsgård, son of towering European talent Stellan (“Breaking the Waves”). Alexander’s as handsome a star as Sweden has produced, but sorely lacks the charisma to carry a movie of this scale — rumored to have cost $90 million. Though he’s bulked up significantly since his comparably physical turn in 2016’s largely unnecessary “The Legend of Tarzan,” muscles only go so far to compensate for the strange emptiness behind young Skarsgård’s eyes. And so, this scion of art-house royalty has much to prove in a starring role that borrows heavily from “Gladiator” and pretty much every Mel Gibson movie (but mostly “Braveheart”). The story is simple — too simple, alas: Puny prince Amleth (played as a boy by Oscar Novak) eagerly welcomes his father, Viking king Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), back from battle, undergoing an initiation ceremony that will set him on course to rule the tribe one day. “You are dogs who wish to become men,” growls the fool (Willem Dafoe), though Amleth’s animal instincts will not reveal themselves until much later. Upon exiting the trippy ritual, father and son are confronted by half-brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who relieves the king of his crown, and the head to which it is attached, then orders the same fate for his son, who escapes, repeating the words, “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” This mantra is practically all the plot “The Northman” offers, skipping forward across the years that many would find most compelling — when this tender child acquires the skills of strength and mind that make him capable of facing off against his uncle, who has taken Amleth’s mother, Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, blazing with unrivaled fury), as his queen. In most respects, Eggers is a unique artist with strong, singular ideas of how to script, stage and pace his films, and while “The Northman” is nothing if not a signature addition to a most original oeuvre — no one but Eggers would or could have reimagined “Hamlet” thus — it lacks the element of surprise that made “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” feel like instant classics. Over the course of a portentous 137 minutes, Amleth will dutifully avenge his father, “save” his mother and face off against Fjölnir, but none of it makes even a fraction of the emotional impact we’d expect from even the crassest sword-and-sandal movie. Eggers’ films tend to play on a different, more self-conscious level, where audiences’ pleasure comes as much from atmosphere and all-around weirdness as it does from deranged narratives that, in retrospect, are destined to have played out exactly as they did. If anything, the oddity factor should be greater here than ever, given Eggers’ fetishistic commitment to weaving elements of Norse mythology alongside the punishing Icelandic action. To that end, visions of screaming Valkyries (model Ineta Sliuzaite) and a haggard He-Witch (Ingvar Sigurðsson) pack a hallucinatory punch amid the otherworldly locales. Still, “The Northman” feels unusually thin, with less meat on its bones than 2007’s schlocky “Pathfinder” or your basic “Conan” movie. Eggers, who formerly let his freak flag fly with A24, has reverted to a more conventional mode for this relatively mainstream Focus Features release, eschewing the elevated language of “The Lighthouse” and avoiding the kind of surrealism seen in David Lowery’s “The Green Knight” last year — a film that should have paved the way for far greater expressionism here. The movie that “The Northman” most resembles is “The Revenant,” an impressively orchestrated marathon of misery that prioritized directorial skill over audience engagement. Eggers’ feat seems similarly monomaniacal in its mission, often at the expense of the human dimension. After raiding a Slavic village in a spectacular early scene, filmed in what appears to be a single uninterrupted take, Amleth hears the prediction that will snap him out of berserker mode and set him in motion to fulfill his destiny. His rather implausible plan involves branding his chest and sailing to Iceland with a boat full of Slavic slaves, including an almond-eyed beauty with platinum hair named Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). Olga proves to be both an asset and a distraction to Amleth upon reaching Iceland, suggesting a path his life could take if he were to set aside his fixation on revenge in favor of romance, Óðinn willing. This alternative is made explicit in a scene that seems all wrong for the movie, set aboard a Viking longship, as the actors stand crudely haloed against CG backdrops, suggesting either reshoots (this is only a guess, though it would explain what doesn’t work about the last act of the film) or a grave miscalculation as to what motivates the final, fiery showdown between Amleth and Fjölnir. There’s a tried-and-true formula for revenge movies, which are tragic by their very nature, that depends on repeated demonstrations of evil by a figure who deserves to be destroyed. That model would require Fjölnir to do something unforgivable to Olga, since she’s the only thing in the world Amleth cares about. Failing that, he comes across as a cruel and merciless protagonist, bent on crushing the life of a man whom fate has already humbled. We still want to see him succeed, battling it out in the buff against the flaming Gates of Hel, but by this point, a film that has shown such painstaking attention to craft over character seems to be running more on testosterone than sensitivity."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," It’s a tale as old as Shakespeare (and, in fact, adapts more directly the Norse legend on which Hamlet was based): In 892 AD, a young Viking prince named Amleth sees his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), return wounded from an expedition, only for his bastard brother Fjölnir (Dracula‘s Claes Bang) to strike him down and stage a violent coup. Their village running red with blood, Amleth escapes certain death only to see Fjölnir taking Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) for himself; Amleth flees, revenge on his lips. Years later, he’s grown into a mighty beast of a Viking (Alexander Skarsgård), mindlessly raping and raiding and pillaging while searching for his chance for revenge. And when a mysterious seer (Björk) prophesies the end of his journey (and its destination in Iceland), he stows away on a slave ship to finally slay his father’s killer — with the aid of Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic witch and fellow slave who’s drawn to his quest. But when he finally arrives at Fjölnir’s new digs, posing as an anonymous slave, his thirst for blood grows ever more complicated by the presence of the supernatural and the amorality of his deed. That’s All, Folklore: It could be argued that Robert Eggers is one of the architects of our modern horror lexicon: With his staggering debut The Witch (which also starred Taylor-Joy), and later The Lighthouse, Eggers molded a bleak, Expressionistic aesthetic that’s basically become the house style for A24’s horror output. With The Northman, though, Eggers moves to Focus Features and makes (for him, at least), his most accessible movie yet: a blood-soaked action-horror picture that feels like The Green Knight meets Conan the Barbarian. Like his previous two, Eggers’ latest is another immersive exercise in historical folklore, The Northman steeped in the thumping, chest-beating mores of Norse myth and manhood. The script, by Eggers and frequent Björk collaborator Sjón, is filled with high-minded, stylized dialogue that evokes Shakespearean scope while keeping the audience enticingly at arm’s length. There’s talk of Valholl (Valhalla), the god Freyr, the myths of the Fenrir; all are stories that give our characters solace, ambition, hope in the face of darkness. Amleth himself is bound and shaped by the myth of the wolf, first taught to him by Aurvandill in strange, hallucinogenic rituals (with the aid of Willem Dafoe’s jester-turned-wizard), then reinforced by his Viking band of berserkers who howl at the moon and wear wolf pelts atop their heads. Amleth endures dreamlike staredowns with desiccated skulls, fights spiritual battles with demons for command of his fated sword (fittingly called the Death Blade), and sees visions of his lineage as fruit dangling from the branches of the Tree of Life. The cast takes to this lyricism nicely, especially Skarsgård, who’s tried the shirtless, brutish action her thing before (hello, The Legend of Tarzan), but gets far more layers to play here. With hunched shoulders and every breath seething smoke, his Amleth lies somewhere between man and creature, constantly negotiating between the boy he once was and the monster he had to become to survive (and train for this moment)."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," The Northman is written and directed by Robert Eggers, with Sjón serving as co-writer on the film. Additionally, it features a phenomenally powerful cast of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Gustav Lindh, Ethan Hawke, Björk, and Willem Dafoe. With a runtime of just over two hours, Eggers packs tension, action, fantasy, and mythology all into one package that never slows down. An action-filled epic with extraordinary single-shot action takes, The Northman follows a young Viking prince Amleth on his quest to avenge his father’s murder, save his mother, and kill the man who brought ruin to his life and fate. Embracing a more traditional narrative than we’ve seen before from the writer-director, revenge runs hot through the film. Whether it’s a primal feeling of intense violence or a stark cold river of hate flowing through him, Eggers explores the many facets of revenge. In one film with one family, Eggers explores how memories that fuel revenge may not be the unshaken truth we believe them to be and how revenge begets tragedy, regardless of its path. While action is an excellent way to describe elements of The Northman, brutality is a better word. We all know the violent nature of Viking customs both for religious ritual and justice, and Eggers weaves that violence into the film beautifully. The artistic brutality of The Northman is one of its most considerable strengths. The violence sets the stakes and tension and never allows you to feel that Amleth is safe. Truthfully, Eggers understands action sequences in a way most American directors do not. Violence and fighting aren’t devoid of narrative. In fact, they upend it, reinforce it, and add emotional weight. From the first fight to the last one we see, our “hero” is palpably pushed by rage and pain, which are never second-place to the swinging swords and feral attacks. Beyond that, though, the visualization of drug-induced moments throughout the film is visceral and uncomfortable in the best ways. And their shocking elements never feel out of place in the narrative. Even the use of animal death throughout the film made me squirm, but it never felt out of place. Instead, Eggers does what he always does: transports his audience to another time, another culture, and in a way, another world detached from the one we know. Finally, there isn’t a single actor who isn’t giving it their all. It’s hard to find better words to explain the performances in The Northman other than that every single actor is dialed into the same wavelength. The intensity and commitment given to every line, every scowl, and the small acts of tenderness by each actor makes for an entertaining film. Skarsgård is feral and driven, Kidman is cunning, Taylor-Joy threads the needle between whimsical and fierce, Hawke is unrelenting, Bang is charismatic and endearing, and Dafoe a certain kind of wise chaos. While none have more time than Skarsgård, all of them give unforgettable performances. A true ensemble with bite. The bite and intensity are bolstered by a phenomenal set design, transformative landscapes, and costuming that shows a keen eye for detail. Everything in the film sings together, elevating each part further. The Northman was made for me. It’s a feast of visuals and balanced storytelling. It considers Norse storytelling and history that shows Egger’s prowess as both a director and a writer. Additionally, the film itself has more wide appeal than his past two in that it offers up more action, less downtime, and a familiar use of revenge. That said, its accessibility to audiences who aren’t particularly open to more arthouse films doesn’t harm Egger’s auteur and experimental style. Instead, it’s a bridge between genre filmmaking that gets experimental and a story and aesthetic that wide audiences like. In truth, The Northman is a film I can recommend to anyone with a love for Vikings, revenge stories, action, fantasy, and the actors on the screen too. It’s violent and beautiful, cutting away at traditional narrative and throwing the audience into Viking storytelling and culture. Not to mention, it’s amazing to finally see Skarsgård in a role that pushes past genre actor who is there brood and look gorgeous. If there is any film that solidifies Skarsgård’s talent and drive, it’s The Northman.  The Northman is a film I can recommend to anyone with a love for Vikings, revenge stories, action, fantasy, and the actors on the screen. It’s violent and beautiful, cutting away at traditional narrative and throwing the audience into Viking storytelling and culture. Kate Sánchez is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of But Why Tho?

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," About as subtle as a Norse raid, Robert Eggers’ take-no-prisoners assault on Scandinavian legend could prove a ‘Peak Viking’ water mark in the audio-visual industry’s ongoing obsession with six-packed pillaging Norsemen. Owing more to the rangy hysteria of the American writer-director’s The Lighthouse (2019) than the restrained fear of The Witch (2015), Eggers’ opus goes full-out gonzo in a story billed as the template for Shakespeare’s Hamlet but familiar as an elemental legend with wide-ranging roots in common folklore. Adorned with occult trappings, shot insanely in a way that befits a piece about madness, The Northman is essentially the boilerplate story of a young prince who comes back to avenge his father, murdered at the hands of his own brother. Eggers and Icelandic co-writer Sjon add significant Scandinavian topsail and obsessive attention to detail on that yarn across 138 minutes, but even Bjork’s supernatural seer can’t stave off the numbing effects of such extreme violence. Gore-soaked - dripping with it, in fact - The Northman is coy when it comes to sex (pillagers always wear their pants, at least for full-frontals) to obtain its R rating. The appeal will lie, then, with audiences who feel TV’s Vikings aren’t quite vicious enough, Eggers fans, and the cinematically curious, who will come away dazed, and sometimes dazzled. Ethan Hawke, as the soon-to-be-murdered Danish scion Aurvandil, Nicole Kidman, as his wife Gudrun, Claes Bang as the usurper Fjolnir and Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga, a young slave, support Alexander Skarsgard, who produced, in the titular role. He is Amleth, first seen as a child on his father’s return from battle in opening scenes reminiscent of John Boorman’s Excalibur, although it soon becomes clear that very many scenes are familiar here and it is Eggers’ signature on them that will count in the end. Such as, for example, a kingly initiation ceremony - but one in which father and son, howling like dogs, lap up some psychedelic drugs and, amongst other things, see a tree on which a puppet version of the royal family is hanging. Such ‘tender’ moments are quickly over, though, when Aurvandil is stabbed and decapitated by Fjolnir. Amleth sails away, eventually joining some all-out berserker Viking raiders in wolf skins who jog around a fire half-naked before going rabid, howling and chewing at their victims in the ‘Land of Rus’. Amleth - for it is he under the wolf head! - is vicious and desensitised through his trauma and, also, now equipped with a cans-of-Carlsberg-firm six pack. Bjork enters the fray with a prophecy; Amleth discovers Fjolnir has lost the crown and fled to Iceland with his mother, and all bets are off as he gets himself captured as a slave and snakes into their lives (with Olga in tow) to wreak revenge. The legend of Amleth is said to be derived from the Roman story of Brutus, but parts of it have floated around the ether and come back in various guises. Eggers, securing himself in Iceland with Sjon’s assistance, picks and chooses from Amleth’s story too. Why take the crew to Iceland if you can’t feature a volcano at a key moment - or a chaste sex scene in a hot spring? Parts of The Northman are intensely impressive. Returning DoP Jarin Blaschke sets his stall early with close-up tracking shots of Aurvandil’s return - the intimacy and perspective as the King enters the castle gates gives the film a precipitous feel, as if this meticulously realised world is tilting. Then it glides back down again. This tight approach also works well in scenes of mayhem and madness - on a village raid, or in a storm at sea, where editor Louise Ford stitches coherence into the bloody frenzy. There are other times, though, where the film falls apart under the weight of Eggers’ more-is-never-enough approach. Too many shots, too many cuts, too much growly bass on the soundtrack, too many distractions fiddling between black-and-white and colour and tinting, too blunt a narrative and characterisation to sustain the running time. And that is long before the hurling/hockey match that ends in a storm of nose-crunching head-nutting, or Olga putting mushrooms in everyone’s soup and Kidman in full Lady Macbeth mode careening out of a wardrobe in a blood lust (one of the film’s best scenes). The Northman ends up in the so-called ‘Gates of Hell’ for a sequence which takes itself incredibly seriously yet brings to mind memories of Harry Hamlin in Clash Of The Titans — precisely not what Eggers is aiming for. Perhaps that is a hysterical reaction to being bashed and battered in blood for the previous two hours, or a response to the stream of plot elongations that have brought the film to this point (Amleth passes on multiple opportunities to slay Fjolnir in several contrivances.) The Northman is often bloody smart entertainment, although, essentially, it is also the good time that doesn’t realise that the fun has stopped.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," With “The Northman,” we encounter the brilliant execution of a fairly demented vision. To see it is to think, simultaneously, “Wow” and “What were they thinking?!” This puts “The Northman” into a peculiar category of good movie. After all, when you consider how many pictures get made each year, and how many have been made since Thomas Edison and the Lumiere brothers, if a movie makes you say, “Well, I’ve never seen that before,” it’s halfway there. Co-written by Robert Eggers (“The Lighthouse”) and Sjón (“Lamb”), “The Northman” is based on the same legend that produced Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” though the bloodbath that ends “Hamlet” would be considered a light sprinkling here. This movie presents a world of utter brutality. It begins with a large black raven flying into the center of the frame and then darting off, as the camera moves faster and faster toward a land mass, which reveals itself to be ninth century Iceland. If someone ever builds a time machine, don’t expect ninth century Iceland to be getting many requests. The King (Ethan Hawke) returns from a recent war with his abdomen tightly bound in cloth, because he has been slashed and his wound is still oozing blood. For him, it’s just another day at the office. He tells his wife (played by Nicole Kidman) that he is too unwell for sex, but he does find the energy for some special bonding with his teenage son. They visit a shaman and spend a fun afternoon crawling around, wearing paint and learning how to grunt like wild animals. In “Hamlet,” it took a ghost to inform the title character that his uncle had killed his father. Here, young Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnesses the murder and has to flee Iceland by sea. In exile, he develops into a strapping fellow (Alexander Skarsgård), who is not big on self-reflection. It’s only when he and a band of like-minded marauders lay waste to a settlement that it occurs to him that maybe now would be a good time to go back to Iceland to take revenge on his uncle. Basically, he reaches a point in life where he realizes that killing 20 people a day is no longer spiritually satisfying. From this point on, he needs to kill the right 20 people. Two-thirds into the movie, it would be fair to say that “The Northman” takes on a certain sameness, what with all the broadswords and slaughter. But what doesn’t get old is the sense of seeing something genuinely alien. Eggers puts the dark back in the Dark Ages. He depicts a world that’s not only un-survivable, but unlivable, where everything is nonstop awful, including the cuisine. The movie also never stops being interesting to look at, with its mixes of black and white and color. For almost half of the movie, you might wonder why Nicole Kidman chose to take such a lackluster role. The answer: Just wait — and brace yourself. Kidman is never happier than when she gets to go to extremes, and by that measure, Queen Gudrun is one of her happiest roles. Anya Taylor-Joy shows up as a Slavic slave, thick accent and all. Taylor-Joy is unable to conceal her 21st century consciousness as she looks at all around her with huge eyes and a blank expression that seems to say, “What a dump.” M“The Northman”: Action. Starring Alexander Skarsgård, Anya Taylor-Joy, Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke. Directed by Robert Eggers. (R. 140 minutes.) In Bay Area theaters starting Friday, April 22."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’ follow-up to The Witch and The Lighthouse comes with a certain level of expectation. Since it was first screened, critics have raved about The Northman as Eggers’ best and biggest film yet, marrying epic visuals with the filmmaker’s trademark offbeat diversions. In some ways they’re right – The Northman looks incredible and features some challenging moments and top-notch performances from its cast. But the film also suffers slightly as director/co-writer Eggers steps up into more mainstream, accessible cinema, with Eggers’ trademark flights of imagination and horror sitting uneasily against the film’s more traditional revenge plot. Said plot is, of course, familiar to anyone who’s seen Hamlet (or, more appropriately given Claes Bang’s shaggy mane of hair in this film, The Lion King). Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) flees his home when his father the King (Ethan Hawke) is murdered by his brother (Bang), and his mother (Nicole Kidman) is captured and forced into marriage. Years later, shaped into a killing machine by years of Viking raids, Amleth is ready to take his vengeance – with the help of some implied supernatural forces and Slavic slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy). Over the course of the film, we see Amleth gradually chip away at his uncle’s life, all leading to an epic clash where both men battle amidst the lava of a volcano. It’s bloody, pagan, bleak (thanks to the Icelandic setting) and vicious. I’ve never seen a film that quite looks like this – it’s a feast for the senses, and gently explores superstition, faith and loss in interesting ways. I particularly enjoyed its light-touch approach to superstition and deific intervention, which are left teasingly ambiguous right until the end. It’s a shame that other parts of the film are less exploratory. This chapter from the Icelandic sagas has endured so many different adaptations and reinterpretations (including Shakespeare’s) for a reason – it’s an automatically engaging tale, easily understood. And while Eggers pushes the envelope technically and visually with the film, he doesn’t do much to update or advance this age-old plot, delivering story beats that are less profound or mysterious than you might have hoped for. Reportedly, early tests for the first cut of The Northman led to the studio demanding a more accessible edit, and I’d love to see what that first version of the film was like. This version feels like it has two identities – one a straight gritty period action movie (which is what it seems to be marketed as) and one that’s more recognisably Eggers, full of unsettling sequences and characters challenging the natural order. The Lighthouse-like weirdness largely feels fenced off, contained in certain areas for Amleth to visit but not spend too long with. I wanted more of it! And it makes the finished film fall between two stools – too weird and unsettling for a mainstream audience, too straightforward and uninspired for Eggers’ usual fans. I’m not quite sure who this film is for, and I’m not sure that Universal does either. Don’t get me wrong – this is still a great piece of filmmaking that’s heads and shoulders above whatever pictures it’ll rub shoulders with at the box office. It has a genuine aesthetic style, moments of real invention and a few moments that’ll make any cinema audience gasp or cry out (personally, I’m so glad that I saw this film with a big crowd thanks to one Nicole Kidman scene in particular). But in the end, if you were expecting Robert Eggers to say something interesting or profound about vengeance or the toxic masculinity of warrior culture, you’ll have to look elsewhere.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," It’s been a while since we’ve had an all-out blood-and-guts battle orgy in which warriors outfitted in sackcloth and animal skins hurl themselves into the fray, wielding swords and blazing torches, shields, hatchets and daggers, while bellowing dialogue that mostly begins and ends with “RAAARRRGGGHHH!” There’s a lot of that in The Northman, a brawny fever dream which makes the freaky artisanal horror that put director Robert Eggers on the map — The Witch and The Lighthouse — look like Disney movies. To use a term from a ritualistic fireside chant where Alexander Skarsgård’s Amleth blurs the line between man and beast, this is the untamed “berserker” of Norse legends. Navigating the leap from his modestly budgeted previous instant-cult films to this large-scale $90 million bloodbath for Focus Features, Eggers is nothing if not fearless. Benefitting again from the exactingly detailed work of production designer Craig Lathrop and costumer Linda Muir, the director conjures an immersive, pungently evocative atmosphere that catapults us back to the turn of the 10th century, a dark and viscerally violent past in which human savagery and the supernatural co-exist. The inadvertently campy dialogue in the script Eggers co-wrote with Icelandic novelist and poet Sjón (Lamb) quite often prompts giggles, and the Scandinavian accents coming out of the mouths of actors like Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy and Ethan Hawke risk bringing on a House of Gucci trauma relapse. It’s an audaciously bonkers movie that keeps threatening to careen off into some kind of weird no man’s land where Game of Thrones meets Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And that’s even before Björk drops by as a witchy seeress, outfitted in wicker work, seashells and beads. But The Northman’s marauding energy holds you hostage and Prince Amleth is the hunky, heroically vengeful killing machine with a heart that Skarsgård was born to play. Longtime fans will get a kick out of him tapping into the cultural roots of his ancient True Blood vampire, Eric Northman, too. The screenplay draws from both Norse myths and Icelandic family sagas, building on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The prologue takes place in the fictitious North Atlantic island kingdom of Hrafnsey, where King Aurvandil (Hawke), aka War-Raven, arrives home to much fanfare. The gash in his guts inflicted by a foe in battle prompts him to prepare the 10-year-old Amleth (Oscar Novak) to take over the throne, despite the objections of Queen Gudrún (Kidman) that their son is just a boy. Amleth’s transcendental initiation involves crawling around on all fours underground with his father, howling like wolves. Also, belching, farting, levitating and accessing disturbing visions via Aurvandil’s wound. No sooner has Amleth sworn to avenge his father should he die by an enemy’s sword than the boy witnesses his murder at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), whose friskiness with the Queen has already been joked about by the shamanistic court fool, Heimir (Willem Dafoe). “Bring me the boy’s head,” Fjölnir commands his men, accompanied by the shrieking strings and pounding drums of Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s hard-driving score. But Amleth, after watching the slaughter of male villagers, abduction of the women and the Queen slung over Fjölnir’s shoulder and hauled off screaming, escapes by boat. He vows to rescue his mother, kill his uncle and avenge his father. A couple decades later, Amleth has transformed into a muscle-bound man harnessing the spirit of both a wolf and a bear. He’s rage personified, traveling the Land of the Rus with a pack of Viking raiders that seemingly never met a Slavic settlement they couldn’t plunder. But Björk’s earth-mother seeress recognizes him as the lost prince and reminds him of his fate. Learning that Fjölnir was driven from the kingdom he usurped and fled to a remote agrarian community in Iceland, Amleth boards a slave ship headed there to supply labor. Anya Taylor-Joy plays a fellow passenger who knows a good hook-up when she sees one. “I am Olga of the Birch Forest,” she says by way of introduction, adding that while he has the strength to break men’s bones, she has the cunning to break their minds. Both get taken on at Fjölnir’s farm, where Olga gradually gains Amleth’s trust and he reveals his plan to murder his uncle and save his mother, whom he believes is only feigning love for her abductor for the sake of their young son (Elliott Rose). Eggers’ films have shared a fascination with the magical properties of animals — a goat in The Witch (love you, Black Phillip), a cursed seagull in The Lighthouse. The occult fauna this time is wolf cubs and ravens, the former leading Amleth to find a massive sword of the undead, known as The Night Blade; the latter getting busy with their beaks when he’s tortured and bound late in the game. The storytelling accelerates as Amleth gets closer to his goal, wreaking carnage among his uncle’s men and sparking fear of a “distempered spirit” in their midst. The plotting becomes more frenetic though remains lucid, even if there are one or two arch moments that had me almost howling like a wolf. Gudrún’s reunion with the son she long believed to be dead should have been a moment of high drama. But it’s hard not to laugh when Kidman, wearing Daryl Hannah’s old crimped hair from Splash and sporting a Natasha Fatale accent, greets a mighty silver blade at her throat with, “Your sword is long,” before engaging in some incestuous flirtation. When Fjölnir suffers a grievous loss and screams, “What evil is this?!” Gudrún shoots him a wide-eyed death stare and snaps, “Behave!” like she’s a Nordic Austin Powers. The romance between Amleth and Olga also has time to blossom during all this, complete with a post-coital respite in the woods right out of John Boorman’s Excalibur. There’s also an interlude on a flying horse ridden by a fiery-eyed Valkyrie (Ineta Sliuzaite). But even as Amleth ensures the continuation of his bloodline, his deathly appointment with uncle Fjölnir at “the gates of hell” remains. That would be the mouth of an active volcano, where they fight nude, as any self-respecting medieval warrior would, though their digitally erased penises make them look distractingly like Ken dolls. I could be wrong, but their smooth groins in the lava light look more like the result of studio interference than prudishness on the part of the actors or of a director so intent on presenting a world suspended between life and legend in all its gritty glory. The film is shot by Eggers’ regular DP Jarin Blaschke, with restless propulsion and with a textured feel for the dramatic landscapes, lashed by rain, wind, snow and ice, or coated with mud and ash. The choreography of the combat scenes — both the staging and the shooting, in long, unbroken takes — is mind-blowing. Also fully enveloping is the dense sound design, with Viking Age instruments like the birch horn and bone flute heard alongside the thundering elements and the chaos of fighting. The Northman is certainly a lot of movie, and while its hysterical intensity at times veers into overwrought silliness, it’s both unstinting and exhilarating in its depiction of a culture ruled by the cycles of violence. The cohesion of Eggers’ vision commands admiration, as does the commitment of his collaborators, both in front of and behind the camera. Skarsgård, who has been working for more than a decade to develop a film project rooted in his childhood love of Viking myth and lore, has never been fiercer or more physically imposing. Taylor-Joy, who got her start in The Witch, is beguiling as Olga weaves baskets and plots havoc. (Her parents from that earlier film, Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson, also make appearances.) Kidman is a hoot, juggling fire and ice in an enjoyably over-the-top turn. And if someone doesn’t cast Bang as a Bond nemesis or some other suitably elevated evildoer soon, then Hollywood just isn’t paying attention. Whether you buy into Eggers’ insane epic, get high on its blood-drenched sorcery or roll your eyes at its excesses, the film makes you appreciate how seldom we get to see a big, noisy, brawling spectacle these days that’s grounded not in comic-book superheroes and villains but in culturally specific history. In other words, a work of bold imagination, not another offshoot of a familiar IP. That alone deserves respect."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE,Uncompromisingly grim and savage.
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," History comes thundering back to life in The Northman, in a chorus of howls, farts, and belches. This is a Viking epic of thick, blood-red brutality, where Alexander Skarsgård – so bulked up he can only stand wide-legged like a He-Man action figure – rips a man’s throat out with his bare teeth. Where Ethan Hawke, high off the fumes of ancient henbane seeds, crawls feverishly around a mossy cave while a dust-caked and cackling Willem Dafoe decries the “dogs that want to become men”. Where Nicole Kidman, coins shimmering around her furrowed brow, delivers a performance so feral it seems to shake the very foundations of the frame she inhabits. Robert Eggers, a director who might be better termed a mythmaker, has stretched his ambitions beyond the claustrophobia of his New England folktales, The Witch (2015) and The Lighthouse (2019). The Northman – set in the craggy expanses of Iceland’s fjords – is its own, complete saga, a loose adaptation of the story that once inspired Shakespeare to write his Hamlet. As a child, Prince Amleth (Skarsgård) saw his father (Hawke) killed by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who then claimed as his own both the throne and its queen – Amleth’s mother Gudrún (Kidman). Eggers, co-writing the script with Icelandic poet Sjón (a friend of Björk, who makes a thrillingly on-brand cameo here as a wool-weaving Seeress), sets his story in 914, before Iceland began to form its sense of national identity. The Northman is a film of hard-bitten masculinity, about a time in history when “bros being bros” meant fighting to the death at the foot of an erupting volcano. There’s an extended tracking shot in this film, which follows a berserker raid on a village, that might very well snatch your soul out of your body – where physical prowess is rewarded with nothing but the shuffling of chained captives, burning bodies, and the starved, vacant eyes of Skarsgård’s Amleth. The actor’s work in The Northman isn’t burdened by the egotistical theatrics that usually come with “transformative” performances – it’s the pinnacle of a career founded on well-crafted but unshowy turns, usually as men who are very bad news. There’s no glory to be found here for Amleth or his fellow warriors, with the film directly resisting the weaponisation of Viking imagery by white nationalist movements. Throughout his film, Eggers maintains a commitment to authenticity over populist perception. The director never shrugs off the vicious misogyny of the period, either, carving out a special place for the women of his film and the deep, feminine nature of Viking sorcery. On his journey, Almeth crosses paths with a Slavic slave, Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy). Minutes into their meeting, she slyly informs him: “You have the strength to break men’s bones, but I have the courage to break their minds.” The Northman’s authenticity isn’t limited solely to its aesthetic details, though the sets and costumes crafted by Eggers regulars Craig Lathrop and Linda Muir put any of the film’s contemporaries to shame (yes, even Gladiator… especially Gladiator). There are exquisite wood carvings, braids and buckles, and an appearance by a shield-maiden that nods directly to recent DNA evidence that female warriors weren’t confined to the Viking imagination. The film is also fundamentally rooted in pagan beliefs, without sacrificing the modern demands of the action genre – the whole thing still barrels along like Almeth’s headed towards a final standoff with John Wick. Our hero, as it’s uttered in the film’s prologue, is a “prince destined for valour”. Yet, The Northman doesn’t abide by a triumphant “chosen one” narrative, but by the far more Viking-appropriate and grimly stoic acceptance that one’s fate has already been woven by the Norns, the wise women who shape the fates of all beings. Eggers’s films have all been set in eras and places where the divide between the natural and supernatural feels as thin as a wisp, but The Northman allows him to push his flair for folkloric images to a new extreme. He shows us a tree hung with the zombified corpses of long-dead ancestors, and a valkyrie riding her way to the hero’s paradise of Valhǫll. The film’s budget, partially due to pandemic delays, reached somewhere around $90m (£69m). It’s a big risk to spend that much cash on an auteur-driven historical epic at a time when historical epics have largely fallen by the wayside. But what a beautiful risk it is. I call upon Odin: may The Northman make a billion dollars."

All you really need to know about “The Northman” — a $90 million Viking revenge saga directed by Robert Eggers — is that every single minute of it feels like a $90 million Viking revenge saga directed by Robert Eggers. Both parts of that equation are worth celebrating outside of and in addition to the movie’s other merits. Even if “The Northman” had been a dreadful bore — and not a primal, sinewy, gnarly-as-fuck 10th century action epic that starts with a hallucinogenic Viking bar mitzvah, features Björk’s first narrative film performance since “Dancer in the Dark,” and ends with two mostly naked men fighting to the death atop an erupting volcano — the simple fact that financiers had the chutzpah to bankroll such a big swing in the face of our blockbuster-or-bust theatrical climate would have felt like a (pyrrhic) victory against the forces of corporate homogenization, no matter who was behind the camera. That “The Northman” was entrusted to a fetishistically uncompromising young auteur whose previous movie was a single-location sea shanty best-remembered for mermaid vaginas and Willem Dafoe asking, “Why’d you spill your beans!?” makes it even riskier to slot into multiplexes between “Sonic 2” and “MCU 28.” That the finished product viscerally feels like the work of the same artist — despite well-documented attempts to water it down — makes it something of a miracle. And yet, in an environment so neutered by empty spectacle that critics have been conditioned to do Cirque du Soleil-level backflips for anything even slightly less than obvious — an environment in which mild surprises are treated like government secrets, and the shock of the new is such a rare event that we tend to relay it with the breathlessness of a UFO sighting — it’s important to note that “The Northman” isn’t satisfying just because it’s fun to see Eggers’ fingerprints smudged into every frame of such a big movie. It’s also (and more rewardingly) satisfying because the director’s signature handicraft allows “The Northman” to dismantle its modern context and retell a Viking legend with such raw immediacy that its fjords of blood seem freshly spilled for the first time in 1,000 years. “The Northman” may fall short of being Eggers’ best film (its terse savagery doesn’t leave room for the emotional layering that allowed “The Witch” to burn so dark), but it’s undoubtedly the peak of his continuing effort to return some integrity to the past; to level the playing field between now and then by shooting period folklore with such historic fidelity that we experience it in the present tense. Just as “The Witch” is so unsettling because it renders sin with a Puritan sense of mortal danger, and “The Lighthouse” so febrile because it embodies the isolation of 19th century life on the fringes of sanity, “The Northman” is so grab-you-by-the-throat intense because it renders a Viking prince’s quest for vengeance as though fate were a force as real as the weather. And that’s exactly how it might have seemed to a Norse warrior in the North Atlantic circa 915 A.D. His priorities displace our own; his moral urgency overpowers whatever “civilized” moral code we try to force onto this ancient story. If “Hamlet” is often reductively (and destructively) summed up as a tragedy about someone who can’t make up their mind, “The Northman” — which is based on the violent legend that inspired Shakespeare’s play — is about someone who never really had a choice. All things are equal for Prince Amleth (initially seen as a 10-year-old boy played by Oscar Novak), who was born into a world where Valhalla is a place as real as the stony castle where he waits for his father, King Aurvandill War-Raven (a regal yet shifty Ethan Hawke), to return from war. And when he does, Aurvandill decides that it’s time for his son to become a man — a process that involves drinking spiked mead, howling at the moon while Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe) dances around them in a frenzy, and then looking upon the ghosts of dead kings that are hanging from Amleth’s family tree. “The Northman” doesn’t slow down to explain why Aurvandill is already among them, since Eggers refuses to make exposition out of anything that his characters might already know, but we get our answer soon enough. The very next morning, in fact, as Amleth’s hot uncle Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang) makes good on his name by slaughtering Aurvandill and kidnapping the newly widowed Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman, finding all sorts of wonderfully florid notes in her role as a cunning damsel in distress). Fjölnir’s henchman assures him that Amleth — the rightful heir to the throne — has been drowned at sea, but that’s not entirely accurate. The truth is that Amleth has escaped, and, in the span of a single cut that spans 20 years, will grow up to be a homicidal berserker the size of a small house, “a beast cloaked in manflesh,” who pillages Slavic villages with his pals in order to feed his insatiable appetite for death while he scours the earth for his uncle. Played by a hulking Alexander Skarsgård, whose human bulldozer of a performance channels the actor’s usual menace in a compellingly ambivalent new direction, adult Amleth is basically what would happen if Tarzan micro-dosed the T-virus from “Resident Evil” every day for two straight decades. A swollen husk of a man who’s literally hunched from the hatred he’s been carrying since he was a child (or maybe that’s just what happens to someone’s posture when their neck muscle looks like a boa constrictor trying to digest a whole poodle), the guy doesn’t even flinch when his buddies arrow down some local peasants for sport. At one point, he catches a javelin from mid-air with his bare hand and hurls it back at the sentry who threw it in one fluid motion; it’s the start of a raid that Eggers choreographs in a brutal yet harrowingly even-keeled long-take, one of several transportive sequence shots that lend physical weight to the inertia of Amleth’s destiny. And this is a character who moves forward on nothing but the wayward momentum of his own vengeance, which seems to have steered him off-course along the way. What he wants is clear — drink every time Amleth mutters “I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir” and you’ll be dead long before he can do any of those things — but the man is little more than a mantra. He doesn’t have any quips or heroic tendencies. He never smiles. The only truly relatable thing about Amleth is that he gets valuable life advice from Björk, who brings raspy perfection to her brief cameo as a magical seeress who shows up to remind the former prince of his path. His only soft spot is for a slave named Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy, going for a Gaga-like Transylvanian accent that benefits from being in a film of such extreme verisimilitude that even the most ridiculous choices feel right), who Amleth meets after learning that Fjölnir has absconded to Iceland, and deciding to disguise himself as one of his uncle’s newest purchases. And yet even the warmth that she inspires from him feels like a gnawing distraction from the task at hand. Kindness for his kin and hatred for his enemies might not be as mutually exclusive as those paths are first presented to Amleth, but little of the film’s tightly contained second half is spent hemming and hawing over what he will do next. On the contrary, “The Northman” only draws closer to the essence of Amleth’s fate as he ingratiates himself to Fjölnir by day and terrorizes his settlement by night, a cycle that’s segmented with chapter titles (e.g. “The Night Blade Feeds”) that reflect the morbid humor of a film that’s often funny but never in a winking sort of way. There are plenty of reasons to laugh during this movie, or at least shake your head in smiling disbelief at the extent of its brutality (brace for a new riff on a human centipede), but the “jokes” don’t foster a sense of ironic detachment so much as they chip away at it. For all of the talk about Eggers’ obsessive attention to historical detail, the right chain mail or piece of embroidery is ultimately in service to the form and perspective of a film that puts you in the mindset of someone who lived by some very different principles. Co-written by Eggers and the Icelandic poet Sjón, “The Northman” doesn’t appeal to modern notions of manliness or morality so much as it makes literal bloodsport of their limitations. Even when the foundations of Amleth’s quest are shaken at their deepest level, and it would seem to require a greater degree of strength to abandon his mission than to see it through, Eggers refuses to judge his protagonist. Amleth may be a dumb brute, but this movie finds an unalloyed kernel of beauty in the story of a warrior fulfilling their purpose. His story may have inspired one of Shakespeare’s most wounded tragedies, but “The Northman” can’t help but see a measure of ecstasy in a life of unyielding purpose. If anything, Amleth takes those words too close to heart, just as Eggers is so focused on the emotional fidelity of his Viking epic that he seems afraid of making any concessions to melodrama. He seems afraid of leaving any openings that a studio might have been able to exploit in order to manufacture a certain audience response. The one truly discomforting moment of vulnerability (you’ll know it when you see it) is an outlier in a film that’s often as clenched and withholding as its hero. “The Northman” doesn’t quite figure out a way to reconcile the merciless linearity of its story with the kind of flourishes that might allow it to register on a deeper level, as its confined setting and relatively limited scale (even on that $90 million budget) enforce a smallness that’s at odds with the sheer weight of its vision. But “The Northman” is never dull. The sheer muscularity of Eggers’ direction denies it that chance, as even the simplest scenes of Amleth glowering at his enemies or trudging through Fjölnir’s primordial farmland (Northern Ireland absolutely nailing its performance as Iceland) are bracingly rendered as steps on the road to Valhalla. Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s pounding score pumps the story full of blood like the heart of a whale, while Jarin Blaschke’s frostbitten cinematography allows the film to flatten mud-and-shit history into the stuff of “Elden Ring” high fantasy until they feel equally true, both for Amleth and for us. Also, someone gets decapitated like every 10 minutes. It’s not like this movie is a punishing chore; it’s not like Eggers doesn’t want multiplex audiences to like it. And they will. Because this is the kind of filmmaking that rips you out of your body so hard that you’re liable to forget what year it is. In a movie era that’s been defined by compromise, “The Northman” rides into theaters with the fury of a valkyrie — it’s the rare studio epic that would sooner die than submit to modern precepts of how it should be told. While so many people in the industry are scrambling to change their fates, Eggers reminds us just how awesome it can feel to conquer them.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," The Witch and The Lighthouse director Robert Eggers is many things. He’s a meticulous craftsman with an eye for striking compositions. He’s a bearded hipster in a Carhartt jacket. If Facebook commenters are to be believed, he’s an “elevated horror” bogeyman who represents everything that’s wrong with the genre today. But above all that, he’s a history nerd. Eggers is the type of person who reads medieval Icelandic literature for fun — which is exactly how his latest project, the bloody Viking revenge saga The Northman, came into being.  The film’s press notes describe it as a painstakingly researched deep dive into the Viking lifestyle and worldview, backed by archaeologists and historians. But the experience of watching it isn’t nearly so dry and lofty. The actual movie feels more like a heavy-metal music video, a testosterone-fueled melange of fire, blood, nudity, and screaming, fueled by hatred and hallucinatory shamanic rituals. As is always the case in Eggers’ films, the line between belief in the supernatural and actual supernatural events is open to individual interpretation. But the characters have no doubt that the dead walk in the shadows, men can be possessed by wolves, and Valkyries will come to escort them to Valhalla if they’re lucky enough to die in battle. This is a movie where a wizard casts a spell using pieces cut off of Willem Dafoe’s severed, dessicated head, and Björk appears with a crown of wheat and the fates of men spun between her fingers.  Alexander Skarsgård stars as Amleth, son of a warrior-monarch known as the Raven King (Ethan Hawke). In childhood, Amleth witnesses his father’s murder at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Cleas Bang), and dedicates his life to revenge. The Shakespearan parallels grow deeper when Fjölnir marries his brother’s wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), who turns out to be a better Lady Macbeth than anyone in the Scottish play. As an adult, Amleth discovers this by following rumors to Iceland, where Fjölnir and his men have reinvented themselves as sheep farmers after losing their stolen kingdom to mightier Norwegian marauders. There, Amleth disguises himself as a slave and embarks on a campaign of guerilla warfare with the help of Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy), a Slavic witch who is also enslaved on Fjölnir’s land. Amleth is also aided by ravens, which periodically appear and remind him of the injustice done to his family.  The violence that follows (and precedes) Amleth’s arrival in Iceland is gory and graphic, and Eggers films Viking raids on humble villages in impressively choreographed tracking shots that glide through the blood, mud, and gurgling death rattles of dozens of sackcloth-clad extras. The dialogue similarly blends savagery with bombast: One character chokes out a death curse, promising to plague his killer until “a flaming vengeance gorges on your flesh.” Another optimistically tells a friend, “together we will rage on the battlefield of corpses.” Place all this against the majestic Icelandic landscape and an aural backdrop of booming drums and deep bass chants that roll in like a thunderstorm, and the effect is appropriately awe-inspiring. Although the scene where Amleth bludgeons a man to death with his head is probably not historically necessary, the brutality on display throughout The Northman isn’t entirely gratuitous. Viking culture placed great emphasis on dominance through brute force: At one point, a character refers to becoming a “graybeard” — i.e., living long enough for your hair to turn white — as a shameful fate that’s worse than death. (For the women, this culture of subjugation manifests as the continual threat of sexual violence, which Eggers thankfully leaves mostly offscreen.) This contrasts with a more modern narrative thread, questioning whether Amleth’s revenge plot is ultimately a futile and misguided gesture.  Without going into too much detail, Amleth (and Eggers) ultimately decide to take the culturally accurate route. This neatly wraps up the narrative, but it points to a weakness in The Northman that makes it less resonant than Eggers’ debut film, The Witch. That film asked whether it was witchcraft or a society that believed in witchcraft that was to blame for the persecution of women like the protagonist, Thomasin (also played by Taylor-Joy). That thread is present here, too, although Eggers seems to be having more fun leading the wild hunt than pondering its implications. And ultimately, the more thoughtful themes in The Northman’s script are drowned out by the beating of feral drums, and washed away in a river of carnage, culminating in a grimy naked swordfight in a field of lava, as repeatedly promised by prophecy throughout the film. But although the film ends up as a shallow rumination on revenge and single-minded dominance, it’s hard to beat as spectacle. In terms of making history exciting and engrossing, The Northman is about as titillating as gateway drugs get. "
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," PLOT: After his father, the King (Ethan Hawke), is murdered by his brother (Claes Bang), a Viking prince named Amleth escapes his kingdom, vowing to return and take revenge. Years later, the now hulking Amleth (Alexander Skarsgard) discovers his murderous uncle lost his kingdom and is now a feudal lord. Amleth poses as a slave to take his revenge but must decide what to do about his mother (Nicole Kidman) and young half-brother. REVIEW: If The Northman‘s premise sounds a bit like Hamlet, that’s because the old Scandinavian legend of Amleth directly influenced William Shakespeare. Robert Eggers’ epic new film is an adaptation by him and Icelandic writer Sjón of the ancient tale. Indeed, it’s a classic tale of revenge that lends itself beautifully to what will no doubt be considered the definitive Viking movie, with Eggers brilliantly making a move into big-budget action. His artful but accessible film ranks among the best films I’ve seen in the last few years. It’s a stone-cold masterpiece. For many of us, Alexander Skarsgard’s Amleth should become his definitive role. It’s one of those unforgettable performances that seems bound to be iconic. Packing loads of muscle onto his already imposing frame, Skarsgard’s Amleth is a terrifying hero. While we meet the character as a boy, being ushered into the world of Vikings by his loving father, the King (a memorable role for Ethan Hawke – who’s cast against type), Skarsgard’s introduction is breathtaking. When we first meet him, it’s been years since he had to flee his homeland, and he’s become a Berserker warrior – part of a group of travelling Vikings that lay waste to villages, rob and pillage, and take slaves. There’s a brilliant setpiece where Eggers shoots a Berserker siege in a single, unbroken take that will be discussed for years to come. At the end of the siege, the Berserkers take slaves to barter. Among them is Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga, a sorceress, and the two begin to rely on one another once Amleth’s plan springs into action, with him branding himself a slave so he can be sold to his murderous uncle, played by Claes Bang. Eggers has crafted one of the most immersive historical films I’ve ever seen. Meticulously researched, it makes other Viking shows and movies look cartoonish by comparison. Apparently, Skarsgard himself has sought to make a Viking film for over a decade. You can tell that he and Eggers approached the material not just wanting to make a generic historical action movie. We get into the Viking mindset and beliefs, with some hallucinatory sequences peppered throughout, such as a trippy early one with Willem Dafoe’s Heimir, who’s the court fool and the keeper of Viking legends. Eggers has done a great job giving the film his personal stamp, as you don’t hire the director of The Witch and The Lighthouse unless you want a bold vision. But, he also doesn’t deny the audience plenty of action, with some incredible action setpieces, including the Berserker raid and a fantastic sequence where Amleth is forced to play a brutal Viking game that devolves into a show-stopping fight between him and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, better known as The Mountain from Game of Thrones. While this is Skargard’s movie through and through, with him virtually never offscreen following the prologue, the supporting cast is terrific, with Anya Taylor-Joy having a great part that’s somewhat reminiscent of her turn in The Witch. She’s a sorceress named Olga who, as she tells Amleth, can break men’s minds. Ultimately, like Amleth, she’s portrayed as a somewhat heroic character, as they remain loyal to each other and lack the cruelty of virtually everyone else in this world. As Amleth’s mother, Nicole Kidman initially seems like an odd piece of casting, but her chemistry with Skarsgard, leftover from Big Little Lies, benefits the second half of the film when her performance starts to truly take shape. Once she’s unleashed, Kidman is terrific. Claes Bang makes for a memorably complex villain. As cruel as he is to his slaves, some moments depict a genuine love for his family, and Bang, who towers at 6’4, really holds his own in the epic sword battle that closes the film. Plus, Bjork shows up in a memorable cameo as an eyeless seer. All in all, a perfectly assembled cast. Technically, the movie is impeccable as well. While Eggers favoured more unusual aspect ratios for The Lighthouse and The Witch, where he shoots the film in 2:1, giving true scope to Jarin Blaschke’s visuals. The movie is a visual and sonic feast, with incredible sound design and a score by Robin Carolan & Sebastian Gainsborough that MUST be remembered by the academy next year. It all adds up to a genuinely immersive Viking experience, with loads of action and violent carnage that should please everyone. The Northman delivers all of the action you want from a movie like this, but Eggers also elevates it by giving it a truly original, artistic bent. This is one of the best mixings of the arthouse and blockbuster genres that I’ve ever seen. Trust me when I tell you, The Northman is a masterpiece.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Whether the dread-inducing rituals of witches or a turpentine-fueled descent into hysteria, Robert Eggers’ cinema is of unflinching immersion. Trapped in the center of symmetrical frames and surrounded by immaculate production design, the only escape for his characters’ fury seems to be bounding off the screen onto the audience themselves. The effect oscillates between entrancing and grating, wearing one down until there’s no choice but to succumb to the mania and plunge into the madness. A considerable step up in scope, his third feature The Northman gratefully bears scant touches of a compromised vision, delivering a bloody, visceral Viking epic that utilizes a simple revenge template as the canvas to examine the contradictions of a hero’s journey. “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” These already-memed few sentences are all the synopsis one needs, setting up the story developed by star Alexander Skarsgård and producer Lars Knudsen and scripted by Eggers and Sjón, based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth. Eggers gives no consideration to steady acclimation, immediately dropping us into a fully realized Viking world circa A.D. 859, complete with ceremonies involving burping and farting to prove one’s humanness and a barbaric life haunted by death that could arrive at any corner. It’s a startling, perhaps rushed beginning that takes a beat to find its footing, but once this prologue concludes––featuring a young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) witnessing the murder of his father (Ethan Hawke) by his uncle and vowing a life of revenge––we jump years later to a hulking, deeply committed Skarsgard portraying the Prince. With a masterfully executed single tracking shot peering from the woods, then gliding across the water to introduce our hero on a Viking long boat, its rhythm clicks into gear and rarely lets up from there. Now a Viking berserker pillaging villages, Amleth has become a hollow shell of a human; Eggers accordingly gives the horrors in all their unflinching depravity.  From munching into flesh for a death knell to the remaining villagers corralled into a locked cabin and hearing their screams as it is set on fire, a bleak tone is set quite early. But unlike the aimlessness of a similarly dire revenge tale, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s The Revenant, and all its faux-Malickian philosophical overreach, The Northman stays studiously focused on the journey at hand and, in effect, has far more to say about the dark side of vengeance. As Amleth contends with what life means when rage has warped you into a beast fueled solely by revenge, the film sets itself apart from Viking epics that have come before it, many of which had little concern for the interiority of their characters. Eggers also, thankfully, has a bit of fun. Nicole Kidman more or less registers as a background character until she emerges with the best scene, turning the entire narrative on its head with a cheekily entertaining, scenery-chewing monologue. The film’s chapters, written in the runic alphabet of Elder Futhark, exhibit such titles as the grin-inducing, violence-portending “The Night Blade Feeds,” while Knattleikr, a Viking ball game of crushing savagery, offers a satisfying, bone-crunching mid-film diversion. Working on a far larger scale, cinematographer Jarin Blaschke captures the lush Nordic landscape in all its viridescent glory. There’s a strong use of negative space, whether it is Amleth teetering on the top of a barn in the corner of the frame or when he’s a speck in the vast wilderness. The charcoal-grey nighttime look gives a feeling of tones etched into mythic history. Dancing rituals around a nighttime campfire and forest orgies feature glimmers of lights in the far distance, giving mysterious depth to this world. While not approaching Hard to Be a God-levels of suffocating muck, battle scenes are engrossing in their one-take prowess. Never over-extended to the point of extraneous flaunting, they help guide this singularly-focused journey while providing both Skarsgard and Claes Bang (Fjölnir) an ample showcase for action-choreography chops. Fissures do present themselves—not least of all a recurring CG-heavy vision of a family tree that plays like unnecessary connect-the-dots material to appease a wider audience. While Björk and Willem Dafoe make an impression in their brief scenes, one wishes they were given more to play with. Anya Taylor-Joy––portraying Olga, a fellow slave with Amleth and a love interest along his winding journey––has more screentime than expected, but her character is rendered as little more than a spiritual sounding board for our lead. Yet it feels like a small phenomenon that Eggers was able to convey such a precise, graphic vision on this scale. With a strong sense of authenticity and purpose, The Northman is designed to unnerve and repel. In a wide release landscape of easy-to-please, vaporous entertainment, such feats should be celebrated."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers has created the Scandi noir to end all Scandi noirs: an atavistic revenge horror based on the Old Norse legend of Amleth, a young nobleman intent on bloody payback against the uncle who murdered his father and married his widowed mother; it’s the tale that inspired Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Among its many acts of hysterical violence, this film chops off the first syllable of Hamlet’s indecision; it hacks away the Elizabethan melancholy and existential hesitation that Shakespeare grafted on to his anguished hero, and turns him into a single-minded warrior who is very buff and roars with neck tendons flaring like peacock feathers. He is a loincloth-wearing, wolf’s-head-sporting guy who frankly isn’t that fussed about being or not being … or only in the sense that the former applies to him and the latter to his enemies. This drama very much takes Amleth away from the thespian green room and simplifies the story along Lion King lines (no Hakuna Matata though). Yet it also does away with the imbecility that the original Amleth feigned, which Shakespeare then transformed into an ambiguous ordeal of madness. “Amleth” means “stupid”, but Amleth is not that. Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, who as a boy witnessed the murder of his father King Aurvandil, played by Ethan Hawke. The culprits were henchmen in the pay of his saturnine, duplicitous uncle Fjölnir, played by Claes Bang. The murderer then marries Aurvandil’s queen Gudrún, played with a willowy yet steely and gimlet-eyed presence by Nicole Kidman. The first time we see Gudrún is when young Amleth (Oscar Novak) is told off by his mother for scampering into her bedroom while she is dressing: Eggers and co-screenwriter Sjón playfully encourage us to suspect that there will be some time in the future when Amleth will have a nakedly intimate encounter with his mother. So it proves – and Kidman gets an absolute showstopper of a scene. Little Amleth escapes and grows to hunky manhood obsessed with his brutal destiny: the story unfolds in a stark vista of unremitting violence, periodically switching from plangent colour to a kind of bleak monochrome for its various shroomy visions and prophetic confrontations. We have the traditional robust Viking banqueting scene at the very beginning, at which Fjölnir is irritated by Aurvandil’s capering jester Heimir, played by Willem Dafoe, who in death is to get a very disturbing Yorick-skull moment. Björk plays a witchy seer (from Scotland perhaps), taunting Amleth with his fate. Amleth returns from his exile in “the land of Rus” as a slave in the household of Fjölnir, there falling in love with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and his vengeance is not simply a matter of execution; he is to be a lightning-rod for the forces of terrible retribution that boom across the heavens. Along the way, the slaves are permitted some Midsommar-style frolicking, but must participate in a rough game which can only be described as Australian Rules Quidditch. The Northman is a horribly violent, nihilistic and chaotic story about the endless cycle of violence, the choice between loving your friends and hating your enemies – which turns out to be no choice at all, and the thread of fate down which masculinity’s delicious toxin drips. It’s entirely outrageous, with some epic visions of the flaring cosmos. I couldn’t look away."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"The Northman is a mystical waking nightmare of drama, adventure, and horror that combine into something truly dark, bewitching, and visceral."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"  Robert Eggers likes to explore the uncertainty of horrifying situations, whether through religion and doubt in 2015’s The Witch, or questioning one’s own sanity in 2019’s The Lighthouse. Eggers told both of these stories on a relatively small scale, mostly limited to a secluded house on the edge of the woods, or a claustrophobic lighthouse so small that even the lead character hits his head on the film’s aspect ratio. These confines have helped make Eggers such an effective filmmaker, and turned him into an orchestrator of these small-scale nightmares. Yet while witches and mermaids—as well as the fear of the world not making sense anymore—have plagued the characters in Eggers’ films, it’s that uncertainty that creeps in and gets under his character’s skins that makes Eggers’ first two films stories that are hard to shake long after they’re over.   Eggers’ third film, The Northman, however, gives the director a much larger canvas to explore, an expansive and grander vision that we’ve ever seen Eggers try to tackle before, but with that uncertainty still in tact and just as effective as ever. Co-written by Eggers and Sjón, The Northman follows the Viking warrior prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) on his journey for vengeance. As a child, Amleth saw his father, King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke), murdered by his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang). After witnessing the slaying of his father, Amleth swore to avenge his father, save his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman)—who was kidnapped by Fjölnir’s men—and kill Fjölnir.   The Northman at first feels distinctly like Eggers’ work in its strangeness, be it through characters like Willem Dafoe’s Heimir the Fool, or the unsettling nature of the time, when royalty can become slaves at any moment, and violence seems around every corner. But as The Northman progresses, Eggers’ penchant for uncertainty once again seeps into his story, as Amleth’s quest for revenge becomes full of skepticism. Yet in this uncertainty comes Eggers’ most focused theme to date, as Eggers and Sjón explore how evil begets evil, and how even the most black-and-white scenarios are full of gray. The Northman ultimately becomes a story about embracing love, compassion, and forgiveness, or falling to the more base desires of retribution.   Like all of Eggers’ work, The Northman has an inherent haunting quality to it. When we first see the adult Amleth, he’s more of an animal than a man. As Amleth and his team murder and pillage their way through a small village, Skarsgård almost presents himself like a beast, with hunched shoulders and a determination to kill anything that gets in his way. Even if at this early point, Amleth has tried to ignore his royal lineage, we can see the deep-seated rage that has lived in this man for decades. Eggers shoots this invasion almost like a combination between a horror film and Elem Klimov’s terrifying anti-war film, Come and See. Eggers shows our protagonist as an adult, then immediately reveals that his actions since we last saw him have been as bad—if not worse—than the actions of his murdering uncle.   Based on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth, who was William Shakespeare’s inspiration for Hamlet, The Northman isn’t exactly reinventing the Viking story, but instead, taking familiar elements and making them feel shocking and new through Eggers’ camera. As Amleth continues towards his goal, Eggers, along with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke—who has shot Eggers’ previous features—amp up the terrors. The anger starts to overcome Amleth, and we can see this through the wake he leaves behind him. Again, Eggers and Sjón aren’t necessarily doing much groundbreaking narratively, yet the determination to show the dread and panic of that period and in such a situation makes The Northman one of the more staggering Viking tales in recent memory.   Another key element that makes Eggers’ films so outstanding is capturing fantastic performances amongst his terrors, and that certainly remains true in The Northman. Skarsgård is remarkable as Amleth, showing the audience exactly what this character is thinking through nothing more than his sheer physicality. It’s almost as if Skarsgård is playing Amleth as a werewolf, transforming when the desire for blood becomes too much to bear. Balancing out Amleth’s fury is Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a sorceress who helps Amleth on his goal. As Olga says early on, Amleth can break men’s bodies, but she can break men’s minds, and similar to Amleth, we can see when Olga’s rage gets the better of her through the way she presents herself. Skarsgård and Taylor-Joy are tremendous together, a pairing that both needed, lest they succumb fully to the anger that rages inside them.   Beyond this pair, The Northman is packed with phenomenal performances, most of which are seen through the unreliable viewpoint of Amleth. Particularly brilliant are Kidman and Bang, in roles that almost require a second viewing to appreciate fully. Bang as Fjölnir is giving a quiet, reserved performance that shows a man trying to do the best with what he has left, whereas Kidman also plays Queen Gudrún with restraint, but Kidman’s opportunity to go all-in with the resentment within this character is one of The Northman’s best scenes.   Yet, if there’s one thing The Northman is missing from the rest of Eggers’ oeuvre, it is that lack of madness that made parts of The Witch and The Lighthouse almost feel like a catharsis. By the end of The Witch, Eggers provided that moment of embracing the hysteria of this situation, while The Lighthouse almost made an entire film around this feeling. But that part of Eggers’ sensibility is mostly absent here, occasionally popping up during The Northman’s most fantastical moments. It’s not a damning absence, but it does feel like The Northman could’ve integrated that insanity a bit more into this tale as well.   But mostly, it’s exciting to see Eggers working on this scale and thriving. Eggers’ style and striking imagery work beautifully within a story this sweeping and grandiose, and even on a larger scale, Eggers can still craft a film that feels oppressive in just the right ways. While this is Eggers’ least horror-centric story, he still utilizes many of the same techniques to engross the audience in the foreboding that this period must have induced in the people of that time. There are few filmmakers that can make the leap from smaller, insular stories into large-scale epics, but with The Northman, Eggers has proved that his style and substance can remain intact, regardless of the size of the story.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers films surely aren't for everyone, with The Witch leaning into a quiet unease instead of cackling crones beside a bubbling cauldron, while The Lighthouse is nearly two hours of Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson descending into a farting madness. His cinematic vision fails to be defined and constantly delivers audiences the unexpected, but with The Northman, he delivers what might be his most grounded and straightforward story thus far, which says a lot of his other films, when this adventure has multiple drug-fueled sequences with body parts being thrust into human cavities for psychedelic visions of a family's history. While The Northman toes the line of hallucinatory visuals and blood-soaked carnage, it's ultimately a reminder of the pointlessness of being driven solely by anger, all wrapped up in enough Nordic landscapes to make Odin proud. Years after watching his father King Aurvandill (Ethan Hawke) murdered, Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) sees the opportunity to enact his vengeance once and for all. His path of revenge isn't without its obstacles, with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy) presenting him with unique opportunities to fulfill his desires, or potentially force him to sacrifice his sole lot in life. Amleth sticks to a simple vow from the opening scenes of the film: ""I will avenge you, father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir."" It's this simple creed that motivates all of the events of the film, with that straightforwardness making the experience accessible to wider audiences. The overall endeavor is sure to feel reminiscent of other contemporary historical epics that are motivated by vengeance, along the lines of Gladiator, Braveheart, or even 300. It's in Eggers' deviations from this directness that the film both finds its victories and suffers its defeats. From the opening moments of the film, with its smoky volcanoes and grim oceanscapes, Eggers' vision is much more influenced by German expressionism than it is by action spectacle, delivering starkly contrasted images that feel both grounded yet highly stylized. The story structure will surely be familiar, but the mythology being embraced helps the film set itself apart from its peers, as it unfolds at a point in time where the worlds of men and gods have little distinction, with multiple sequences leaning fully into more ethereal exploits. Adding more otherworldliness to the adventure is the unique environments of the film, with the desolate cliffs and valleys of Iceland and Ireland evoking a much more surreal quality visually, offering yet another new perspective on the genre. While contemporary audiences might balk at the notion of gods having walked the Earth, Eggers' depictions of these worlds make this concept feel not only possible, but like a historical fact. With Eggers also sticking to the simple mantra of ""avenge father, save mother, kill Fjölnir,"" the narrative can stick to the core essence of revenge. Whereas the aforementioned historical epics feature bombastic battles and set pieces, The Northman rarely has more than a few dozen figures involved in any given scene, though most times we only see intimate exchanges between a handful of characters. This reflects the singularly focused mission of Amleth, reminding us of just how much someone sacrifices when they commit themselves to hatred as opposed to attempting to make any sort of peace with one's past. This devotion to this vengeance helps set the film apart from predecessors in how it trims all the fat from the story, though this devotion does also bring with it some of the film's setbacks. By stripping Amleth of any subtlety or nuance, the attempts to enrich his life with new connections to other characters feel forced and unearned. The cast does their best to make those connections feel organic and authentic, but the one-dimensional nature of how these characters are established limits their complexities early on, with these additional emotional layers then feeling artificial. Amleth demonstrates himself as a ruthless berserker, making it seem like looking out for his peers would be entirely out of the question, let alone that he would develop any actual emotional connection with anyone he meets. It makes the audience wish we either got to spend much more time with these characters to make those evolving dynamics feel genuine or had the run time trimmed to excise those elements entirely. Even with these superfluous components, the overall thesis of The Northman still serves as a reminder of how fruitless vengeance can be. Eggers makes it quite clear that, while there might be superficially engaging aspects to blood and chaos, this all comes at a massive cost. Amleth has a number of opportunities to pursue a much more fulfilling life, which comes with some satiating of his bloodlust, yet he commits to fulfilling what he perceives to be his fate. Most entries in this genre romanticize the honor of revenge, managing to make you root for the established hero, while Eggers uses The Northman to make you largely pity Amleth for his misguided priorities. The movie does fulfill the surface-level elements of a tale of revenge, though also reminds us that, no matter what sort of tragedies or trauma we suffered in our past, there's much to be learned from making peace with such experiences and growing from them. This makes The Northman serve more as a cautionary tale than a fetishization of violence in the name of fallacious honor. The Northman fully delivers on its promise of Nordic mayhem, managing to satiate the most bloodthirsty of audiences, while Eggers uses all of the tools at his disposal to elevate the concept into a nightmarish epic of blood and busted skulls. Even while making good on the premise's promise, the film stumbles a bit when it attempts to offer more than that setup, yet by sticking to that narrative urgency, the experience strips the adventure of the other artifices that have dominated the genre."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," 
They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But Robert Eggers makes the very good case that revenge is best served on the bloodied backs of hulking Viking brutes, whose feral howls of rage cut through the gray, icy, unforgiving Nordic tundras, and whose quests for vengeance are besieged by witches and war on all sides.

""The Northman,"" Eggers' visceral Viking revenge epic, is his first foray into the action genre, and is unquestionably the most ambitious film the director of ""The Witch"" and ""The Lighthouse"" has made, and perhaps his least interesting. But Eggers' bold injection of surreal, brutish artistry into the action epic is still miles more exciting, invigorating, and daring than most other big-budget tentpoles hitting theaters today, and a reminder that there's still fresh ground to tread in the age-old revenge narrative.

""The Northman"" stars Alexander Skarsgård as Amleth, an exiled prince of a Viking kingdom in the North Atlantic who has vowed revenge on his uncle Fjölnir (a grimly stoic Claes Bang) after Fjölnir killed his father (Ethan Hawke, all gravelly gravitas) and kidnapped his mother (a scene-stealing Nicole Kidman, subtly bringing a sharp twistedness to the role). But Amleth (played in his youth by a wide-eyed Oscar Novak) escaped his fate by biting off the nose of the soldier that Fjölnir sent to kill him, leading the shamed soldier to claim that Amleth had died.

Twenty years later, Amleth has become a hardened member of a band of Viking berserkers (often shirtless, bloodied, and howling, like some kind of feral SWAT team) who regularly raid villages and capture slaves for various Nordic kings. After receiving a vision of an eyeless seer (Bjork, striking and terrifying in her brief big-screen return) who reminds him of his vow for vengeance, he hears that one group of slaves will be sent to King Fjölnir, whose stolen kingdom has been conquered and who now rules over little more than a farmstead in Iceland. Jolted back to life by this stroke of fate, Amleth cuts the long hair that marked him as a berserker and stows away as a slave on the boat toward Iceland, striking up an unexpected connection with fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, magnificent and bewitching), who offers him her cunning mind and witch-like powers to aid his quest. But when he arrives in the barren land where the remains of his former kingdom now live, Amleth's quest takes a turn for the strange, as he embraces his fate as a vessel of cosmic righteousness and bloody, bloody divine punishment.

Skarsgård has never been better or more suited to a role than in ""The Northman"" which unleashes the actor's full Nordic might and a terrifying rage that he's rarely displayed onscreen before. He's equal turns haunted and hulking as Amleth, a force of pure vengeance who ends up softening throughout the film as he discovers reasons to live beyond his quest for revenge. It's a trickier role to nail than one might think — ""The Northman"" expects Skarsgård to be a likable protagonist who can bleed, and fear, and love, as well as a pure force of divine vengeance through which the film's more uncanny elements can play out. And Skarsgård, alternately stoic, soulful, and full-on feral, manages to do both.

Twenty years later, Amleth has become a hardened member of a band of Viking berserkers (often shirtless, bloodied, and howling, like some kind of feral SWAT team) who regularly raid villages and capture slaves for various Nordic kings. After receiving a vision of an eyeless seer (Bjork, striking and terrifying in her brief big-screen return) who reminds him of his vow for vengeance, he hears that one group of slaves will be sent to King Fjölnir, whose stolen kingdom has been conquered and who now rules over little more than a farmstead in Iceland. Jolted back to life by this stroke of fate, Amleth cuts the long hair that marked him as a berserker and stows away as a slave on the boat toward Iceland, striking up an unexpected connection with fellow slave Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy, magnificent and bewitching), who offers him her cunning mind and witch-like powers to aid his quest. But when he arrives in the barren land where the remains of his former kingdom now live, Amleth's quest takes a turn for the strange, as he embraces his fate as a vessel of cosmic righteousness and bloody, bloody divine punishment. Skarsgård has never been better or more suited to a role than in ""The Northman"" which unleashes the actor's full Nordic might and a terrifying rage that he's rarely displayed onscreen before. He's equal turns haunted and hulking as Amleth, a force of pure vengeance who ends up softening throughout the film as he discovers reasons to live beyond his quest for revenge. It's a trickier role to nail than one might think — ""The Northman"" expects Skarsgård to be a likable protagonist who can bleed, and fear, and love, as well as a pure force of divine vengeance through which the film's more uncanny elements can play out. And Skarsgård, alternately stoic, soulful, and full-on feral, manages to do both. To call ""The Northman"" a weird action epic is both underselling and overselling it. The film is Eggers' most accessible film yet, using the familiar structure of a revenge narrative to deliver surreal cosmic imagery and brief brushes with the fantastical, before returning to that ""Hamlet""-style tragedy that we all know and love. More accurately, ""The Northman"" is like ""Gladiator"" crossed with ""The Green Knight"" — at once familiar and satisfying as a revenge story, and simultaneously baffling and beguiling. But for all the visions of a cackling, eye-less Bjork, or skeletal warriors that spring to life, or blue-eyed gods who scream in triumph as they ride through the skies, ""The Northman"" never quite makes the same bone-chilling, skin-crawling impact as Eggers' previous two films. There is little of the creeping ambiguity of ""The Witch"" or the wild debauchery of ""The Lighthouse,"" though the bone-crunching gore and dashes of cosmic mystery prevent ""The Northman"" from being anything close to ""mainstream."" It's as if ""The Green Knight"" got passed through a ""bro"" filter, the glimpses of the supernatural made more palatable by the brutal male fantasy that constitutes a Viking revenge epic. But even if the male fantasy elements overtake the weird fantasy parts of ""The Northman,"" the two of them are far from incompatible — if anything, the combination heightens the singular vision that Eggers has for the film. The story simultaneously feels like a mythic age-old tale that has emerged from the bowels of the Earth — compounded by the film's bellowing, disembodied introduction, the visions of ghostly ancestors hanging from trees, the frequent flirtations with witchcraft — and like a grim, grounded war movie, in which the battle scenes play out in a slow, weighty, almost plodding manner, meticulously choreographed to be as brutish and realistic as possible. The film's gray, grimy color palette adds to this realistic approach, so palpable that it seeps over into the occasional flashes of the fantastical. It's when the film meets between these two modes — the mythic and the realistic — that it's at its most thrilling. Early on, in a scene where Hawke's King Aurvandil and his supernaturally-gifted fool Heimir (Willem Dafoe, in full creature mode) induct Amleth into manhood through some kind of primal ritual where the three of them howl and snarl like wolves within a dimly lit cavern, it feels like ""The Northman"" has tapped into some terrifying beyond that feels unpredictable, unfathomable, and better left untouched. Sometimes the film walks this balance precariously, potentially alienating its audience with these more eerie touches, but that's when it feels truest to Eggers' vision of ""The Northman,"" whatever it may be."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Performance, setting, look, and sound come together to create an engaging fantasy that will wow. With meticulously choreographed fight sequences and a distinct aesthetic, The Northman succeeds where other stories like 2007's Beowulf and 2006's 300 fail."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEUTRAL," The film has a lot going for it, fantastic battle scenes & mysticism that elevates the protagonist’s journey, but it is lacking in overall character.  Directed by Robert Eggers (who co-wrote the screenplay with Sjón), The Northman is a fascinating story of revenge — at least on the surface. A son avenging his father’s murder is a gruesome affair in The Northman, with Eggers leaning into Norse mythology and the legend of Amleth, who inspired William Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The film has a lot going for it, fantastic battle scenes and mysticism that elevates the protagonist’s journey, but it is lacking in overall character.   Young Amleth (Oscar Novak) is thrilled that his father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) is back, celebrating a victory against an enemy. Aurvandil believes it’s time for Amleth to become a man, and so he takes him to Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe), a jester and priest, to begin his training. However, everything changes for Amleth when his father is attacked and killed in front of his eyes and his mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), captured. Years later, an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) seeks to avenge his father and save his mother, leading him on a journey to restore his family’s honor and take back the life that was stolen from him.   The Northman lacks a sense of nuance in its characters and in its story. There is very little learned about Amleth following his father’s murder or how he came to be found by the Berserkers, a violent group who attack a village and kill most of its people. It’s hard to fully be invested in his character when there isn’t much depth to be found there beyond the obvious. Amleth’s mission is straightforward, but Eggers could have done a lot more to push his actions beyond the basic need to kill his father’s murderer, especially when he learns quite a few things about the past he had not known before. To that end, The Northman feels like it barely scratches the surface of its story, leaving the audience with crumbs rather than a full feast.   The use of Norse mythology is excellent, however, often unnerving and striking at once. Mysticism is employed to both startle and aid Amleth in his revenge, which infuses the film with a tremendous amount of excitement and intrigue each time. Visually, The Northman is stunning, with cinematographer Jarin Blaschke boosting the film’s color palette with variations on light, shadow, and striking gray tones that inform and shape each scene, as well as Amleth’s journey throughout. There is a gruesome ruthlessness to everything, with Eggers going all out in the brutality of it all. The battle scenes are well-choreographed, with the village takeover especially being a standout as the camera tracks the chaos and Amleth’s own movements without losing sight of the sheer violence and heartbreak of the moment. It is bloody and filled with rage, something which keeps the momentum of the film from plummeting.   Alexander Skarsgård really leans into playing Amleth like a beast who is let loose on his prey. His eyes are set, watching Fjölnir, Amleth’s uncle, with an intensity that lingers and never dies. The actor is certainly passionate in the role, though there could have been a bit more done to elevate the emotional aspects of his plight. Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún has a couple of moments that fully allow her character to take shape and Kidman excellently plays them exceptionally well. From Claes Bang to Anya Taylor-Joy, the cast gives all they have to make their characters fully realized people the audience can understand and even sympathize with on occasion. If there’s one thing that could have been given a boost, it’s the romance between Skarsgård’s Amleth and Taylor-Joy’s Olga, which is half-baked at best.   While The Northman has a lot to offer and is quite beautiful and masterful in its execution, there is something missing. The film begins to meander a bit in the middle before getting back on track and the lack of additional character development — anything that would have given the film more depth — prevents The Northman from reaching its full potential. By the end of it all, audiences might find they wanted a bit more from the story, even as they were brought into the passion and violence of Amleth’s vengeance so viscerally.   The Northman releases in theaters on April 22, 2022. The film is 136 minutes long and is rated R for strong bloody violence, some sexual content and nudity.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers movies are instruments of time travel. Any screen projecting 2015’s The Witch becomes a window that lets us peer into the world of 1630s New England, and 2019’s The Lighthouse does the same thing with the same region 260 years later – both films bleeding authenticity even when veering into fantasy and the supernatural. His latest, The Northman, once again replicates this fascinating immersion, albeit this time while outfitting audiences with a Doctor Who-esque universal translator that lets you hear Old Norse as English. Of course, Eggers’ great skill delivered alongside the remarkable, realistic aesthetics is his ability to layer in genre storytelling – and in this respect, The Northman is his most compelling film yet. In cinematically wrangling a centuries-old Viking myth, the director and co-writer Sjón execute a cold blooded and savage revenge tale that delivers powerful, emotional, and personal stakes while also examining the price of a life dedicated to vengeance. It’s both Eggers’ most intense and most accessible movie of the three he’s made, and matches visceral filmmaking with tremendous performances from an ensemble cast led by Alexander Skarsgård. The Northman is the legend of Amleth, the story that inspired William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and with a prayer to Odin the film opens on the North Atlantic in 895 AD as the hero as a young boy (Oscar Novak) anticipates the long-awaited arrival of King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke). The king has been away at war for almost all of Amleth’s life, but upon his return and reunion with Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), he initiates the prince into adulthood. Son and father form a tight bond, forged with an oath of vengeance should the monarch be slain by an enemy’s sword, but tragically their time together is short. Amleth’s uncle, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), commits treason and conspires with a small group to brutally assassinate the king. Their plan is to also kill the prince, but he manages to escape after slicing off the nose of one of Fjölnir’s men (Eldar Skar). Amleth is presumed dead, but in reality he takes a boat and rows to safety – swearing to avenge his father, save his mother, and kill his uncle. Decades later, an adult Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) has become a ferocious and animalistic Viking, part of a clan that raids villages and sells hostages as slaves. Following a violent and successful pillage, he has an encounter with an eyeless seeress (Björk) who prophesies his retribution, and he overhears that an allotment of prisoners are to be brought to a sheep farm in Iceland owned by Fjölnir – who himself has had his crown stolen. Amleth sneaks on to a departing ship, his clandestine arrival noticed only by Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a girl from the village he destroyed, and he plots to work among the slaves until it is time to reveal his true identity, rescue his mother, and murder Fjölnir. The Northman wastes no time filling your eyes with spectacle, its opening frames showcasing a volcano mid-eruption as a booming voice calls to the king of the Norse gods, and while the story is ultimately an intimate affair, your mind is frequently treated to breathtaking visions of nature that enhance the scale of the movie with their majesty. There is a complete lack of opulence, as everything from the costuming to the production design feels dirty and of the Earth, and it provides a feral power to the background of the hero’s quest. It’s raw. The amazement that it inspires in capturing our world in an ancient age is further enhanced by an ever-simmering rage in the film’s tone. It’s a horror movie in a much broader sense than The Witch or The Lighthouse, but it’s no less shocking, as Robert Eggers frequently unfurls moments of barbarity and dark mysticism that provide full body gooseflesh and compel whispering “Holy shit” in a dark theater. You get a pretty good sense of what you’re getting with the introduction of Amleth as an adult, as a remarkable invasion sequence sees him cutting down enemies and ripping out a throat with his teeth, but that, pun absolutely intended, proves just to be the appetizer. Your jaw is so often left gaping in awe from its stunning cinematography and in terror from its ferocity to the point you might just resign yourself to keeping it open for the duration of the film. The unrelenting nature of The Northman could be a total turnoff that makes you just want to run to the closest shower, but a huge part of the film that keeps its hooks in you is Alexander Skarsgård’s performance. Given what we’ve seen from him over the course of his career, it was really only a matter of time before a big screen project came along that would let him fully show off his dramatic skills, and his turn here grabs your attention like a wolf growling and bearing its teeth five inches from your face. He wholly embodies the Viking prince, and it’s both a phenomenal and scary thing to see. What makes it all the more impressive is that it’s not just all overflowing id, and Anya Taylor-Joy’s Olga has a lot to do with that. It was her performance in The Witch that first turned heads in the industry, and once again Robert Eggers gets magic out of her (literally). Her confidence, cunning, and general witchiness is magnetic, and properly reflected in her relationship with Amleth – which ends up creating layers in Skarsgård’s turn, with his character torn between his oath to his father and a potential path to a happy, violence-free life with the woman he grows to love. The cast is full of surprises and treats, from Nicole Kidman making some big choices that bizarrely work, to Willem Dafoe being an impish delight, but The Northman is Alexander Skarsgård’s show, and he is impressive. Narratively speaking, The Northman isn’t particularly complex, featuring familiar revenge story beats as Amleth affirms the fate foretold to him by the seeress, but it’s made with such passion and virility that it’s hypnotizing and just feels special. It’s a work that further solidifies Robert Eggers as a modern auteur, and while it’s everything you want it to be as a continuation of his career, it’s also a film that will hopefully expose his talents to an even wider audience – further expanding his ability to make any movie that he wants to make.

"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," A young prince watches in terror as his father, the king, is murdered. The killer turns on the prince, but he escapes, survives, and years later, reappears to reclaim the throne and get his revenge. That’s the very basic setup for The Northman, the powerful and moving new film by co-writer and director Robert Eggers. And while it’s a story you’ve seen before, you’ve never seen it like this. In his first two films, The Witch and The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers exploded onto the scene with a very distinct, unique filmmaking style. Each was a period film with a genre spin, visualized with lush, muted colors, filled with elevated language and dense mythology that made them seem less like fiction and more like historical documents. Critics adored the films but one could argue they were a bit too abstract and weird for general audiences. Well, The Northman is the next evolution of that. It’s a film that looks, sounds, and feels like the previous two, but with a more familiar, commercial story. It’s not Eggers’ best film (We’d give that to The Witch), but it’s his most accessible, and certainly the most exciting.  After a dark, trippy prologue in which King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke) returns home from war only to be killed by his brother Fjölnir (Claes Bang), The Northman picks up a few decades later. The king’s son Amleth, now played by Alexander Skarsgård, was forced to abandon his royal life in order to survive and now lives and works with a group of savage warriors. One day, he hears a rumor about what happened to his traitorous uncle and mother Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman), Amleth instantly throws away everything and goes off to do the three things he’s been vowing to do since he was a child: “I will avenge you father. I will save you, mother. I will kill you Fjölnir.” In the first half-hour or so, as all of the above is being set up, The Northman is electric. Eggers moves his camera through massive practical sets filled with mud, giving the story a gritty grounded reality. Action scenes in these settings are brutal and beautifully choreographed, with a minimal amount of edits, making the fights visceral and powerful. That changes, though, once Amleth goes off to find his uncle. The Northman goes from a more traditional historical epic with tons of men running around with swords shirtless, to a much smaller, almost psychological thriller. Amleth embeds himself with his uncle’s people and, with the help of Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), who he met and began to fall for on the way there, the two wreak havoc on Amleth’s enemies. None of this is boring, but there are a few bumps in the road. First of all, there’s a certain suspension of disbelief that must happen in order to buy into Amleth ending up at Fjölnir’s doorstep so quickly. The narrative explains it, but it still feels a little too easy and coincidental. Plus, this latter half of the movie works more like a sequel than a cohesive continuation. That’s in part due to the later scenes mostly taking place in the lush hills of Iceland, but also that the action-packed opening act takes a back seat for anticipation and suspense. Amleth must be careful with his true identity so he and Olga can quietly build up their plan. As a result, the change in setting and pacing takes some getting used to. Once all that’s settled though, which happens fairly quickly, Eggers slowly starts to push down on the gas pedal. Scene after scene revels in the satisfying slow burn of Amleth dolling out violent, cathartic revenge, piece by piece.  Then things really get cooking. As The Northman finally starts to see the finish line, Eggers’ script (which he co-wrote with Icelandic author Sjón) takes some daring twists and turns leading up to the inevitable final showdown which is simply put, one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen on film. It’s as if George Lucas filmed the finale of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith for real. Real swords, real lava, real stakes. It’s a remarkable finale with stunning cinematography from Jarin Blaschke. As beautiful as that scene and, frankly, the rest of the movie is, it wouldn’t work if we didn’t believe the characters, and the cast has some real standouts. As the leads, Alexander Skarsgård and Anya Taylor-Joy pull off a beautiful ying-yang set of performances. Skarsgård is deadly serious at the start but as the film moves on, becomes increasingly vulnerable. Conversely, Taylor- Joy begins as a defeated slave and slowly grows into a cunning, formidable, force of nature. The two work well together, though their love story never hits as hard as it’s meant to. Supporting performances by Hawke, Bang, and Willem Dafoe all add gravitas to the story, but it’s Nicole Kidman as Queen Gudrún who really steals the show. She has some incredibly intense, emotionally complex moments, and you believe every second. The Northman isn’t a movie for everybody, but it’s the Robert Eggers movie that’s probably for the widest audience. It probably also has the most bodies. He doesn’t shy away from the R-rated violence, which is particularly gut-wrenching in this film, nor does he give up on using eloquent, lyrical language throughout and infusing the film with dense mythological narratives. If anything, that mythology can at times get in the way of the film’s momentum. One early scene in particular (featuring Björk as “The Slav Witch”) is so densely packed with crucial information that you better hope you don’t zone out for a second or you’ll be completely lost. But that’s Eggers. He doesn’t make movies for casual viewing. He makes films that demand you pay attention and with The Northman, we’ll continue to pay attention to this rising filmmaking star."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers is a filmmaker who has quickly developed a reputation. It’s hardly a bad one, either. It’s simply one that suggests an immersive and singular experience that won’t be for everyone. So, what would it look like if Eggers took at least a small step towards the mainstream? Well, The Northman suggests something still very much his own, while offering up brutal yet crystal clear action. In making a violent Viking epic, he’s found a way to craft a revenge tale that audiences will go for, while not compromising his style. While not quite as weird as The Lighthouse or The Witch (or The VVitch, if you’d prefer), you’ll never mistake this for garden variety studio fare. The Northman is Eggers doing a Viking version of Hamlet, which is an interesting pairing. On the one hand, it all plays out in a very clear cut manner. Explaining the story here won’t require too much effort and no one will ever scratch their head. Seeing how it’s depicted though, that’s another story. While this isn’t as obtuse as some of his prior flicks, The Northman still sees Eggers doing it his way. That’s a good thing, too. Especially on an epic scale like this, you just never see this sort of a vision allowed to exist. In tenth century Iceland, we meet young Prince Amleth (Oscar Novak) on the verge of manhood. His father, King Aurvandil War-Raven (Ethan Hawke) has returned from battle to his son, as well as his wife, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Worried that his son is not ready for the realities of this brutal world, he begins a ritual with him, under the supervision of Heimir the Fool (Willem Dafoe). The next day, while out in the woods, Amleth sees his father brutally murdered by his uncle, Fjölnir the Brotherless (Claes Bang), taking the throne and kidnapping the boy’s mother in the process. Amleth escapes death, vowing revenge in the process. Two decades later, a grown Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is now a vicious Viking, raiding Slavic villages, but with a singular goal in mind. All that matters is saving his mother, killing his uncle, and avenging his father. A chance encounter with Olga of the Birch Forest (Anya Taylor-Joy) helps set him on the path to put this plan into motion. Much death ensues. Everyone in the cast is completely committed to this vision. While I don’t know that there are any standouts, everyone knows exactly what they’re making and supports Eggers in achieving his goals. Alexander Skarsgård in particular is sort of a tool for the filmmaker, but it works. Eggers veterans like Willem Dafoe and Anya Taylor-Joy are also clearly happy to be on hand to watch him work again, even if the former doesn’t have a ton to do. The same goes for Ethan Hawke, but he’s obviously relishing the opportunity. Claes Bang and Nicole Kidman get surprising angles to their characters, but the focus is still mainly on Skarsgård. Supporting players here, in addition to the aforementioned Oscar Novak, include Björk, Olwen Fouéré, Gustav Lindh, Ineta Sliuzaite, and many more. Filmmaker Robert Eggers doesn’t know how to make it easy on himself, but the results definitely speak for themselves. His script, co-written by the poet Sjón, is as precise as his direction. The second act doesn’t quite engage as much as what bookends it, which is notable with a more than two hour running time, but it’s never a boring movie. Everything is clear, crisp, and even the more ridiculous elements are given weight. It’s a big gamble of a film, and if it doesn’t quite go for broke, it still walks a tightrope that’s impressive to witness. The Northman is destined to be a bit of a cult favorite, but it may also have a chance at more. Audiences just don’t get this sort of scale anymore in things that aren’t dumbed down, so there’s a shot that this film really does catch on. Even if the box office doesn’t ultimately suggest it, this is the kind of movie to celebrate. Mostly, you’re left wanting more, both from Eggers, and from other filmmakers who can paint on a grand canvas like this."
"Apr 11, 2022",NEGATIVE," As floridly written and meticulously etched as they are, at their core the ornate period works of director Robert Eggers summon an elemental human conundrum: the constant clash between free will and the unexplainable in the construction of one’s fate. If there are forces beyond our control meddling in our mortal existences, must we surrender or can we fight back? Exponentially larger in scope, and less cryptic in its themes, Eggers’ latest cinematic waltz with the uncanny, “The Northman,” plunges into blood-soaked mythology to induce a primal trance. Co-written with Icelandic poet Sjón (also co-writer of last year’s “Lamb”), this 10th century Viking saga sets itself apart from epics fleshed out around similar eras by maintaining Eggers’ aesthetic ambivalence, which plays with the grittily solemn and the darkly magical. Though as exhilaratingly violent as one of its most obvious filmic cousins with Nordic ties, Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Valhalla Rising,” “The Northman” stays true to Eggers’ more offbeat sensibilities, contrasting gruesome imagery of brutally slaughtered bodies with the ethereal mysticism of a hero’s visions, whether of his past and future family tree, alarming premonitions, or ancient deities. This tonal originality in a big-budget production that reinterprets ancient tales aligns the “The Northman” with recent titles such as Justin Kurzel’s under-loved but stunning “Macbeth,” and even David Lowery’s “The Green Knight.” All of these releases harness their imposing, historically inspired production design, large-scale set pieces, and star-studded casts to mold experiences that transcend what audiences have come to expect from grand spectacles. A “child born of savagery,” prince Amleth (first played by young actor Oscar Novak) undergoes a scatological rite of passage into manhood in 895 AD Scandinavia. His father, King Aurvandil (a ferociously committed Ethan Hawke), a ruler obsessed with dying in battle to reach his god Ódinn with honor, and trusted servant Heimir (a kooky Willem Dafoe), conduct the communion of energies in one of the film’s most strangely intoxicating sequences. In near darkness, with all participants sporting wild faces and uttering beastly sounds, this mind-altering ritual puts the sensorial power of the film medium in full display. But though the boy has now been inducted into the legacy of his kin, a classic royal betrayal warps his destiny: Amleth’s uncle Fjölnir (a stoic Claes Bang) murders Aurvandil to take over the kingdom. The premise of “The Northman” is a simple one. It tells of a fallen leader and the heir whose sole purpose for breathing is to avenge him, rescue the captured queen (an unnerving Nicole Kidman), and murder the traitor. This sacred to-do list becomes a mantra repeated by the long-haired brute Amleth (a character that directly inspired Shakespeare’s timeless tragedy “Hamlet”) becomes years later in hiding and embodied by muscular Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård. Eggers’ preferred cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who has lensed all three of his movies, lights “The Northman” in a deliberately rudimentary fashion for the sequences in the present, with the glow of flames against the darkness of the night being a recurrent theme—almost as if his frames were cave paintings of early men. An early scene of Amleth among the Rus people that take him after he escapes Fjölnir, shows a group of warriors embracing their animalistic prowess around a campfire. That roaring scene speaks of a raw masculinity that can so easily turn into dangerous, unchecked machismo in a pack of like-minded individuals. Later, prisoners condemned to servitude find a moment of solace dancing and indulging near a blaze, a moment that reminisces of the “The Witch.” There’s also a heart-racing pivotal battle amid rivers of lava that plays out almost in silhouettes. Besides the vastness of the wide shots that capture the grandeur of the terrain the story crosses—from mainland Scandinavia to Iceland—Blaschke’s cinematography is also noteworthy for its approach to instances of grace, coating them in either dazzling moonlight or the fantastical color palette of the northern lights for Amleth’s dreams of riding into the afterlife guided by Valkyrie. Sonically, the chapters that comprise “The Northman” are marked by the loud pounding of drums constantly startling and preparing us for war. In general, the atmospheric music composed by Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough carries ominousness, like a call to arms because the entire odyssey leads to a final confrontation of monumental proportions. Almost anthropological in its unflinching depiction of barbarism in centuries past, “The Northman” follows Amleth from being part of the enslavement and murder of neighboring peoples by the Rus, events that exemplify how monstrous humans behave when seeking power, to willingly becoming a slave himself in order to get closer to vengeance. Eggers depicts the atrocities both bluntly, with beheadings and full-contact combat, and in an implied, yet shocking manner with acts that we don’t see in full but that we understand as abhorrent. One look at current headlines of modern-day warfare affirms not much has changed over a thousand years later. Now the hard metal of axes and spears has mutated into high caliber ammunition and drone strikes. In one of these campaigns of merciless destruction, Amleth meets Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), a captured woman that takes an interest in his unwavering determination as they struggle through forced labor. While he schemes to murder Fjölnir, she shows him tenderness foreign to him under the stars on the beautifully inhospitable volcanic terrain of Iceland. With animalistic virulence, Skarsgård takes on a role at first burning with sheer adrenaline. A guttural scream in nature or the power of inflicting physical pain on others functions as outlets for the hatred that consumes him. There’s an unrestrained quality to the performance in the first half that turns into something more layered as Amleth must conceal his intentions towards his enemies and discovers another reason to keep going in Olga. A superb Skarsgård balances the bodily vigorousness required with the shattered innocence that defines his part. A parentless child, robbed of family, Amleth is unable and ultimately unwilling, to overcome the trauma that has marred his life. The interesting psychological profile that Eggers and Sjón built for their wolfskin-clad protagonist hinges on his emotionally stunted childhood. A single tear frozen in time reminds him of the last time he was allowed to display weakness. Via its multiple narrative elements dealing with masculinity, “The Northman” proves it doesn’t glorify the viciousness but presents a man posed with the reality of what could be if he leaves it behind. Returning to one of her most effective modes, that of a cruel mother, Kidman sharpens her tongue for a poisonous speech. But as cruel as her piercing words may sound, what the queen expresses boils down to the notion that there’s more than honor to strive for, that defeat could mean a chance to focus on love, that the blinding desire for glory clouds Amleth’s ability to see another path. Such an accusation is proven right soon after. Victory sacrifices the possibility of a future, but in the end the avenger gets a sense of having fulfilled both desires. He strikes an equilibrium between the opposite poles pulling at him."
"Apr 11, 2022",POSITIVE," Robert Eggers’s feature films up to this point have been marked by a sharp focus on the uneasy relationship between the eerily isolated environments in which they’re set and the lost souls who populate them. Drawing on his background as a production designer, Eggers meticulously recreates remote settings from another time that reflect his characters’ frenzied states of mind. The filmmaker now widens his view significantly in The Northman, a grandiose Viking saga that traverses vast Icelandic terrains and takes with it a cast of characters substantially larger than that of The Witch and The Lighthouse combined. The film tells the tale of Amleth, a Viking prince fated to avenge his father’s murder. We first meet Amleth, a figure from Scandinavian legend who inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, as a boy (Oscar Novak), ecstatic upon the brief return home of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke), from war overseas. But in the midst of a bonding session where father and son howl at each other like wolves (as in The Lighthouse, flatulence is a means of asserting dominance here), Aurvandil is killed by his jealous brother, Fjölnir (Claes Bang), who then decimates Aurvandil’s kingdom and kidnaps Amleth’s mother, Queen Gudrún (Nicole Kidman). Years after his narrow escape into the wilderness, Amleth (now played by Alexander Skarsgård) is part of a Viking tribe that raids small villages across Slavic countrysides. The preternaturally skilled and ripped warrior plows through his opponents with merciless ease, with Eggers gleefully fetishizing the hyperreal action in a way that has become de rigueur in the years since the orgiastic, CGI-forward tango of bloodletting that is Zack Snyder’s 300 was released. But Amleth is no heartless savage. While his Viking cohorts taunt and terrorize the women and children that they conquer, Amleth sits forlornly off to the side—the resident sad boy of the group who broods over a past that has brought him to a despicable way of life. Amleth, though, is reminded of his long-ago vow to himself—“I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir”—upon learning that the captives from his most recent raid are being sent to work on a farm in Iceland that’s owned by none other than his duplicitous uncle. While The Northman’s prototypical story happily pledges its allegiance to the cinematic tradition of the bluntly aggressive historical action epic, Eggers and co-writer Sjón marginally upend expectations in the initially subtle way that Amleth embarks on his mission. Ditching his Viking tribe, he arrives in Iceland to find Fjölnir and Gudrún presiding over their land with a new adolescent child between them, both failing to recognize Amleth as a grown man. And as he ingratiates himself into Fjölnir’s world by posing as a hardworking and loyal slave, the film morphs into something of a Norse spin on a domestic psychological thriller. Amleth faces constant harassment by Fjölnir’s boastful adult son, Thórir (Gustav Lindh), and you sense in Skarsgård’s fraught visage our hero’s struggle to unleash his awesome might. At its strongest, The Northman is fiercely focused on Amleth’s need to manage his own damage control—to channel it into something almost unfathomable. And so, by night, he sneaks about committing treacherous and violent acts to undermine his uncle’s hold on power. “I will haunt this farm like a hungry corpse back from the dead,” he hisses at one point. This setup also allows Eggers to indulge in some gleefully gruesome shock tactics, like when the farm’s denizens awake to find the dismembered bodies of Thórir’s friends pinned to the side of a hut. A subsequent mass hallucination that causes Fjölnir’s lackeys to inflict harm on themselves further inches the film into the terrain of the supernatural, solidifying the vice grip of fear that constricts the homestead as Amleth skulks about like a ghostly agent of fate. It’s somewhat disappointing, then, that The Northman reveals itself to be so programmatic. Amleth eventually drops his ruse in order to save his love interest, the ethereal slave girl Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), kicking off a third act that proceeds through all the conventional beats of countless revenge fantasies. While still proficiently staged, this turn toward tradition serves to render a potentially singular experience into a relatively familiar one. Similarly, The Northman’s landscape imagery feels like a step down for a filmmaker who once seemed intent on imbuing his settings with an unnerving sense of character, as in the forest clearing of The Witch and the seaside outpost of The Lighthouse. Yet while this film’s canvas is considerably broader, it feels as if its psychological chaos hasn’t expanded accordingly. From Amleth’s meeting with an ominous seeress (Björk) all the way to the cryptic chapter titles that mark our hero’s journey, The Northman clearly aims to keep one foot in the realm of the enigmatic—and to maybe say something grand about life, death, and fate along the away. But unlike Nicolas Winding Refn’s Valhalla Rising, a Viking-age head trip that’s steadfastly committed to its vibe of abstract expressionism, Eggers’s film is sometimes frustratingly shackled to the obligations of plot. It doesn’t lack for blood and guts, but it doesn’t play enough in the well of the weird, and missing here is that haunting sense of the elemental and oneness between people and place that animates The Witch and The Lighthouse. Mark Hanson is a film writer and curator from Toronto, Canada, and the product manager at Bay Street Video, one of North America's last remaining video stores. I like this review.
