"Feb 5, 2018",NEGATIVE," (CNN) -- It's something of an over-simplification, of course, but I've always felt that there are two basic approaches to telling a story on film.  There's the plot-driven way, in which a three act structure - Ask an interesting question/Make it exciting as the audience awaits an answer/Answer the question - has the audience wondering what might happen next.  The sense of anticipation is why they keep paying attention. Then there's the character-driven technique, in which the nuances of the protagonist's thought processes are what's keeping things afloat.  The story can't be non-existent in this kind of movie, but it's not the main focus of attention.  Think of stuff like ""Taxi Driver.""  It's a stunning film, but what's it really ""about"" besides the twisted mind of a lonely man? Among many other things, Clint Eastwood's new movie, ""True Crime,"" would have benefited greatly from a clear decision as to which format should goose the plot into action.  Eastwood directed, and that explains the movie's near-glacial pacing, but this is a downright awful screenplay, one that suffers from clichéd characters, simplistic revelations, inappropriate comic relief, and a steadfastly bizarre sense of what's important from one minute to the next. It was written by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman, and Stephen Schiff, and (once again) Hollywood's penchant for passing the baton from writer to writer has resulted in something that more closely resembles a stew than a movie. It's all wrong; Eastwood is even miscast.  And he gives one of his poorest performances.  He plays a reformed alcoholic newspaper reporter named Steve Everett who's considered to be such a loser by his bosses (James Woods and Denis Leary), he only receives the job of writing a human interest piece on a condemned man (Isaiah Washington) after the original reporter dies in a car crash. One of the pointless subplots has to do with Everett's philandering, and his most recent conquest is actually Leary's character's wife.  When Leary finds out about it, the revelation leads to some smartsy repartee and a couple of sexist jokes from Woods, but the fireworks are evidently being kept in storage for the Fourth of July.  It amounts to absolutely nothing. The ladies' man angle is a little too much to bear right off the bat, and the audience was actually groaning over it.  Eastwood may have some craggy good looks left on him, but the sight of our hero lolling around on a bed with his shirt off as a woman half his age runs her hands over his supposedly alluring torso is a tad more than ridiculous.  (His skin looks like bark that's been stretched over an outrigger canoe frame.) Everett is also supposed to have recently lost his job at The New York Times for having slept with the boss' 18-year-old daughter.  That makes her one quarter as old as the High Plains Drifter, folks.  It's embarrassing.  There's not a .44 Magnum in sight, but Eastwood still wants us to be impressed with his big gun. The movie is purportedly about Everett's attempts to prove the prisoner's innocence just 12 hours before he's to be executed, but he doesn't even come face-to-face with the guy until 65 minutes into the movie (I checked my watch.)  Before that you get lame little character interludes, like a weird bit of business with a wino in front of the newspaper office and cute conversations with Eastwood's laconic co-workers. Then there's the visit to the zoo that Eastwood is forced to take with his young daughter.  It turns out to be nothing more than an extended gag that isn't particularly funny, then we're back to inelegant cross-cuts between the tearful family at the prison and Eastwood's attempts to unravel the mystery of who actually did the killing. Woods' ""character"" (he eats junk food and yells a lot) makes a sarcastic, disbelieving remark about the feasibility of Clint digging up clues in 45 minutes that nobody involved in the case managed to sniff out in the past six years, and I'll be damned if I didn't wholeheartedly agree with him. I have to say, I was honestly shocked at how unfocused and derivative this thing is.  Half the scenes seem like wandering time-fillers, and the ones that have some life to them aren't much more intriguing than your average episode of ""The Streets of San Francisco."" But it's the insistence on marching out those oddball characters that have basically zero effect on the proceedings that really threw me.  Foremost among them is a Catholic priest played by Michael McKean who's just an unctuous jerk.  His scene in which he ""comforts"" Washington, only to drive him into a rage, is plain stupid.  I honestly had my jaw hanging open on several occasions. As a director, Eastwood is definitely on a losing streak.  ""True Crime"" is not as morbidly uninteresting as ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" was, but that's hardly the same as saying that it's worth watching.  I kept hoping that the formerly dirty Harry would finally get around to punching someone.  Maybe a team of screenwriters. There's bad language in ""True Crime,"" and the sight of a pregnant woman who's been shot in the neck.  I mean it when I say that the scariest moment is when Eastwood comes strolling out of the bathroom with his shirt off.  I'm not making fun of a person for aging (and I could only hope to have Eastwood's charisma when I'm 70), but maybe he needs to leave the girls to Woody Allen.  His supposed standing as a sex symbol never made sense.  Rated R.  127 minutes."
"Jul 19, 2014",POSITIVE," March 19, 1999 | Clint Eastwood once again demonstrates his master craftsmanship on both sides of the camera in True Crime, a beat-the-clock thriller with an edge of moral gravity. The movie generates a satisfying amount of suspense, but that is only part of its appeal. As usual, Eastwood directs with unhurried attentiveness to detail and unfashionable disregard for short attention spans.  At 68, he is one of the last of the Hollywood classicists, and the measured pace of his storytelling is perfectly suited to telling what is basically a character-driven story. Eastwood wisely cast himself as the character who does most of the driving: Steve Everett, a burnt-out newspaper reporter who reignites his passionate professionalism while his personal life short-circuits. Thanks to the intervention of a friendly editor-in-chief (James Woods in a profanely funny performance), Everett has landed a last-chance job at the Oakland Tribune. He has a loving wife -- apparently, the latest in a long line of unfortunate Mrs. Everetts -- and a lovely young daughter. He also has a roving eye and an overly active libido. When he can't interest a much younger colleague in an after-hours fling, he casually shifts gears and finds a more willing playmate -- who just happens to be the wife of his stiff-necked city editor (Denis Leary). But when the younger colleague dies in a car crash, Everett must handle his late co-worker's final assignment, an interview with a convicted killer who's scheduled for a lethal injection. Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) claims he was falsely accused of shooting a pregnant convenience-store clerk, and railroaded to Death Row.  Everett has heard -- and written -- this sort of story many times before. The big difference is, this time, he actually believes it. Trouble is, he has less than 12 hours to uncover enough exonerating evidence to win a stay of execution. Working from a smoothly efficient script adapted (by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff) from a novel Andrew Klavan, Eastwood propels True Crime along two parallel tracks, skillfully sustaining a sense of urgency by cutting back and forth between Beachum's long goodbye to his family before he walks the final mile, and Everett's increasingly frantic efforts to find something, anything, that might help save the convict's life. In the process, of course, the reporter also hopes to save himself, or least get a shot at redemption. Eastwood refuses to make things easy for the audience. He wants to rub our noses in the contradictions: Everett is ingratiating and insufferable, sincere and selfish, a dedicated seeker of truth and a ruthlessly amoral SOB. To illuminate all the aspects of this complex character, Eastwood gets a great deal of help from his favorite lead actor. Indeed, his performance is all the more impressive for his refusal to make Everett either conventionally likable or colorfully roguish. Rather, he plays the reporter as a deeply flawed scoundrel who is good enough at what he does to do good in spite of himself. Among the exceptional supporting players, Leary is atypically and effectively restrained, Washington is memorably poignant without obvious pleadings for sympathy, and Michael Jeter is intriguingly ambiguous as a witness who may very well believe he is telling his version of the truth. And James Woods steals every scene that isn't nailed down as the only man in Oakland who has even less shame than our tarnished anti-hero."

Since the surprise success of the 1994 Quentin Tarantino film, many films have tried to become ""the next Pulp Fiction.""  Films ranging from studio efforts like the 1996 MGM release 2 days in the Valley to the recent British indie import Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels have, in the name of achieving commercial success and cinematic ""cool,"" purloined at least one characteristic of that modern-day classic: the seedy underworld milieu, quirky canvases of characters played by large ensemble casts, twisty plot threads linking these characters, ""hip"" dialogue heavy with pop culture references, and--above all else--ultraviolence.  More often than not, though, the films end up not so much cool but cold--as in dead (on arrival).
With its large cast, crime world setting, and timeline-overlapping storylines, Go, written by first-timer John August and directed by Doug Liman (who created a different brand of cinematic ""cool"" with 1996's Swingers), could not tempt failure more dangerously.  Yet of all the Pulp knockoffs I've seen, this is the first that truly understands and captures what made that film such a triumph.  It wasn't the casting (though that definitely helped); it certainly wasn't the violence; nor was it the snappy dialogue of Tarantino and Roger Avary's Oscar-winning script--at least not that aspect of the screenplay, anyway.
The elusive quality in question is the element of realistic surprise.  Go spans one eventful 24-hour span, during which the life paths of Ronna (Sarah Polley), a teenage supermarket clerk who tries her hand at drug dealing; Ronna's British co-worker Simon (Desmond Askew); and friends Adam and Zack (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) constantly crisscross through Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  While following these three threads, August and Liman find unpredictable yet completely plausible ways to link the stories and take them in their own wild, roller coaster-like directions--without ever falling into the cheap trap of gratuitous violence.  To say anymore would be to rob the viewer of this film's greatest delight: that of discovery.
Not too far behind is the August's sharp sense of humor (suffice it to say, his hilarious dialogue and original comic situations do have snap) and the sterling ensemble.  Everyone does a standout job, but especially noteworthy are Polley, so good in Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter, who takes a surefooted step toward the mainstream; Askew, a newcomer to this side of the Atlantic; creepy William Fichtner, playing a cop with a hidden agenda; and Katie Holmes and Taye Diggs shine in more secondary roles.  Not to be ignored, though, are the efforts of Liman.  He shows a disarming visual flair never hinted at in Swingers (which was more of a script-dependent movie than a director-dependent one), and it is his guiding voice that assembles the numerous parts into a finely calibrated thrill machine.
Because of its largely youthful cast, Go is in danger of being--and, in fact, already has been, to some extent--pigeonholed as a ""teen Pulp Fiction,"" and given the films' similarities, that title is not entirely undeserved.  But Go deserves a more favorable comparison.  While not in the same league as its precursor, what August and Liman have done is use Pulp basics to create a film that is, by its own merits, a fiercely original and exhilarating entertainment.

Robert Altman's most fun movie since 1992's The Player is this wickedly enjoyable dark comedy--which, any way you slice it, is one steaming slab of Southern-fried soap.  Among those populating the small town of Holly Springs are scheming spinster Camille (Glenn Close); her spineless, half-wit sister Cora (Julianne Moore); Cora's rebellious daughter Emma (Liv Tyler), who is carrying on with another half-wit, sheriff's deputy Jason (Chris O'Donnell); Camille and Cora's octogenarian aunt Cookie (Patricia Neal); and Cookie's only friend, ever-faithful handyman Willis (Charles S. Dutton).  As in any soap, this family has more than its share of scandalous secrets--which gradually break through the surface when one of these people turns up dead.
But unlike any soap, there is an uncommon richness of character in Anne Rapp's script, which carves out memorable niches for even the most peripheral of characters, such as a sheriff's department receptionist (Niecy Nash) with the hots for a suave investigator (Courtney B. Vance).  Rapp, Altman, and the well-cast acting ensemble are fully aware of the preposterousness of the twisted goings-on.  What isn't preposterous, though, is the craft behind the whole affair, from the precision of Altman's direction to the uniformly fine work by the acting ensemble, whose standouts are the terrific Dutton and Close, the latter displaying a comic gift too rarely seen onscreen.

Doug Funnie (voice of Thomas McHugh), the 12-year-old star of Jim Jinkins's ABC and Nickelodeon animated series Doug, indeed has his first film, but if there's to be a second, he'd best find a vehicle more interesting to flesh-and-blood moviegoers over his age.  As it is, Doug's 1st Movie, in which Doug and his friend Skeeter (Fred Newman) befriend a gentle monster from a polluted lake, is a suitable entertainment for its target audience.  It's simple, good-natured, and tackles an environmental theme with an admirable lack of preachiness.  That said, for adults, the film is pleasant but hopelessly vanilla.  While the film will hush up the kids for its lean 77 minutes, but the older ones in the audience (read: parents) will find their attention wandering elsewhere.  Still, families can do worse for a night at the movies...
...such as Warner Bros.'s curious animated version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's venerable musical The King and I.  Since animation is the only medium in which the movie musical is still alive and kicking, using the form to adapt a successful stage production is a natural and undeniably intriguing extension.  Plus, there is no need to worry about coming up with snappy tunes when there is a tried-and-true score at one's disposal.  (And, indeed, the classic songs ""I Have Dreamed"" and ""Shall We Dance?"" are a pleasure to hear in this film, as they would in any setting.)
Yet this King and I is the most stupefyingly incompetent animated feature to reach the big screen in recent memory--even worse than Warner's misfire of last year, Quest for Camelot.   Like Quest, King features some ragged, Saturday morning-level artwork and animation (granted, so does Doug's 1st Movie, but at least there it's more or less intentional) and some clumsily integrated (to say the least) computer-generated effects.  But while I can see how the flighty Quest could divert the young ones in the audience, King is a film with no clear audience.
The story is still basically the same: sometime in the 19th century, British teacher Anna Leonowens (spoken by Miranda Richardson, sung by Christiane Noll) develops a warm friendship with the initially icy King of Siam (Martin Vidnovic) while tutoring his many children.  But, in accordance with the Disney mold, director Richard Rich has given the tale more kid-friendly trappings.  Toning down the material is not necessarily a bad thing--witness Disney's triumphant, underappreciated The Hunchback of Notre Dame--but here the material is dumbed down; the addition of cuddly animal companions, portly comic sidekicks, a sorcery-using villain, and a ridiculous action climax simply distract and never feel like necessary and natural outgrowths of the source story.  (Hunchback's wisecracking gargoyle device didn't always work, but for the most part, it was convincingly handled--as possibly being a figment of Quasimodo's imagination.)  Hence, adults who are engaged by the basic story and the music will likely be annoyed by the obligatory kiddie concessions.
But what about these kids, for whom the alterations were made?  The broad comedy garnered some giggles from the children in my audience, but most of the time I heard a lot of murmuring, some whining, and I felt a general sense of antsiness.  This is because the story of Anna and the King, while all-ages-appropriate, is a mature, subtly cerebral one.  And the lushly orchestrated Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes, while timeless standards, aren't exactly of the bouncy, ""Hakuna Matata""-like jingle type that leaves kids humming on the way out of the theatre.
Animating any traditional Broadway musical makes for an intriguing experiment, and indeed The King and I is one--albeit in the wrong, train wreck-like sort of way.  Based on this disastrous result, one can only hope that Warner Bros., which holds the feature film rights to Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, doesn't decide to sidestep the casting controversy and opt to go the animated route.

Since animation is the only medium in which the movie musical is still alive and kicking, using the form to adapt a successful stage production is a natural and undeniably intriguing extension.  Plus, there is no need to worry about coming up with snappy tunes when there is a tried-and-true score at one's disposal.  (And, indeed, the classic songs ""I Have Dreamed"" and ""Shall We Dance?"" are a pleasure to hear in this film, as they would in any setting.)
Yet this King and I is the most stupefyingly incompetent animated feature to reach the big screen in recent memory--even worse than Warner's misfire of last year, Quest for Camelot.   Like Quest, King features some ragged, Saturday morning-level artwork and animation (granted, so does Doug's 1st Movie, but at least there it's more or less intentional) and some clumsily integrated (to say the least) computer-generated effects.  But while I can see how the flighty Quest could divert the young ones in the audience, King is a film with no clear audience.
The story is still basically the same: sometime in the 19th century, British teacher Anna Leonowens (spoken by Miranda Richardson, sung by Christiane Noll) develops a warm friendship with the initially icy King of Siam (Martin Vidnovic) while tutoring his many children.  But, in accordance with the Disney mold, director Richard Rich has given the tale more kid-friendly trappings.  Toning down the material is not necessarily a bad thing--witness Disney's triumphant, underappreciated The Hunchback of Notre Dame--but here the material is dumbed down; the addition of cuddly animal companions, portly comic sidekicks, a sorcery-using villain, and a ridiculous action climax simply distract and never feel like necessary and natural outgrowths of the source story.  (Hunchback's wisecracking gargoyle device didn't always work, but for the most part, it was convincingly handled--as possibly being a figment of Quasimodo's imagination.)  Hence, adults who are engaged by the basic story and the music will likely be annoyed by the obligatory kiddie concessions.
But what about these kids, for whom the alterations were made?  The broad comedy garnered some giggles from the children in my audience, but most of the time I heard a lot of murmuring, some whining, and I felt a general sense of antsiness.  This is because the story of Anna and the King, while all-ages-appropriate, is a mature, subtly cerebral one.  And the lushly orchestrated Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes, while timeless standards, aren't exactly of the bouncy, ""Hakuna Matata""-like jingle type that leaves kids humming on the way out of the theatre.
Animating any traditional Broadway musical makes for an intriguing experiment, and indeed The King and I is one--albeit in the wrong, train wreck-like sort of way.  Based on this disastrous result, one can only hope that Warner Bros., which holds the feature film rights to Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, doesn't decide to sidestep the casting controversy and opt to go the animated route.

Much like how his character, Ed Pekurny, finds fame as the subject of a 24-hour ""reality"" cable network, Matthew McConaughey should find his falling star back on the rise as the lead in EDtv, Ron Howard's amiable goof of a comedy.  McConaughey is a charismatic charmer as Ed, a Texas-to-San Francisco transplant whose life becomes fodder for the TV-viewing masses, but unlike Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's similarly-themed (and far superior) The Truman Show, Ed is fully aware of the cameras.  But as with Truman, Ed, while initially intrigued with the notion of having all eyes on him, comes to yearn for freedom, especially after it creates strain between and his girlfriend Shari (Jenna Elfman)--who, as it happens, is the ex of Ed's wilder older brother Ray (Woody Harrelson).
Howard and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel don't have the high satirical aims of Truman's Weir and writer Andrew Niccol; they simply aim to entertain.  And after a tentative start, EDtv picks up comedic steam and does just that, amusingly exploring the ramifications of Ed's sudden, if largely unmerited, celebrity, from opportunistic groupies (Elizabeth Hurley's sizzling model/aspiring actress) to the diminished privacy of his colorful family.  Harrelson is predictably effective as a blowhard, and Elfman (Golden Globe winner for TV's Dharma and Greg) shows major promise as a screen star, but the McConaughey magnetism is so overwheming that the film could easily have been called MATTtv.

Fraternal writing-directing duo Larry and Andy Wachowski put themselves in a similar situation with their 1996 debut Bound.  In that revelatory film, they took the unpromising, tin foil-level pairing of Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon as larcenous lesbian lovers and turned into cinematic gold--no less than one of the best films of that year.  And with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have once again achieved such a feat of alchemy, blending these modest parts into a stunning whole that really has no business working as brilliantly as it does.
Reeves's blank demeanor is a perfect fit for the often befuddled character of Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer who leads a second life in cyberspace under the name ""Neo.""  One night he is contacted by the enigmatic hacker Trinity (Moss) on behalf of the even more enigmatic Morpheus (Fishburne) regarding a mysterious concept that has been haunting him for ages--""the Matrix.""
None of this may make much sense in and of itself, but to go into more detail is the ruin one of the great pleasures of the film: that of discovery--that of the story's the secrets as the layers are gradually peeled away and of an entirely new world as imagined by the Wachowskis (and brought to spectacular visual life by special effects producer Matthew Ferro).  Once again, they have come up with a story that is smart, challenging, and completely unpredictable, and their direction is characterized by an uncommon attention to detail.  For example, the line deliveries by Hugo Weaving (who plays the sinister Agent Smith) initially strike one as laughably stiff, but it is eventually revealed to serve a purpose.
The Matrix is more than a head trip, however; the Wachowskis deliver the action goods and then some.  They are the first American filmmakers to successfully duplicate the wild abandon of the Hong Kong action style, from a number of exhilarating martial arts fight scenes (choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, director of such high-flying HK films as Iron Monkey and Wing Chun) to some of the best Woo knockoff shootouts one is likely to find anywhere.  As viscerally exciting as these passages are, what is especially impressive is how the Wachowskis come up with an underlying explanation for all the gravity-defying derring-do--something no Hong Kong filmmaker has ever bothered to do.
If this review has struck you as incredibly vague, perhaps maddeningly so, then I have done my job.  As Morpheus tells Neo, """"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.""  But I will say this much more: one of Morpheus's repeated urgings is to Neo is, ""Open your mind,"" and while watching The Matrix the audience would be wise to heed that advice.  Fortunately for all of us, the Wachowski Brothers already have--and the visionary products of their unbridled imaginations are free for everyone to experience.

Yet not only do we swallow all this, we eat it up.  And that's because of the considerable talents of Barrymore.  As I mentioned, it's a stretch to have this glam gal play a dork.  But the gifted Barrymore is up to the task as Josie Geller, a lonely 25-year-old copy editor at the Chicago Sun-Times whose first job as a reporter is to go undercover in a high school and find a story.  Not only does this present Josie with the opportunity to pursue her dream career but a chance to erase her miserable memories of high school, where her less-than-popular ways earned her unflattering nickname of ""Josie Grossie.""  It's hard to imagine Barrymore being remotely considered gross, but she entirely convinces in both the flashback scenes where she sports stringy brown hair, pimply makeup, and braces; and as the better-groomed but still frumpy--with the attitude to match--Josie.  The character's nerdiness also gives Barrymore the chance to display a heretofore unseen flair for light physical comedy.
The script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein is nothing if not formulaic.  In addition to the predictable touchstones of Josie's predictable personal and professional redemption, the wacky younger sibling (Arquette's Rob), and the nerdy student (Leelee Sobieski) with whom Josie identifies while undercover, there's also her dream of finding romance with a guy--or, at the very least, a ""real"" kiss (hence the film's title).  When young, intelligent literature teacher Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan) enters the scene, there's no mistaking how everything will eventually turn out.  But by the film's climax, I was surprised at how invested I was in Josie and her dream, due in no small part to Barrymore's natural rapport with the audience.  So likable is she that we're willing to overlook the somewhat discomfiting fact that Sam would be attracted to someone he believes to be his student.
But Barrymore is not the only person onscreen who makes an impression; there are some colorful supporting performances by Arquette (even if he in no way looks like he could be younger than Barrymore), Molly Shannon (as Josie's libidinous co-worker), and John C. Reilly (as Josie's boss).  That said, there is no doubt that Never Been Kissed belongs to Barrymore and that if it weren't for her delightful presence, the film would not be, to paraphrase the tagline, ""a thing worth waiting for.""

The new Mod Squad is a study in how a surefire idea gets botched in the execution.  The premise of having a group of three young ex-crooks--Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Linc Hayes (Omar Epps), and Pete Cochrane (Giovanni Ribisi)--do undercover police work is a concept ripe for updating.  But any high hopes are just about immediately let down, then wiped out completely in one early scene where the three talk in a car.  Sounds simple enough, but Danes, Epps, and Ribisi show no group chemistry whatsoever.  Some squad this is--and for reasons known only to Silver and co-writers Stephen Kay and Kate Lanier, they spend most of the film in individual plot threads.
Individually, though, these actors have problems of their own.  Danes is a good enough sport, but she appears somewhat ill-at-ease in this, her first popcorn movie.  Ribisi's Pete is only slightly more intelligent than his character in The Other Sisters portrayal is every bit as grating.  The only one who appears the slightest bit in place is Epps, but he literally runs through the film.  In fact, those running scenes are all that in-over-his-head director Scott Silver (whose only other film was the low-budget indie drama johns) tries to pass off as action in this talky, terrible film.  After the one-two failed franchise punch of this and The Rage: Carrie 2, MGM is once again left to wait for James Bond to rescue them with his next, certain-to-be-a-blockbuster adventure, due in November.

However, there is one overlying thing that the films have in common: in both, Stein is aping the voice of other, better directors.  While he channelled Heathers's Michael Lehmann and Clueless's Amy Heckerling in Jawbreaker, in Sparkler, Stein goes after the demented vibe of John Waters. Our white trash main character travels from Victorville, California to Las Vegas to find a trio of young men (Freddie Prinze Jr., Jamie Kennedy, and Steven Petrarca) she met by chance at a local bar.  Along the way, she and the audience encounters such Waters-esque touches as underground strip clubs and a butch lesbian wearing a T-shirt reading ""PUSSYWHIPPED.""  The difference there isn't enough energy to the direction to hide the fact that there is really no plot, just some loosely strung-together of individual events; nor is there enough to make anything barely cross the ""amusing"" mark. 
Also relatable are Kat's reasons for lashing out; the characters that surround her are so vacuous, it's completely understandable why she wouldn't want to associate with them.  These people include, in addition to Bianca, her shallow best friend Chastity (Gabrielle Union); Bianca's two suitors, egotistical model/actor Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) and dull nice guy Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt); Cameron's geeky friend Michael Eckman (David Krumholtz); and, to a certain extent, the guy who eventually thaws our ice princess, mysterious loner Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger, who actually has some nice chemistry with Stiles).  They're all nice, selfish targets for the full concentration of Kat's venom.  The problem is, while director Gil Junger and writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith often let Kat bare her fangs, she is given little to no opportunity to actually bite.  Though this is a reworking of The Taming of the Shrew, the scale is too heavily tilted toward the ""taming"" and not the ""shrew.""  Anyone looking for the wickedness promised by the film's title or its taglines (""How do I loathe thee?  Let me count the ways"" and ""Romeo, oh Romeo, get out of my face"") will instead find a light dose of bile and a strong one of the warm fuzzies."
"Aug 7, 2008",NEUTRAL,
"Aug 5, 2007",POSITIVE," Is Clint Eastwood about ready to retire? His Oscar-winning Unforgiven was, to these eyes, a pristine work of art and entertainment; but that was also seven years ago, and since then, also to these eyes, he has been sliding and coasting. The overlong and finally mawkish A Perfect World, the decent but unnecessary Bridges of Madison County, the mundane Absolute Power, the too-leisurely Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil …. These are films for grown-ups, with a contemplative pace to match, and regardless of their flaws, they are honorable and rock-solid pieces of craftsmanship — hardly an inelegant moment in them. What they aren’t is exciting. Bidding farewell to his sixties, Eastwood has become an almost stubbornly tame director, as if atoning for the bad taste of his box-office reign as Dirty Harry. Eastwood’s new one as director-star, True Crime, isn’t nearly as phlegmatic as his last couple of efforts. Taking his cameras into the offices of a fictional Oakland newspaper, Clint gets a little buzz going, especially when he puts James Woods (the editor in chief) and Denis Leary (news editor) in the same room. When Clint, as chewed-up warhorse reporter Steve Everett, joins them in the room, we forget whatever the movie’s supposed to be about. Woods is at his withering best; Leary, perhaps feeling outgunned, reins himself in and plays his editor as borderline mild-mannered — the novelty of that is almost as much fun to watch as Leary’s usual ranting. I’ll always remember Clint inviting Denis Leary to punch him in the face — it’s one of those nice moments for fans of both actors — but I’ve already forgotten most of the material that’s supposed to be the plot’s main motor. And what’s that? Oh, the usual beat-the-clock scenario. Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington) is on death row, scheduled for execution in 12 hours, and he might be innocent of the murder he was convicted for. Everett, with his “nose” for news and his need to do something good with his life (he’s just about womanized his way out of his marriage), digs around and tries to find evidence that someone else, not Frank, pulled the trigger on a pregnant cashier clerk. That isn’t really what True Crime is about, though. Clint Eastwood will be 70 next year, and he has a little daughter (Francesca Fisher-Eastwood, who appears in the movie as Everett’s daughter) young enough to be his great-granddaughter. A scene in which Everett gives his little girl a “speed zoo” trip — rushing her through the zoo because he’s on a deadline — is touching for reasons that have nothing to do with the plot. And we see the condemned Frank Beachum saying a long goodbye to his own daughter. The movie is about the pain of fathers who won’t live to see their little girls grow up, and who, whether because of jail or work, can’t spend what little time they have left with their daughters. Once I picked up on that, the plot didn’t get less routine, but everything around it got more telling. Everett, we see, fools around with much younger women out of fear of his own mortality (is that also why Clint has traditionally done likewise?). Meanwhile, the story drifts away, and the movie is structured in a conventional way that lets us know it won’t end tragically (as, say, A Perfect World did). There are no surprises — no Primal Fear revelation, no defeatist ending in which Everett’s efforts come to naught. (Some may register a bit of surprise that the former Dirty Harry now comes down, in effect, against capital punishment.) What keeps the movie alive is its subtext. It’s always interesting to read between the lines of Eastwood’s recent movies and see what’s really on his mind, but I wish he’d be a little more picky about his material."

"Feb 28, 2002",POSITIVE," Trusting one's intuition means seeing from the belly, as practitioners of Eastern religions put it. Most of us, however, have a hard time hearing this sacred inner voice in the din of directions and opinions all around us. ""The more faithfully you listen to the voice within you,"" Dag Hammarskjold once noted, ""the better you will hear what is sounding outside."" True Crime presents a riveting and deeply moral drama about a thoughtless and irresponsible man whose only saving grace is his catlike intuition. Steve Everett (Clint Eastwood) is an over-the-hill recovering alcoholic reporter for the Oakland Tribune who relishes the role of nonconformist. He's never played by the rules, and, not surprisingly, his career is in shambles. When Michele (Mary McCormack), a young colleague, dies in a car wreck, Bob (Denis Leary), the paper's assignment editor, orders Everett to finish a story she was working on. It is a human interest piece to be based on an interview that afternoon with Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), a black man scheduled to be executed that night by lethal injection at San Quentin for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk six years ago. As he looks into the court records and other stories on the case, the reporter's ""nose"" or intuition tells him that Beachum is innocent. Meeting the doomed man and his devoted wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton), he becomes more convinced that the truth of the crime has not been discovered. Racing against the clock, he sees this story as his last chance to redeem his own sad and sorry life. The psychologically nuanced screenplay by Larry Gross, Paul Brickman, and Steven Schiff vividly conveys Everett's desperate struggle to stay true to his intuition when all the other voices are blasting away at his soul. His wife Barbara (Diana Venora) can't forgive his constant womanizing and wants a divorce; Bob is enraged at him for having slept with his wife; and Alan Mann (James Woods), editor of the paper, is reluctant to stick his neck out for a ""smarmy"" rebel who seems to revel in self-destruction. Everett's no hero; he throws himself at younger women, is careless about his child's safety, and slips off the wagon at the end of a bad day. But nobody can ever be counted out. True Crime proves once again that Clint Eastwood is a formidable actor and director whose movies are consistently engaging and edifying."
"Feb 27, 2001",NEUTRAL," As long as there are movies, there will be remakes, and no movie is exempt from a future retooling, warranted or otherwise. There have been good remakes and bad ones, needed ones and unnecessary ones. There is nothing inherently wrong with remakes'many notable directors have remade their own films, including Alfred Hitchcock, Yasujiro Ozu, and John Ford, to name a few'although they always bear the weight of comparison with 'the original,' which is often erroneously though better simply for having been around longer.

"Jan 1, 2000",NEGATIVE," Clint is at it again. Imperfect reporter (i.e.:
              ex-drunk, current womanizer, unable to feel
              compassion) has nose for the truth. When the
              newswoman assigned to a ""human interest"" death row
              case dies before the convict -- Clint and his hunch
              are given less than 24 hours to pick up the pieces
              and free the wrongly accused man (Isaiah Washington).
              Can it be done? This is the old gritty Clint -- the ""Do you feel
              lucky punk?"" Clint. Extra camera time is given to
              cigarette lighting and snuffing to remind you that
              this is the tough Eastwood of yesteryear. I was liking it, then it was getting boring, then
              it got exciting and interesting and even got me all
              choked up. Then, in a last minute ditch effort to
              save a life, a completely inebriated Eastwood walks
              his red nose into the bar door on his way out, drives
              as fast as he can on a rainy night (with an innocent
              passenger), pulls his emergency brake on a
              particularly dangerous piece of road in order to set
              two trailing squad cars spinning (Dukes-of-Hazard
              style). I mean, I'm there routing for him to save the
              death row guy -- but come on, not at the expense of
              whacking a couple of officers, and a jogger in his
              drunken stupor. Oh, and James Woods is absolutely wonderful as
              Eastwood's Chief Editor. He plays the same hardball,
              yet light-hearted, lovable character that he played
              in ""Hercules"" the animated feature."

"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," Clint Eastwood's ""True Crime'' follows the rhythm of a newspaperman's day. For those who cover breaking news, many days are about the same. When they begin, time seems to stretch out generously toward the deadline. There's leisure for coffee and phone calls, jokes and arguments. Then a blip appears on the radar screen: an assignment. Seemingly a simple assignment. Then the assignment reveals itself as more complicated. The reporter makes some calls. If there's anything to the story at all, a moment arrives when it becomes, to the reporter, the most important story in the world. His mind shapes the form it should take. He badgers sources for the missing pieces. The deadline approaches, his attention focuses, the finish line is the only thing visible, and then facts, story, deadline and satisfaction come all at the same time. A deadline reporter's day, in other words, is a lot like sex. Eastwood uses this rhythm to make ""True Crime'' into a wickedly effective thriller. He plays Steve Everett, a reporter for the Oakland Tribune. Steve used to work out East, but got fired for ""screwing the owner's under-age daughter.'' The movie's Web page says he worked for the New York Times, but this detail has been dropped from the movie, no doubt when the information about the owner's daughter was added. Now he's having an affair with the wife of Findley, his city editor (Denis Leary). Everett's personal life is a mess. His wife, Barbara (Diane Venora) knew he cheated when she married him, but thought it was only with her. Now they have a young daughter, but Everett seems too busy to be a good dad (there's a scene where he pushes her stroller through the zoo at a dead run). Everett's also a little shaky; he was a drunk until two months ago, when he graduated to recovering alcoholic. He's assigned to write a routine story about the last hours of a man on Death Row: Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), convicted of the shooting death of a pregnant clerk in a convenience store. Both the city editor and the editor-in-chief (James Woods) know Everett is a hotshot with a habit of turning routine stories into federal cases, and they warn him against trying to save Beachum at the 11th hour. But it's in Everett's blood to sniff out the story behind the story. He becomes convinced the wrong man is going to be executed. ""When my nose tells me something stinks--I gotta have faith in it,'' he tells Beachum. This is Eastwood's 21st film as a director and experience has given him patience. He knows that even in a deadline story like this, not all scenes have to have the same breakneck pace. He doesn't direct like a child of MTV, for whom every moment has to vibrate to the same beat. Eastwood knows about story arc, and as a jazz fan, he also knows about improvising a little before returning to the main theme. ""True Crime'' has a nice rhythm, intercutting the character's problems at home, his interviews with the prisoner, his lunch with a witness, his unsettling encounter with the grandmother of another witness. And then, as the midnight hour of execution draws closer, Eastwood tightens the noose of inexorably mounting tension. There are scenes involving an obnoxious prison chaplain and a basically gentle warden, and the mechanical details of execution. Cuts to the governor who can stay the execution. Tests of the telephone hotlines. Battles with Everett's editors. Last-minute revelations. Like a good pitcher, Eastwood gives the movie a nice slow curve and a fast break. Many recent thrillers are so concerned with technology that the human characters are almost in the way. We get gun battles and car chases that we don't care about, because we don't know the people firing the guns or driving the cars. I liked the way Eastwood and his writers (Larry Gross, Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff) lovingly added the small details. For example, the relationships that both the reporter and the condemned man have with their daughters. And a problem when the prisoner's little girl can't find the right color crayon for her drawing of green pastures. In England 25 years ago, traditional beer was being pushed off the market by a pasteurized product that had been pumped full of carbonation (in other words, by American beer). A man named Richard Boston started the Real Beer Campaign. Maybe it's time for a movement in favor of Real Movies. Movies with tempo and character details and style, instead of actionfests with Attention Deficit Syndrome. Clint Eastwood could be honorary chairman. Roger Ebert was the film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, he won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism."
"Jan 1, 2000",NEGATIVE," You remember, the film-within-a-film of the Hollywood satire The Player? Habeus Corpus began its life as an honest look at the harsh realities of capital punishment — the innocent white woman accused of murder would be wrongfully executed because “that happens” — with real actors instead of movie stars, and ends up a piece of Hollywood hokum with Bruce Willis rescuing Julia Roberts from the gas chamber at the last possible moment. When she beatifically asks what took him so long, he replies with his snarky grin, “Traffic was a bitch.”
It’s hard to know what’s most offensive about True Crime. The undisguised misogyny? The ridiculous plot? The over-the-top performances from actors who should know better? The lack of a single character who isn’t a stereotype? Or the fact that the same man, Clint Eastwood, who made the subtle and original Unforgiven is also responsible for this claptrap? Director Eastwood and his screenwriter Larry Gross use the biggest sledgehammer imaginable to point out to us that maybe capital punishment is not such a good idea. On the eve of the execution of Frank Beachum (Out of Sight‘s Isaiah Washington), a reporter who was investigating what she believed to be his wrongful conviction is killed in a car wreck. The next morning, self-admitted “scumbag” Steve Everett (Eastwood) — recovering alcoholic, serial womanizer, and burned-out reporter — is handed the job of writing a human-interest piece on the execution. With mere hours to go, he instead picks up where his colleague left off, determined that Beachum is innocent and hellfire bent on proving it. I could go on and on. I can’t remember the last time I saw a movie quite so distasteful, or quite so boring. By the time the credits rolled, I wanted to shoot myself… No, wait, I wanted to shoot Eastwood. I did, in fact, allow myself a good scream of rage once I was outside the theater."

"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," Like many recent Ritchie movies, this one has a lot of frenetic action, a fair amount of spectacle, some cheeky dialogue, and a hefty dose of machismo. Designed to be corny and loopy but with a kernel of sentimentality at its core, and is sufficiently different to make it almost worth seeing for that reason alone. ""Civil War"" does a good job dissecting the damage done by a desensitization to violence but it botches the backstory and features an ending that belongs in another movie. The actors do what they can with underwritten roles but it is hard not to see that a lot more could have been developed from the premise. For those who have an orgasmic reaction to kaiju confrontations, far too little of the film is devoted to them and the overreliance on CGI leeches away the awe associated with the spectacle. It is at times unsettling and the ending contains a strong shock element but the movie as a whole feels a little too familiar to engage its audience."

"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," Like so many of the flawed gems in the Clint Eastwood oeuvre, True Crime manages to underscore both the virtues that have earned him recognition as a major director and the limitations that consign him, for the most part, to a position just a cut or two below the first rank. As one of the last of the old-school auteurs, Eastwood has a clear, consistent idea of what he wants to say with his films, so there's not much danger of mistaking his work for anyone else's. True Crime, which strikes me as his best work since 1992's Unforgiven, contains many of Eastwood's trademarks, including the definitive one: a morally ambiguous, emotionally scarred protagonist getting one last shot at redemption after a spectacular fall from grace. In this case, the rehabbing hero is Steve Everett, a one-time star investigative reporter trying to revive a career he's trashed with booze, satyriasis, and inordinate faith in his gut instincts. When one of Steve's colleagues dies in a car accident, his editor (Leary) assigns him to finish the story the recently deceased was working on: an interview with a San Quentin inmate (Washington) who's about to be executed for murdering a pregnant grocery cashier. Almost immediately, though, Everett starts smelling rats in the wall of evidence, and his original story angle (born-again thug finds peace and salvation through Jesus) becomes a crusade to free a man he believes to be innocent. From this point, the familiar race-against-the-executioner's-clock plot is set in motion, with all the usual accouterments of skeptical bosses, uncooperative lawmen, and the inevitable key witness who has mysteriously dropped out of sight. Eastwood, seldom one for narrative innovation or high-style shotmaking, shows little interest in subverting our expectations. Instead, he places absolute trust in his genius for moving us with sharp, forceful, linear storytelling and his ability to coax memorable, full-bodied performances from his idiosyncratic supporting cast. Woods' turn as an executive editor with a wary reverence for Steve's mercurial talent includes some of his best work ever. Leary is almost as good playing against type as a cuckolded yuppie city editor. True Crime suffers, like many of Eastwood's films, from the director's obsession with symmetry -- an abhorrence of loose ends and unresolved conflicts that give the conclusion a somewhat mechanistic feel. One also wishes, on behalf of millions of female viewers who could probably do without any further exposure to 68-year-old Clint's Inca-mummy physique, that hunk emeritus Eastwood would officially close the book on the shirtless-scene phase of his career. But even conceding the weaknesses that often seem to flow from the very same instincts that lend his work its clarity and power, True Crime still seems likely to hold up as one of the year's better crime dramas. When Eastwood is at the top of his form -- as he is for much of this film -- there's no more spellbinding storyteller in American cinema.
