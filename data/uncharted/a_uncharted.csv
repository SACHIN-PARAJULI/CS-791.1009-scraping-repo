"Apr 11, 2024",NEGATIVE,"They just ruined one of the greatest video game. 
Awful casting and i feel just like watching Spider man"
"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,it's a good adventure movie with a classic adventure movie plot. The action scenes are well done and recall the video game saga of the same name. The film itself has good CGI. But a little inconsistent with the history of video games since this is a prequel to the first game.
"Mar 29, 2024",NEUTRAL,It was an entertaining movie to watch.
"Mar 28, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Decente película, buena, pero que podría haber sido mejor a mi parecer. Esta cinta se basa en los videojuegos del mismo nombre, los cuales tienen una gran calidad en general, por lo que esta cinta podría haber sido igual si tomaban muchas mas cosas de ellos. Su principal error es su titulo, ya que no encuentro nada de ""Uncharted"" en esta película, solo los nombres de los personajes. La historia podría ser cualquiera de aventura y listo, tiene bastantes conveniencias y entretiene bastante eso si, pero no encuentro un parecido con los juegos salvo algunas referencias en pocas escenas. Mi principal problema con esto es el cast, el cual no me gusto ya que sigo sin ver a Tom Holland como Nathan, a pesar de que se mueve muy bien en escenas de acción o persecución, pero tiene momentos que parece que hace el papel de siempre con chistes tontos con los que no conecto. Por otro lado, Mark Wahlberg como Sully tampoco me convenció, aunque me gusto un poquito mas, pero lo veo mas como Nathan que como Sully, y no me gusta que no le hayan puesto su bigote característico. Además, parece que se quieren alejar del aspecto de los personajes en los juegos pero Chloe se asemeja bastante a la vista en los juegos, por lo que no se que quisieron hacer. Por otro lados, los villanos son bastante malos y olvidables, Antonio Banderas a mi parecer tenia bastante potencial y podían hacer un villano brutal con el, pero no lo aprovecharon y se vuelve un villano mas que tiene rencor con su padre; y Braddock también me parece una villana algo sosa y sin carisma. Los efectos me parecen algo malos, ya que hay escenas que se nota bastante la pantalla verde, y algún que otro efecto como el fuego que a veces se ve mal; solo destaco algunas escenas como la del avión que a pesar de la pantalla verde algo notoria, no se ve para nada mal a mi parecer. La banda sonora me parece que cumple, el uso del tema original me pareció excelente y me hubiera gustado que lo hayan implementado mas. Por ultimo, destaco lo visto al final de la cinta, que hace que tenga algo de esperanza con el futuro de esta franquicia si la saben aprovechar y darle mas esencia a los personajes. En conclusión, una cinta decente a mi parecer, que entretiene bastante y si no conoces los juegos te va a resultar bastante buena, pero en mi caso no logro conectar del todo con los personajes y sigo sin notar la esencia de los mismos Nate y Sully que vi por primera vez en la Playstation; sin embargo, creo que no esta tan mal y a pesar de que su historia tenga algunas cosas sin sentido, logra contar algo divertido y con un futuro que podría ser prometedor. La recomiendo."
"Mar 25, 2024",NEGATIVE,"The film wasn't that bad in itself and the actors did their best, resulting in a thoroughly watchable flick. The problem was the footsteps of the previous computer games. The Uncharted series manages to inspire a curiosity for history and mythological treasure hunts that you only remember from childhood. The characters were distinctive and, in addition to their oneliners, had well-developed and realistic character traits that evolved over the games. All of this was what made the Uncharted title so special and unfortunately the film lacks all of this. The film takes a few snippets from the original, but turns them into an incomprehensible and disjointed patchwork that is held together by the action scenes and occasional humour. It's more as if the writers picked out some big name, watched a forced video summary and mistakenly thought to themselves: I can write that story better."
"Mar 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Fun, pacy not too serious. Worth trying out. Tom Holland impressive"
"Mar 17, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not bad overall. As a huge Tom Holland fan, I loved seeing him in this. But parts of it just felt like lazy writing, while it also felt quickly paced, yet this was 2hrs. It paced quick, but in a slow way. But still a good film overall."
"Mar 15, 2024",NEUTRAL,As a fan of the game series this movie is alright for people that have never played the games the movie is a nice indiana jones / mission inpossible genre but misses the aspect of curiosity somethimes overall an okay movie but not really worth watching twice as a game fan i did not like the movie due to the fact that charackters meet differently and some points do not make any sense also messing up 2 games in one movie to make at the end their own original plot kinda ruined the movie for me .
"Mar 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,A very typical action treasure hunting movie.

Minha opinião: Mais um filme de caça ao tesouro, ao estilo Indiana Jones, Minas do Rei Salomão, A Cidade Perdida,.... Temos aqui o novo astro de Hollywood com um veteranao, Mark Wahlberg e outro veterano Antonio Banderas. Pena a forma da morte Santiago de forma tão fútil. E aforma que tentaram criar uma química entre Tom e Mark, e temos também o tempero que Chloe uma traidora e enganadora. Este filme tem haver com um jogo de vídeo game, eu nunca joguei, por isso não tenho como fazer uma compração. A estoria é de 2 irmãos que foram criados no orfanato, quando seu irmão mais velho foge e promete voltar, porem não volta. Até o dia que aparece Sullivan para contratar Drake para ir na busca do tesouro escondido. Mesmo relutando ele aceita e nesta corrida aparece mais uma pessoa que esta atrás do mapa Chloe. Então se junta, mas os bandidos que é Santiago e sua gang comandade por Braddock. Entre traições e pular de aviões, tem muita emoção, com CGI bem realizados. Até quando encontram o tesouro ao estilo de Goonies, mas aqui eles irão exageram mais com navios sendo guinchados por helicópteros. Até o ápice do final. Um filme com ação do inicio ao fim.
Roteiro e enredo bom. Mas existe uma diferença com sucessos como Indiana que sempre existiu uma equipe e quando alguém era colocado em perigo, exite aquela união para salvar.
Vale apena assistir? Sim
Nota: 8"
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Was an okay film, but wasn't fantastic. Better than many films in recent years, but still only a time passer, not something I would purposely watch again."
"Mar 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It was okay, not a masterpiece, but it wasn't bad. The film had its good parts, but some parts of the film was bad. I would watch it again, but not many times. 3/5"
"Mar 2, 2024",NEUTRAL,"As a stand alone film, its enjoyable, but over the top and extremely basic story line. With the amount of resources they had to make the film it should really be better"
"Feb 28, 2024",NEGATIVE,With such a great cast I sort of expected more of this movie. It could well be the lovechild of Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible. As with most movies the viewer has to suspend a certain amount of belief but helicopters racing while each carrying a galleon. Really?
"Feb 28, 2024",POSITIVE,"Loved it, great script! Great actors. Can't wait for the next one!!! Had a lot of action but not over done. Not foul. Makes you want to treasure hunt."
"Feb 26, 2024",POSITIVE,"Critics once again show their true colors. Fantastic popcorn movie, just like the games. Great acting by everyone involved. I hope there will be more to come!"
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Exactly what I thought it would be, Mark Wahlberg playing himself on an adventure.  It's pretty good. I would watch it again."
"Feb 25, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Put the popcorn on the table, turn your brains off and have fun..."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Doesn't fully stand on its own, I think you need more reference than just watching the movie in isolation based on the quality of the sincerity between the characters."
"Feb 24, 2024",NEGATIVE,Terribly cast. 20 year old immature  boy playing 40 year old character.
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the games, all I wanted was for this movie to be good. And I was happy with what I saw. Tom Holland is always a blast to watch, and as a young Nathan Drake he does quite well. Mark Wahlberg, while not really being anything like Sully from the games, was still very fun to watch. It has great stunt work, fun action, and a good sense of humor. If you're looking for an easy to watch adventure film, I'd recommend giving this one a watch!"
"Feb 24, 2024",POSITIVE,"Not the best adaptation ever made, but it provides a fun time. Solid performance by the cast."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"It's ok. Nothing really broken about it, just a turn your brain off popcorn flick. But nothing is really that consistently good either. No one really has much chemistry in this. Sometimes it can come off a bit wooden at times and Banderas is only in it half the film replaced by a generic villian. The humor falls flat most of the time and is very Marvel like landing a chuckle here and there. Lots of over the top action scenes heavy on CGI but doesn't look half bad. The problem is this is shot very basic and lots of times it's very dark and dull to look at. The Papa John's fight was stupid. The plot from a birds eye view makes sense and I was able to follow it but it suprisingly got very convuluted at points as they made there way from one clue to the next clue. I don't get why Sam was included in this either as outside of the opening 5 minutes he never is really part of the plot except writing letters. This needed stronger direction in general as nothing really pops and the acting isn't anything special to save it. In addition the script needed to be more straigh forward as well as it alternates between over the top action scene to boring locale for the next clue which desite having lots of different locales I'm struggling to name one besides the ships at the end. Unless your a big fan of any actor in this, most people should skip this."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"Having watched ""Uncharted,"" I found it to be a bit of a mixed bag. While it had its moments of entertainment, particularly thanks to Tom Holland's charismatic performance, overall, it fell short of leaving a lasting impression. The storyline felt lacking in depth, and the action sequences, while decently executed, lacked originality and felt somewhat derivative. It seemed to rely heavily on clichés and failed to fully capture the essence of its source material. However, I can see how fans of action-adventure films, especially those familiar with the video game series, might still find it enjoyable as a passable diversion. Ultimately, ""Uncharted"" didn't quite live up to its potential, leaving me with a feeling of mild disappointment."
"Feb 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,Feels like an imitation of a movie (the beats are all kind of there but none of them have any emotional weight) and every cast member is devoid of charisma or chemistry.
"Feb 20, 2024",NEGATIVE,"This was one of the most disappointing waste of time ever.
It's not about the cast or the script that are shitty for sure. It's about the lack of respect for ancient artifacts that this movie promote."
"Feb 20, 2024",NEUTRAL,Generic but still enjoyable and an easy watch when you're in the mood for something National Treasure-ish
"Feb 14, 2024",NEUTRAL,The plot might not be amazing but the action is good. Tom and Mark are a good fit for each other that I enjoyed. Recommend.
"Feb 11, 2024",POSITIVE,"Finally got around to seeing this after being scared off by the poor critic reviews. How silly of me, the movie was great! Fun, entertaining and exciting. Played all the games and a worthy addition to them. Think I will pay more notice of audience reviews from now on."
"Feb 10, 2024",NEGATIVE,"I watch not knowing it was Uncharted, i played Uncharted 4 and i cant see any bit of the game in this film, the extra principal actress was completely unnecessary, if they choose the original way and only put Tom and Sullivan as the principal caracters it would be great, theres a lot of things i dont like it about this movie, and i dont understand why the writers decide to change the story so much instead of making it so much far of the original and messing up everything. I wouldn't call this film a Uncharted movie."
"Feb 7, 2024",NEGATIVE,As a true gamer I was super excited with the announcement of this movie and the cast of this movie but instead of Using the amazing source material They instead try to make a giant spectacle movie that falls flat.
"Feb 6, 2024",NEGATIVE,"as a fan of the games, i hate that this movie exists"
"Feb 6, 2024",POSITIVE,"Indiana Jones meats Pirates of the Caribbean. Not an award winner, but plenty of action, some puzzles/mystery, very entertaining and fun!"
"Feb 3, 2024",NEGATIVE,Meh.  Mark Walberg is either the worst actor of all time or solid. He PRODUCED this movie so picked the director and was AWFUL. What meatheads say this movie is an 80% er?  Cause they're so wrong. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
"Jan 22, 2024",POSITIVE,"Thoroughly enjoyable action adventure movie, featuring a cast of likeable talent and two leads who really work well together. The story is good, and it is delivered well with a good partnership between cinematography and direction. The settings and aesthetic really work in favour of the overall story, and the elements of comedy and disbelief enhance it. I'd expected a mediocre, hammy, eye-roll-inducing viewing, but found it to be an enjoyable, entertaining watch, and one I'd watch again"
"Jan 21, 2024",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies ever made.  Forget suspending disbelief, you have to be brain dead to watch this.  In fact, I ought to sue the producers of this garbage for lowering my IQ because I watched it."
"Jan 20, 2024",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie. Acting is awesome, cgi is impeccable, the story is immaculate
 5/5"
"Jan 17, 2024",POSITIVE,"Ridiculously over the top, but entertaining."
"Jan 14, 2024",NEGATIVE,the physics behind picking up a ship? That's all i will say.
"Jan 14, 2024",POSITIVE,Very good movie loved the action scenes
"Jan 5, 2024",POSITIVE,I don't about the game Uncharted so... but I liked it beacause it made me WOW and great acting and casting.
"Jan 2, 2024",POSITIVE,i love the games and the movie captured that feel perfectly.
"Jan 1, 2024",POSITIVE,Everything is great in this movie except the casting
"Dec 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another IP that has been Rafe'd. Why do people employ Judkins to write? This film is one hot mess of dog doo doo. Characters with no Chemistry, terrible pacing, wooden acting, implausible situations, over reliance on CGI.

Do yourself a favour give it a miss."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good greif! Don't know why everyone is down  on this. If you want a romp, a bit of fun watch this. It's a bit tomb raider, it's a bit angels demons. Tom Holland knocks it out of the park, Mark Whalberg phones it in mostly. The ending is silly,  but enjoyed it overall. People chill and leave your expectations at the door. Enjoy it for what it is."
"Dec 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This film is pure cringe. The writing, the casting, the directing , is not good. Sorry but it will never be like the games."
"Dec 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing fun and silly but highly engaging family fun movie.
Can't wait for the sequel."
"Dec 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tom Holland does not fail to excite me, again! This movie has wonderful execution and great plot twists. The characters feel real, and the fight scenes are excellently choreographed. All the acting is phenomenal and this is definitely a must watch even for people who haven't played the games!"
"Dec 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"This is a fun entertaining romp in fun places. The chemistry between Holland and Walhberg is off the charts, adding to the entertainment. Just a lot of fun. (BTW, I don't play the game.)"
"Dec 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked it a lot. It's not the games. Though I appreciated the few nods to the games they threw in there. Had its own voice and sense of humor. I hope they make another one.
"Dec 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,This film has a problem with pacing its very slow and boring but it does not have that much action the summary is its a bit long and overstays its welcome
"Dec 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Uncharted"" can best be described as a lackluster adventure film that doomed itself into mediocrity by sitting on the fence between being an adaptation of the video game franchise, or just being its own thing. Incredibly poor casting choices for the majority of the characters compound the difficulty of finding it entertaining, and a lethargic and contrived storyline drives home the final nail. 

Concerning the plot, the movie mixes an ""original"" story with set pieces from the games in an awkward attempt to create an origin story for its main protagonist, Nathan Drake. While this might land decently for inattentive viewers not familiar with the source material or caring about the jumbled narrative, it creates a very confusing and irritating conundrum for those who know about Drake's past adventures and cannot reason why familier scenarios are playing out supposedly years earlier than the first game. Ultimately, this leaves the viewer with little choice but to relegate the movie into its own universe, which in turn frames the film as an inferior counterfeit in all aspects by comparison.

The narrative in question follows Drake as he sets off on a journey to locate his long lost brother after having been found by a past associate of his, Victor Sullivan, and enlisted into locating a fabled treasure. After the two meet up with Sullivan's ""partner"", Chloe Frazer, the team has to contend with both a rival team chasing after the same fortune and wrestling with each other over trust issues that arise each time one of them stabs the other in the back. When the treasure is eventually discovered in a haphazard manner (the puzzle in question having two solutions that the plot conveniently sorts out), the climax creates a scenario that is equal parts inventive and logically ludicrous; but primarily underwhelming given the poor character development and portrayal of all the characters present. Needless to say, while the story isn't wholly unwatchable, its habit of skipping around and dragging between action sequences kills any semblance of intrigue the film has.

By far the greatest detriment to movie, however, is its casting choices. Tom Holland's portrayal of Nathan Drake came off clunky and unbelievable, thanks largely in part to his youthful and naive appearance. Even if he wasn't compared to the characters's video game counterpart, which is impossible not to do for anyone who has seen him, his mannerisms lack any semblance of the maturity that the role calls for. Likewise, Mark Wahlberg's ""Sully"" was less of a rough-edged man of the world, and more resembling of a peddler of snake oil whose dignity was always kept at an utter minimum. While Sophia Ali's rendition of Chloe and Antonio Banderas's Santiago were both somewhat entertaining, both suffered removal by the time the final act came around: making their appearences in the film negligible in the long run. Lastly, Tati Gabrielle's Braddock fell completely flat in terms of overall threat, which in turn made the final conflict she appeared in bland and underwhelming.

In conclusion, ""Uncharted"" might best be praised for being an excellent cure for insomnia, as it's meandering and tasteless plot threads command little to no merit when placed side by side with films within the same genre. Worst still is the fact that it actively pillages from its own source material without commiting to either being something new outside of the franchise, or something that takes place within it. While it certainly isn't a terrible film outright, its poor casting, middling plot composition, and tedious pacing leave much to be desired. Compared to the original trilogy of stories, or even taken as a stand alone tale, the only treasure its viewers will find is a pile of insubstantial Fool's Gold."
"Dec 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A perfectly okay action adventure film, nothing more nothing less. As a fan of the games, I can't say I felt the same excitement and immersion during the movie as I did while playing the games. But regardless of whether you've played games or not, this is a perfectly fine, fairly mild action film with funny jokes and good twists."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's important to know that the games this is based on are some of my favourite games of all time. I don't mind adapting media, it can be done incredibly well and sometimes surpass the original. This is not one of those instances. This is an instance where they take something great and remove everything that made it good. It is totally soulless. It is a cash grab for Sony and nothing more than a paycheck for everyone working on it. Looking at the cast it seems they are just reciting their lines thinking about going back to their trailers. There is no charisma, no passion, no effort. The characters are gone and we're left with talking shells, there is no personality. The altered backstories take away from what made them who they are. The visual effects don't look very good. Even the simpler effects like hanging from a light on the ceiling look fake as if he's not actually holding his own weight. A lot of the time there is some action or whatever for no real reason, the motivation for so much of it is nonsensical. Maybe if you haven't played the games you'd think this is average but I have played the games and I found it dire and I wish I hadn't watched it."
"Dec 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,I never played the games and this movie was bbbaddd
"Dec 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This had a decent blend of ""tongue in cheek"" comedy and action. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by it, but Wahlberg is usually pretty entertaining and he didn't let himself down here. My partner is Chinese and Western Culture movies don't always hit the spot, but she liked this one.
I've seen better movies. But they were seriously good. This is definitely above average and a light hearted ""easy watch"""
"Dec 6, 2023",POSITIVE,"Waiting on the sequel.  Adventure, action, humor, and interesting characters."
"Dec 5, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie was a hit. It was like The Uncharted game except it's a movie. Tom Holland as Nathan Drake is perfect for the Uncharted movie.
"Dec 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"Honestly I think it´s a great movie to pass the time, laugh and enjoy, LOVE IT."
"Dec 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The opening scene of 'Unchartered' starts with a man falling out of a plane, gripping onto trailing cargo, and defying the slipstream by leaping between crates back towards the aircraft. Seriously?"
"Nov 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"More holes than a rusty sieve, predictable tosh, what was the scent that Sophia Ali trying to unsuccessfully pull off? Arguably Tom Holland carried the film, perhaps they could have saved the budget and just let him play the Playstation game on his own and save us the disappointment of watching the film."
"Nov 27, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The heroes keep solving puzzles to find out where to go on a globe-trotting treasure search, and the villains turn up 5 minutes later without any information, whoever wrote this trash wants a new job."
"Nov 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,The film had a fantastic cast with the charisma and humour you expect from Drake and Sully but was let down with the origin story nobody needed along with the frequent cliché heist betrayals. All I thought of was Rick and Mortys Heistatron 3000 had wrote this movie at points.
"Nov 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"well, it's fiction. you suspend belief and you let the story carry you away. this movie was a lot of fun."
"Nov 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"""Okay, we need an actor that is really popular, doesn't look like Nathan drake, doesn't have a father-son relationship with sully, and plays in a certain superhero movie that is a part of marvel. oh yeah! tom holland!"" why Sony why?! you own the I.P of the franchise, you own naughty dog studios, you know what the game is about, why did you choose tom holland? there is probably an actor that looks like Nathan, why him? no hate to tom, he is a good guy, but why him? the movie just sucks."
"Nov 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Seriously!??!!! The person who gave the green light to the script for this film needs to be fired. How on earth did the writers ever get jobs? I watched this mindless drivel until about 25 minutes from the end when the hidden treasure was found by driving a speedboat into the cave and diving 20 feet under water. It's one thing to believe (elsewhere in the film) that some-one can survive driving a car out of a plane without a parachute, but to believe that that in the 100+ years no tourist/local/cave diver etc. has ever been into this cave and 'discovered' two ships with gold is stretching every viewers intelligence beyond belief! It's not even lazy writing. It's just plain stupid writing. How do these people get jobs? Idiots."
"Nov 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,really bad script but decent special effects
"Nov 14, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Holland and Wahlberg are likeable enough as leads, but the story doesn't do enough to make the audience believe it, and the action scenes do only enough to get you to the next one. The scavenger hunt plot falls short of its predecessors (far below the standard set by National Treasure) but there's enough to enjoy it as a one-time watch. 4.5/10."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I love Tom Holland, he is an incredible actor, and deserves success… But this is a garbage cash grab. I think it would be possible for them to have written a good script and delivered a good movie, but I don't think anyone cared to or tried."
"Nov 11, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Where do I start ...
When I heard the movie was being made I was beyond excited. I have been an enormous fan of the games since day 1, so the prospect of a movie was just perfect.
However, my excitement did not last long.
From the poor casting choice, to the just downright confusing story. 
As a fan of the games I expected some similarities. There was just no resemblance to a franchise I love, other than character names. Take those away & it could be any treasure hunt action movie.
If you're not a fan of the games & know nothing about them, then you may enjoy this movie."
"Nov 6, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rafe can't write his way out of a wet paper sack. Stop giving this clown shows.
"Oct 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mean... As a movie it did the job. But as someone who loved the games, this film didn't have the soul or Easter eggs. The worst thing is the casting. I love lots of the actors but most of them weren't right for the characters."
"Oct 25, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tom Holland sucks and I didn't enjoy watching this movie. They don't make movies like they used to.
"Oct 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"Rudy Pankow looks great even if he doesn't have too much screen time, his chemistry with young Nate was incredible and I would like to see him in more big roles like this"
"Oct 19, 2023",POSITIVE,Not for the over-critical but it's a fun romp if you've got a spare couple of hours
"Oct 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"One of the worst movies I'ver watched. Corny, expected, terrible acting, direction, and dialogues. 40 rotten tomatoes is generous. It deserved 4/100"
"Oct 14, 2023",POSITIVE,One of my new found favorites! Really hope there's a second with the original actors.
"Oct 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"Critics get it wrong again.  Great movie.  Could have done without Tati Gabrielle, but outside of her, it was entertaining."
"Sep 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Truly one of the movies I have ever seen. This is what happens when you spend all your money on signing that Doja Cat wannabe and Antonio Banderas and run out of budget for an actual writer. Has the emotional depth of a puddle of shit and also its stink. The worse part by far was when Frazer came in and said ""it's frazing time"" and frazed all over Sam's letters. Stinky butthole peepee movie."
"Sep 23, 2023",POSITIVE,"Taking videogames to the big screen is always a tough task, but Uncharted manages to do a decent job."
"Sep 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I didn't play the game, but I still thought it was a good action movie with great action scenes, but many of them are quite fictional. Characters that began to get lost throughout the film, in addition to having a very tiring and somewhat boring story.
I liked Tom Holland in the role, besides him being delicious and a great hottie, WHAT A MAN"
"Sep 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"If you don't look at this as Uncharted, its a pretty good action movie but its a bad Uncharted movie. terrible casting for Nate and Sully. Tom and Mark just don't have the personality of the characters and Toms acting seems to be kind of bad when he is trying to be serious, just cant take him seriously. Overall decent movie but bad Uncharted movie."
"Sep 19, 2023",POSITIVE,I really enjoyed the movie. I can't wait to see if there will be a sequel.
"Sep 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I haven't played the video game based on this movie so I'm just judging on what I've seen here. Uncharted had its moments of fun and adventure although I felt like it was a long wait to get there! The action scenes were a little over done in my opinion, but perhaps that was the intention here?? Admiring Tom Holland's tight, sexy little body made Uncharted worth watching to the end!"
"Sep 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Fun movie with beautiful, stylish sets and locations.  Fast-paced dialogue, astonishingly clever stunts, and lots of action in beautiful locations.  Good casting.  Leaves you with something to look forward to as well."
"Sep 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Amazing movie with an interesting story, it kept true to Uncharted besides the fact that the main character is an inexperienced person. Also which is rare, it's a very good standalone movie for someone who doesn't know anything about the games."
"Sep 8, 2023",NEGATIVE,Well this movie was a waste of time 🫤
"Sep 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,As a fan of the games I went into this movie with low expectations but overall I enjoyed it way more than I thought I was going to. It's not a perfect movie but it's worth the watch.
"Sep 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,I like the movie. I would give it a 5 if they truly filmed in the Philippines.
"Sep 3, 2023",POSITIVE,"Tom Holland was such an amazing role for him to play growing up playing all the uncharted on the ps4 1,2,3 and watching YouTube videos of gamers play this game was just such a huge impact and happiness."
"Sep 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hot trash. How it has a 90% audience score I will never understand. Action sequences like Michael Bay, unrealistic, unbelievable and lacking in substance."
"Sep 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Surprisingly, this was a really fun film with a good story and good action sequences.  There were shades of the Indiana Jones films there.  It's worthy of a sequel."
"Aug 30, 2023",POSITIVE,I really liked this movie even if it wasn't completely accurate to the games it was a fun film that was very entertaining and enjoyable
"Aug 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,Uncharted is a fun action adventure film that constantly provides a fun and exciting narrative to follow.
"Aug 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Meh, could have been better, not like games violence, ending sucks, the pirates should have left and kied her, and why have Antonio die, terrible choice. Needed more Nathan Fillion humour like the game, sequel needs to be darker"
"Aug 20, 2023",NEGATIVE,Didn't feel the same without Nathan fillion crazy he wasn't asked to do the lead role as the only reason this movie got made was because he was in a fan made movie of uncharted which is available on YouTube
"Aug 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a great movie until one thing happend.
The action is good and the setpieces are great and I found Mark Whalberg is good at being Sully."
"Aug 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Nice but its like problem are resolved too quick. Normally, it should be a trilogy and in the end of the third film. They find the gold...
We have the same problem with the Assassin s creed movie...
Its like there are afraid that the movie won't work so they take too much shortcut and easyness."
"Aug 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good movie, like national treasure with more humor"
"Aug 17, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing movie. Reminds me of the Goonies but more modern with a different cast obviously. Wishing for the second one to come out soon.
"Aug 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie tries so much but has no soul. Braindead characters, braindead plot. How can studios spent these amounts of money to films that in the end feel so cheap and purely like waste of time."
"Aug 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was fun to watch, Nothing special tho."
"Aug 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Tati ruins this movie. Completely unbelievable character. Just nonsense
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,These are my kind of movies as they are fun and entertaining. I really hope we get an Uncharted 2.
"Aug 14, 2023",POSITIVE,Action Packed and fun to watch!  I recommend it to everyone.
"Aug 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ok, fora um pouco do jogo . Sem puzzles e quebra cabeças descentes. Básico."
"Aug 12, 2023",NEGATIVE,Straining credulity at the best of times.
"Aug 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Indiana Jones is Coke, National Treasure is Diet Coke, this is a can of generic Cola that is warm and flat."
"Aug 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A good film. Not going to blow your mind, Sully doesn't feel like Sully. Tom becomes a good Nate by the end though. The film radiates Uncharted vibes despite it all. Very Uncharted 4 inspired. I appreciate what was done. Inoffensive and a fun watch! Will certainly watch the sequel and could definitelysee them improving but a solid first go! 👍"
"Aug 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was amazing acting, action, and CGI, but some language was foul for a younger audience. Plus some of the one liners were cringy. But overall an excellent movie"
"Aug 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"As playstation Player I was hoping this movie will take me back to uncharted World. Unfortunatelly, directors decided to take all 4 games and wipe their assess with Nathan adventures in games. Instead they created this mix of bullshit and bad action. Even actors dont look like characters from game. Sorry but I was fighting to finish this movie, very bad."
"Aug 3, 2023",POSITIVE,very entertaining movie with 2 great main characters played by 2 great actors.
"Aug 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,Needs more Nathan Fillion.
"Aug 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"I loved uncharted. Its had poor reviews but I thought it was an excellent adaptation of the games. As well as being sort of nostalgic to the likeness of the classic adventure films like ""National Treasure"" and the ""Indiana Jones"" films.  I watched in theaters and rewatched it as soon as it was put on Netflix and three times since then. Loved Tom and Mark; Great Duo!"
"Aug 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is good action movie, with high quality. At one moment movie remind me Mission Imposible for dynamics, I didn't play Uncharted, but I know that Uncharted is like Tomb Raider and I like Tomb Raider.
Conclusion: I think this film will be interesting for all family, and I I'm glad I watched this film."
"Jul 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,This is to action adventure as Sharknado is. Unwatchable.
"Jul 28, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Uncharted

A safe action flick.

The title of this movie evokes the feel of something new or fresh, but Uncharted is nothing of that sort. It's very reminiscent of flicks like Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean, without the charm that those flicks hold.

Tom Holland is a very capable lead, and he does his best to provide a memorable protagonist. Tati Gabrielle and Antonio Banderas as villains aren't opposing or menacing enough; Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg as a pair are also fair.

The action sequences are good, especially the one that occurs in the air (though a little farfetched), but they don't elicit genuine danger for the protagonists. The treasure hunt also feels contrived, and the path they tread to acquire it is bland and unexciting.

At the end of it all, Uncharted is an average action flick.

5/10"
"Jul 28, 2023",NEUTRAL,"85/100 - mark whalberg and tom holland make a good duo. the plot is kind of convoluted but its something you expect from this genre of film. cool to see, not a classic, but a fun watch. maybe even a couple times."
"Jul 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"I just love it, it has good characters, good story and at the end it has a big bang. The end battle is my favorite part, it looks awesome with the over 500 year old ships flying around in the sky. I give it 4 stars"
"Jul 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I just rewatched Uncharted.

I seem to be reviewing a lot of movies that are products of many years in production hell recently lol. The Uncharted movie is no exception. In this case, I even watched from the sidelines every step of the way.

I waited for this movie for so fucking long. You also gotta understand that Uncharted is one of my favorite video game franchises, and Uncharted 4 IS my favorite game of all time. Uncharted has huge potential to be a great movie.

That's honestly my biggest problem with his movie… It's pretty good, but not in the way I wanted it to be. It's quite different from the games in a lot of essential areas. After many castings and directors and all that crap for years, they landed on Tom Holland as Nathan Drake.

There's a clip of Tom Holland saying Uncharted is his favorite game. I swear to God, that was all it took for Sony to hire him to leech off of his popularity because they hadn't known wtf to do with this project for years lol. Tom Holland is Spider-Man in the MCU.

Sony owns Spider-Man and has a deal with Disney to let him be in their movies. Sony also owns Playstation, and Uncharted is a Playstation-exclusive gaming franchise. Tom Holland is popular rn and likes Uncharted? ""Cast him and force it to fit even if it doesn't!"" 💀

I'm not gonna lie, Tom Holland would be a great younger Nate. There's a flashback in the third game that shows how he met Sully when he was young. Tom is great for that version. But an entire movie centered around such a young Nate? No thanks.

He's in his 30's or something in the games, probably 40's by the 4th game. Tom Holland's Nate can hardly be much older than 20. Not 20's, 20. This ofc also means that Sully is way too young. Some of his most characteristic features are that he's an old man with a mustache.

This Sully doesn't have a gray hair on his head, and no mustache. Like bro, couldn't he even have the classic mustache? Mark Wahlberg is Victor Sullivan in this movie. He was originally supposed to play Nathan (acceptable casting choice, but not great).

But the movie took so long to be made that he ended up being Sully instead… 💀 So yeah, I don't agree with making them both so young. They also do not follow the same storyline as the games, which I would've preferred. Instead, they do something rather odd.

I much would've preferred him in her role throughout the rest of the film. I also found Chloe's backstab and collaboration with the bad guys a bit forced. It seemed like just a tool to drive the story in a certain direction.
K1lling the first villain was also a tool to have her join Nate again. I feel like the execution could've gone differently, but oh well. They edited together Nate and Chloe's research session very cleverly by the way.
My biggest problem with the movie, aside from the source material diversion, is the third act. Things got a little too wild and ridiculous. I'm sorry, but those two little pu$$y helicopters carrying those huge pirate ships in the air, and for that long? Hell no.
It's too unrealistic, even for Uncharted. Out of all the supernatural shit from the games, this was more unrealistic. I wasn't able to take it seriously, it's just dumb. They're wayyyyyyy too heavy, and also old and rotten, so they would've broken right away.
How did they even tie them up like that, let alone that quickly? 😭A type of pirate ship battle could've been very cool, though. If they somehow blew up the cave and literally sailed them out on the water, a battle like this would've worked.
The helicopters still could've been involved fairly similarly, just not by lifting the fucking ships up in the air. I miss two characteristic features of Nathan's in this movie. The parkour and climbing for one.
There was some parkour, but I would've liked to see a lot more of that stuff. Secondly, I miss Nathan Drake casually being a psychopath and murd3ring literally hundreds of random people without it ever affecting him lmfao. Hey, it's game accurate…
Other than that they did a good job at including most of the sequences an Uncharted game consists of. Even the puzzles and shit. And I gotta say, Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland have surprisingly good chemistry.
I like that they teased a movie more faithful to the games in the end-credit scene. Sully even finally grew his mustache and everything.
In conclusion, I'm relatively satisfied with the movie for what it is. I'm really looking forward to new movies. I'm just trying to accept this as a reimagining and separate the two iterations of Uncharted."
"Jul 22, 2023",NEGATIVE,Tom holland can't act.. he knows how to play a whinney child that's it.
"Jul 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A bunch of twists and turns paired with Tom Holland's charismatic performance makes Uncharted a pretty entertaining action and adventure movie, but it struggles to set itself apart from other movies from the genre."
"Jul 17, 2023",POSITIVE,"Was it realistic? Heck no. Was the storyline easy to follow? Definitely not. Did Mark deliver an outstanding performance of a ‘good anti-hero'? Absolutely! Mark and Tom did an amazing job here! Thanks to them and the excitement of this movie, it can easily cover over most of the narrative pitfalls."
"Jul 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Another absurd and stupid attack to the Glorious Hispanic history by hollywood. Drake was just a dirty and cheater pirate rat. Juan Sebastián Elcano and Magallanes were another important Spaniard explorers for the world, they really marked the human geography."
"Jul 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,It's a pretty mid movie.
"Jul 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"It was an amazing adventure movie with a great story and characters, but it never convinced me once that I was watching a movie based on the game. Holland and Mark are great in the movie, but not even close to Nathan Drake and Sully from the games. I wish they just called it something else besides Uncharted lol"
"Jul 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was entertaining, yet another Indiana Jones type of Adventure movie. Other than the fact, that it is set in the modern Era. It was just about run of the mill, Adventure flick. I will admit, it was entertaining yes. But that's about all the good I can say about it."
"Jul 12, 2023",POSITIVE,its pretty good but i felt like the ending could've been them getting the ships instead of losing everything in it
"Jul 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie is great, it's action and entertaining. Tom Holland looks wonderful, and his character as Nathan Drake promises a lot, I hope there will be a second installment. The critics suck as always."
"Jul 5, 2023",POSITIVE,i loved everything about this movie! Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are two of my favorite actors that work great together and I can't wait for part 2. the way they played off of each other made it that much more enjoyable.
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The casting is all wrong 
Tom Holland is not Nathan drake 
Nathan drake dose not say sorry after chucking a villain out of a plane 
Nathan drake dose not just carry a gun to look cool
He isn't shocked at firing it when needed 
This was spider man pretending to be a treasure hunter 
What should have been the next Indiana jones is instead a movie to sell the franchise to a younger fan base who would not get any enjoyment out of their source material
Sully is also way to young you needed a wise untrustworthy bandit that Nathan could look up to as a savy father figure who puts the hunt for wealth above all things 
Here's hoping they age the characters up for a sequel and make them more true to who they are meant to be 
The one saving grace is a brilliant final act but by the time these characters even slightly feel like what there supposed to the credits are soon rolling 
And not using the iconic theme that made the series iconic is a crime 
People don't want a cameo clip they want to feel swept away by the world and it's music."
"Jul 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Watching this film won't change your life and considering it has 2 actors I love (Damon and Holland) and I love the Indianna Jones films this film is underwhelming. I found myself reaching for my phone a few times and even writing this review 😬 The CGI was actually pretty good and the film has some interesting moments but all the ""tense"" situations didn't feel it."
"Jul 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"Video game movies tend to always be terrible, almost always falling short of hype, or even in many cases touching on the nostalgia you'd got the first time you touched the game...

Uncharted is the first I've experienced that absolutely delivers on both of those levels. 

While the story itself is very much standalone for sense of a movie many aspects throughout the series of games are included and incorporated into the action and storyline. 

All actors nailed the main roles in Drake, Sully, and Clohe... but where's Elana, Nates primary love interest? A key feature that cannot be overlooked by true Uncharted fans, leaves an otherwise great movie just a smidgen short."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Hey, look, it's Tom Holland! And Mark Wahlberg! And Antonio Band- oh, wait, well, I guess not. Well, at least Mark Wahlberg doesn't look like, sound, and act like a non-playable character in a video game. And at least those pirate ships look real. I mean, come on, of course they could be airlifted by helicopters a third of the weight of the actual ships. And the gold wouldn't weigh the ships down at all. All in all, a solid film."
"Jun 30, 2023",NEGATIVE,"An absolute butchering of the source material, and having miscasted actors with a bland MacGuffin quest (Uncharted has always been about this sort of thing, but they somehow managed to make it generic and plain.) Uncharted squanders its source material in pursuit of being its own thing, with the occasional hint of a adaptation. And in the end everyone ends up disappointed."
"Jun 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,The only positive side is that to confirm tom holland can be a movie star rather than that the movie was poorly directed and the remaning cast grin like a cheshire cat out of the ridicoulously script and diologs
"Jun 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,It was nice to look at.  Cliche-ridden hunt for the treasure in a dungeon movie.  Bad guys vs worse guys.  I wanted them to fail.  Kids will like it.  Thrilling chase at the end.
"Jun 26, 2023",POSITIVE,Exceed expectations!
"Jun 25, 2023",POSITIVE,I honestly loved it its a amazing movie and more people need to watch it.
"Jun 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's not necessarily bad, but it's definitely rushed. Realistically this movie should have been another hour long. I just felt like I had to develop a relationship with the characters too fast, which left me feeling like I didn't know them at all by the end of the movie. 
I know it's based on the game, so perhaps the target audience was more the fans of the game than someone who hasn't played the series. 
It left me yearning for Drake and Sully to be formally recognized as the ones who discovered Magellan's gold, because in the end, that's all that would have mattered to me, so the lack of that happening made me feel hollow. That could be on me though, with my inability to suspend disbelief while watching this film.
I went into it with my mind drifting towards the movie National Treasure, because the two share similarities in that the Drakes wanted to rectify their name, same as the Gates' family in National Treasure, by finding a legendary lost treasure that many think is a myth."
"Jun 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Pretty fun movie, it's probably a 3.5 because there was just a slight lack of character substance but it seemed hard to fit with all the action and mystery so i'll forgive it. It's already long enough"
"Jun 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Not too related to the game. If we evaluate it only as a film, it still has problems in the relationships between the characters. Certain quite epic even if unreal scenes are appreciable."
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,Great mix of the storyline and action.  Not overly mission impossible like...yet Tom Holland did have a young MI vibe....
"Jun 20, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great parody towards the games. To make it clear the uncharted games are my favorite games of all time so I was really looking forward to watching this in which it was amazing. My only problem is the way they presented Sully in this film. Mark 
Wahlberg was a good choice, but the character Sully just seems really grumpy and uncaring most of the times which is opposite to the games adaptation of the character. Other than that great movie, I would recommend watching."
"Jun 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"Watched on Amazon. Really great and fun movie. Can't believe less than 50% from critics, 90% from audiences is more realistic. What is wrong with these critics. They get EVERYTHING wrong. Rubbish gets a high score, good movies get a bad score. You need to change your reviewers panel Rotten Tomatoes. These people know nothing about movies."
"Jun 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slick, sexy, and dumb.  Certainly action-packed but kinda dull and soulless.
It's not horrible, but brought me no pleasure.  Great movie for kids though.  Pretty innocuous and colorful."
"Jun 17, 2023",POSITIVE,We watched it with our three kids (two of them boys) and they loved it - they loved the banter between Nate & Sully (Tom and Mark has great brotherly chemistry which kept the movie fun!!). As parents the swearing was at a minimum which was kind of good. (I mean they probably hear more in the school yard!!). A really great popcorn movie for a family. We are all really hoping for all the cast to all come back for Uncharted 2. Cheers Guys! Well Done on a great movie!!!
"Jun 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"It is an incredible movie, 1 hour and 57 minutes is not enough for a great story, it is difficult to forget."
"Jun 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Having admittedly never played the video game on which Uncharted is based, I certainly hope it's nothing like the film: dull, unoriginal, and devoid of chemistry."
"Jun 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"For what it was I enjoyed it. Simple story but kept me entertained. Never played Uncharted but definitely aware of it. Holland and Wahlberg are both good, the doublecrossing gets a little tedious but again if you're looking just to be entertained and not astonished by a great script then its worth the watch."
"Jun 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"What a fun ride! I went into Uncharted with low expectations and I walked away pleased with the finished product. Led by great chemistry between Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, there wasn't a dull moment. The action was unique (Holland's parkour was a highlight), the quips were pretty funny and the adventure provided escapism in its purest form.

While highly entertaining, the only way to enjoy this movie is to leave logic at the door. Gravity works a little differently, the clues unfold a little too easily (where did those helicopters come from?) and the characters are able to withstand quite the beating. I wanted the antagonist's motivations to be stronger and some of the relationships were underdeveloped (other than Nate and Sully).

In the end, I would gladly watch Uncharted again and I am hopeful for a sequel."
"Jun 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,Decent enough movie. The game is better.
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,A huge fan of the games…and I loved the movie! I want to see a sequel!
"Jun 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"I know this movie didn't have the best or most coherent story but it was a fun action pact adventure you can get lost in with beautiful sets and fun dialogue, Tom Holland and mark walberg bring a cheerful chemistry that made me enjoy it even more I'll keep watching this movie just to have fun"
"Jun 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Amazing action packed adventure.
"Jun 3, 2023",POSITIVE,A lovely videogame adaptation. It has some issues but still a movie to watch it at home when you are not sure what to watch on a Sunday night
"Jun 2, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I hate this movie,  it gave me eye cancer"
"May 31, 2023",POSITIVE,"This movie is fantastic! The adventure, humor, and life it brings to the characters of the beloved games! I've played the games for years and never felt the connection to Nathan Drake's character. Tom Holland, while acting with his expected charm, adds a new edge that makes it hard to get distracted from the screen."
"May 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,Man its good but the history is a little bit bad and the dub to brazil is a TRASH but is a good film
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"A Fantastic action adventure movie! A fresh mix of a few pretty good hits like ""The DaVinci code"", some ""Mission Impossible"" flavours here and there, some good ""James Bond"" / ""Kingsman"" humor and a sprinkle of some downright legendary ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" vibes! Both Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are fantastic! They play off of each other exceptionally well, great on screen match! The movie has a good pace to it! The plot is good, at the very least, it has some very nice turns (for about an hour you feel like sth should def. happen - and guess what? IT HAPPENS!) I HAD SO MUCH FUN! :)"
"May 29, 2023",POSITIVE,"Although a bit rushed, it's a quality film I'd watch again. I loved how the story was wrapped around the history of Spanish colonization. Please say there's a sequel in the works!"
"May 28, 2023",POSITIVE,Lo recomiendo mucho ver la película. Conocerás a NATHAN DRAKE en la gran pantalla y para el público del cine lo recomiendo 100% la película. Yo le doy un 8/10
"May 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some nostalgia as someone who used to watch their sister play the game. Interesting direction to go with Nate's character, by making this his first adventure, though it does bring to question why Sully had so much faith in Nate's ability to contribute to their plan (being interested in history, good at pickpocketing, and Sam's brother is enough for him I guess). I hope additional movies come out to really flesh out their relationship. I somewhat enjoyed the whole ""don't know who to trust"" dynamic between everyone, though they didn't take it too seriously considering how it never genuinely killed the playful banter between characters. I'm wondering where they plan on going with Chloe and if they plan on ever including Elena in future movies, although I support excluding her here since there would not have been enough time to flesh out another character relationship. 
Spoilers:
Ship scene was pretty, cannon ball was completely out-there but fun.
Did not enjoy that one joke at the pirate wheel in the middle of the action - sort of took me out of it. I was also confused about the ""fire distraction"" in the club(?) scene, considering it took 2 seconds to put it out and drew attention to them rather than away - maybe the reasoning was that people would run away and make it chaotic, but I don't remember seeing that.
Moncada was a charicature, which is okay, and I can respect that they included the scenes with his father to flesh out his motivations instead of a singular monologue. The acting for Braddock also felt sort of forced, especially in the auction scene with how she would speak to Sully, but the strain in her relationship with Moncada was interesting as well as its ""resolution"" - I'm interested in how she got all his goons on her side, but it probably just amounts to how much of a cut she promised them. 
Cute and fun overall, would not mind seeing another movie."
"May 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"People liked this movie because of Tom holland and Mark Whalberg. No one freaking payed attention to the messed up storyline. What was going on? How does a long pirate hunt to correlate to finding your long lost brother. The after scenes didn't even budge any suspension. Other than the story, the acting wasn't terrible, the characters weren't necessarily AMAZINGLY written but you could tell the actors did their best to play them. The effects were not good, but it's Netflix so we aren't expecting much, especially after watching projects like, red notice and Enola Holmes. I think if you want to watch it your brain will think you liked because of the star studded cast and storyline,  but if you take a step back and notice the plot wholes, terrible character development, and a mature effects, it's actually not that good."
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"So bad that i could not watch to the end, my god what a s…t!!"
"May 18, 2023",POSITIVE,"its amazing, most references of the game, tom holland incredible"
"May 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg being cast as the two main stars of this movie is what ruined it for me

Don't get me wrong these two men are great talented actors and it's not that I dislike them it's that I felt that they were out of place as the lead characters in the movie.

They always make mistakes like this with video game movies when it comes to Casting and it drives me crazy. 

It was disappointing it stinks....
The entire time I just felt like I was watching these two guys stroke each other's egos because they are big Hollywood actors I could not suspend my disbelief and I think it's just stupid that there is absolutely no art or thought in Hollywood anymore it's like they've all just stopped caring about the art."
"May 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Based on one of the best game franchises, can't say the same about the movie that has poor writing, poor action, poor characters, etc."
"May 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,"With a cast like this, you'd expect quite a bit.  
The acting is quite poor, plot full of major holes, the whole movie is insanely predictable - fast action but no sustenance."
"May 12, 2023",POSITIVE,Loved it from beginning to end!
"May 8, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed seeing the characters in the movie, although some parts could have been different"
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's a nice simple adventure, The plot, pacing, and characters are great, and the acting is good, the character arc is perfect."
"May 7, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie is honestly really good. I think they hid a lot of easter eggs in there for gamers coming from the game. I think the personality of the movie gave off a good and fun vibe. This movie is good for all ages in my personal opinion as its fun for kids and is fun for any adults watching this.
"May 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's the kind of film you watch in theaters and can enjoy, but ultimately don't really need to see again. The plot is fine, the acting was good, and the action is quite fun. I'd certainly say check it out if you're interested, but it's not a movie that exactly stands out compared to other adventure films."
"May 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I admit I expected MUCH less from this movie but by the time I watch it I broke my face and really liked the plot. The characters are interesting and FOR me the plot unfolds in a pleasant way and good moments of twist. The action scenes are well choreographed especially Tom's, I hope they continue the story in sequences. SPOILERS to follow, the scene that shows Sam in an air that in the next movie he and Natham will reerect and go after what is being sought since the clue in the post-credit scene. Finally, I highly recommend it. ;)"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Good movie, story line was great! Loved this adaptation! However, as much as I love tom holland, he is a bit young looking  to be playing Nathan drake. He lacks the gruffness, and manliness that Nathan has. Tom still looks like he can play a high schooler."
"Apr 26, 2023",POSITIVE,really enjoyed it but felt too pressed for time. would love to see a sequel that is slower paced and can invite maybe a third movie setup like the games.
"Apr 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,The casting director deserves to never work again. Those are not Nathan Drake or Sully. Terrible choices that lead to a movie perfect for a hangover nap.
"Apr 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"El trabajo no es perfecto, pero la actuación es impresionante, y la trama es buena para mi, talvez no perfecta, pero si es buena."
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Great movie with a good cast. The only thing that bothered me is that there were not many puzzles, which are the main part of the game. Other than that it really hit home with the nostalgia."
"Apr 21, 2023",POSITIVE,"Really enjoyed this movie it's one I would watch over, Tom Holland was great and some good effects. Mark Wahlberg didn't quite fit the role for me."
"Apr 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A very weak ""action"" movie which was nothing but a poor rehash of almost every action movie made. Poor writing and the acting was even worse."
"Apr 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,"É legal porém esquecível, eu gostei do filme, mas não acho que me impactou muito. Contém bastante cenas de ação e aventura, só não fez muito impacto em mim"
"Apr 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"I've watched this movie so many times and I absolutely love it. I don't care what the haters of this movie say because I found this to be very good and entertaining and I hope it becomes a franchise like the Video Games because those are good as well. I know they merged the first four games in one movie but, that actually worked for me."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie the story always had my attention and the comedy was great I would suggest you to watch this
"Apr 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The climatic end scene is climatic for literally no reason, one of the main characters can very easily solve the problem in like an instant. Absolutely ruins the film, will actively avoid anything that screenwriter makes ever again, ruins literally the entire movie."
"Apr 10, 2023",POSITIVE,This was so much better than I thought it was going to be. Such a fun and enjoyable movie. Really hoping for a second film!
"Apr 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,"No real logic in this movie. The treasure could have been found by a tourist at anytime. It is more a fantastic movie where physics rules do not apply. Thats a pity... it could have been developed better without the poor story, not engaging at all. Indiana Jones, I miss you"
"Apr 9, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not the best adaptation of a video game to a movie. But at least he tries, and he doesn't do too badly. In fact the movie was very well paced and I'm waiting for the sequel to see how it expands."
"Apr 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had way more fun than expected watching this adventure-packed film, with a very charming lead."
"Apr 4, 2023",NEGATIVE,As a lover of all of the games this was a poor adaptation of the games that I loved they mixed up the story they didn't stick to any of the scripts of the games
"Apr 2, 2023",POSITIVE,"Hollywood occasionally runs out of ideas or bases its ideas on other mediums to keep going. I used to love playing video games as a kid and I still do on occasion, but I prefer movies. Only in this case, it is a movie based on a video game. But it's a game of chance whether or not it will be good. Thankfully, it's a great movie.
Nathan Drake is a down-on-his-luck bartender/conman, young and likable but he has an adventurous spirit that has him wanting to get into trouble. Having a childhood that wasn't ideal, Nathan at least had a brother he looked up to and wants to find again after being forced to leave him. Having looked up to stories of pirates and treasure he gets the opportunity of a lifetime to find treasure with the help of an acquaintance of his brother. A multibillion-dollar treasure of gold and history is sought by Nathan and several nefarious people as murder, theft abounds so do adventure and excitement as well as the hope of Nathan finding a purpose to his life.

I didn't know what to expect from this movie except for a duo of immensely likable action stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, but after having seen my fair share of bad movies, this was a breath of fresh air. Great action, adventure, talented performers, old faces, and new faces. I got to say I never heard of Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle before, but wow, hot and talented ladies. Can't wait to see them again. But more importantly, is the fact that this was a great story."
"Mar 31, 2023",NEGATIVE,While there was some scenes i enjoyed in the movie it's just not as what I expected it to be i thought maybe the movie can't be that bad as some people say but i was completely wrong
"Mar 31, 2023",POSITIVE,I liked the mystery of the movie. The storyline of a secret mission fits the final scene very well because they have to work their way up to find the treasure. I like how Victor Sullivan in the movie can act like Natan Drakes's older brother at some moments even though he never saw his brother again. I recommend this movie to people who are into adventure movies. This is a great movie.
"Mar 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"Movie was good. Entertaining, light, charming. It's like it was shot in one take. Tom starts off a bit on the stiff side but develops really good. Sophia makes her character shine. Mark is great as always. Overall a fun movie to watch on a Sunday night before you go to bed."
"Mar 26, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Good grief the absolute worst. Two hours I will never get back. Endlessly bland, poorly acted, ugly, terrible plot and dialogue. Set piece action movie that is in no way exciting. Carried none of the personality and charm of the game based versions of the characters. Terrible terrible poo. I would not trust the critical faculties of anyone who thought this pap was good."
"Mar 24, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's definitely over hated, as even though the lead actors are mis cast, it's unique and fresh. In my opinion, it's really entertaining"
"Mar 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"not outright atrocious, but not something amazing. Not much sets this apart from other movies like it."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"While the cast are not bad, they're still not the perfect fit for the characters originally imagined in the video game series (except maybe for Chloe). The movie is not boring and rather enjoyable, except it's not that inventive, neither when it comes to the plot nor the direction. There may be a few cracks here and there, but that's what can also be found in the video games. The animation and special effects are not bad. In all, Uncharted is an above-average movie which lives up to the original content by interpreting all that is relevant from the beloved video game series."
"Mar 18, 2023",NEGATIVE,Ridiculous movie. Reminded me or Indiana jones but totally unrealistic
"Mar 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,I think this movie miscast a lot of its major roles. I had fun with it but it never really cracked the surface of its gaming counterpart. Would love to see them give it another try.
"Mar 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Very disappointed. I had high hopes since I enjoyed the video games. This movie had very little to do with the games. Felt like it was written by 15 year olds for 10 year olds to watch. Improbable stunts, bad CGI, annoying characters.  And of course they ended the movie alluding to a sequel, that I will never watch. Just a horrible movie."
"Mar 13, 2023",NEGATIVE,Most corny p.o.s I have seen this year. Must have been made for 10 year olds or the Chinese as they love corny stupid movies and Hollywood makes way more off of them. Don't waste your time on this movie. The video game wasn't this corny.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,A solid adventure movie that while Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are miss cast it's still cool to see them on screen. This really has not much to do with the Uncharted games besides from a couple sequences. It could have done a lot more to stand out among other adventure films by using more elements from the games but compared to the other video game movies we have this is one of the better ones. 6.5/10
"Mar 9, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie is amazing. I definitely recommend it. It is funny too.
"Mar 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,its good ig its like indiana jones
"Mar 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,It passed the time but got pretty boring in the middle.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Just saw it and Loved it. I liked that They Took the characters from Uncharted and made their own story with Them and didn't do a adaptaion of the game. Hope a sequel comes.
"Mar 4, 2023",POSITIVE,The movie was very entertaining but also in some parts had corny ass lines that make you wince. But overall very enjoyable and keeps throwing curveballs. Definitely don't need any prior knowledge of the series (I don't).
"Mar 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A soulless cash grab which feels like the studio never wanted to make a film about the uncharted game but wanted to us the IP to make some money of fans who actually wanted to see a good uncharted movie, so they hired trending actors which don't fit their roles; watched a couple of clips of game footage and made a average at best adventure movie"
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,Great movie definitely going to recommend this movie to my YouTube channel!
"Mar 1, 2023",POSITIVE,the movie was very good i hope there will be a part 2
"Feb 26, 2023",POSITIVE,"The elohssa  ""professional critics"" have never spent one second in uniform or defending our country. They should immediately be banned from this site.

Them movie was well cast, acted and done."
"Feb 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"A moderately interesting action movie that stars Tom Holand being ... Tom Holand. Maybe fans of the video game will appreciate the storyline and set pieces more, but to someone with no previous exposure to the brand, it just seemed like an overly sentimental treasure hunting movie.

The best part is Mark Wahlberg's big brotherly digs at Holand's character.

It's not a bad time - it's got mystery, Tom Holand shows off his acrobatic skills, and there's a poetic ending. Just don't go out of your way to see it."
"Feb 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,"First things first, overall I liked this movie. If you know NOTHING about the video games and just want a fun, mindless, globetrotting ""treasure hunting"" adventure movie, this works really well. HOWEVER... I have 3 minor issues that directly relates to the deviation from the source material. 

(First issue: casting) Tom Holland is an awesome actor, as is Mark Wahlberg, but they're greatly miscast. By the time we meet Nathan Drake in the video game, he's supposed to be this world-wearied treasure hunter. Sure, I know, the creators were aiming to create an origin story but Holland's Drake is way too young. Then to be thrust into leading this expedition, something he's never done before nor has any experience, felt clumsy and rushed. 

(Second issue: set pieces) Next, it felt as though the creators tried to create a ""best of"" highlight reel, encompassing some of the biggest action set pieces over four mainline video games. For example, right from the start Nathan Drake is hanging off a crate, dangling outside of a cargo plane. He then climbs back to the plane only to inevitably get kicked back out and now have to seek a parachute on one of the crates before it crash lands back to Earth. Was this what the creators felt endured fans to the series? Sure the games were known for the action set pieces but each game ramped up so that the plane stunt felt earned by the THIRD GAME!! Yet, here we are, swinging for the fences right from the start. 

(Third issue: out of touch creators) In the games, characters Nathan and Sully would constantly banter back and forth about historical accounts of real-life famous explorers and locales and the subsequent legends that formed afterwards. Unlike Indiana Jones or National Treasure, however, the legends actually turned out to be true (the tree of life growing up from the fountain of youth for example) only with disastrous consequences. So when the creators instead choose to focus attention on the action set pieces (an admittedly small part of the game), over the treasure hunting and legends, the movie takes away what truly felt special. Instead, we're left with just another treasure hunting movie.

Overall I liked the movie, but I overall the creators missed an opportunity to make something great..."
"Feb 22, 2023",POSITIVE,"It's just fun. Faithful to the source material, if you like the games there are good chances you'll like this movie."
"Feb 18, 2023",POSITIVE,This movie had a great storyline and many unexpected scenes which made the movie very interesting. We love the combination of hilarious actors which made our day. I really do hope we get Uncharted 2. Well done you made our day! We are waiting...😀😃💯
"Feb 17, 2023",POSITIVE,I'm a huge fan of both Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg so I knew I was going to like this movie and I sure did. It had a great mixture of both comedy and action and it's a enjoyable adventure for sure .
"Feb 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Exactly the kind of action hero we need right now. Tom Holland does excellent as a young Nathan Drake, Mark Wahlburg as Sully could use some work but other than that it's a good movie that'll keep you invested the whole way through"
"Feb 15, 2023",NEGATIVE,"The good-funny, action sequences were fun.  Neat references.
The bad-cliche, same tropes, predictable.
The ugly-dragged a little bit."
"Feb 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Columbia Pictures finally brings their long-awaited ‘Uncharted' adaptation to audiences in the form of a swashbuckling prequel to the games starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. ‘Zombieland' director Ruben Fleischer takes over from the plethora of directors slated to direct the film over its 14-year production period. Fleischer comes after David O'Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, Shawn Levy, and Dan Trachtenberg were all expected to direct the film at one point or another. The film marks the debut feature production for Sony's PlayStation Productions and is the first Naughty Dog video game to be adapted into a film.

‘Uncharted' follows experienced treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) as he recruits a cunning Nathan ""Nate"" Drake (Tom Holland) to recover a hefty fortune, known as Magellan's Gold, once thought lost by the House of Moncada. The duo must race Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs to the infamous fortune, Moncada works with Jo Braddock (‘Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' star Tati Gabrielle) to bring Nate and Sully down. The treasure-hunting pair are joined by fellow treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (‘The Wilds' star Sophia Ali). Will they learn to work together in order to solve some of the world's oldest mysteries or will they clash?

Considering ‘Uncharted' is a film that doesn't require powerhouse performances, Tom Holland manages to give a strong performance throughout, accompanied by an adequate performance from Mark Wahlberg. The A-List pair have great chemistry, consistently bouncing off each other's witty quips from a script penned by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. Holland effortlessly takes on Nathan Drake's suave, tough demeanour, his portrayal feels like a complete 180 from Holland's turn as nerdy webslinger Peter Parker. Solid performances from Tati Gabrielle, Sophia Ali and Antonio Banderas round out the star-studded cast. Nolan North, who voices Drake in the ‘Uncharted' games, makes a quick cameo in the film - as Chloe and Nate tell him about their explosive adventures, he replies ""Something like that happened to me once""

Despite being one of the few video game adaptations that doesn't crash and burn into a pile of hot garbage, ‘Uncharted' still suffers with its share of issues. The film's pacing is all over the place, the first act seems to whizz by, but the rest of the film feels much slower. ‘Uncharted' also isn't exactly the most memorable film, apart from its iconic source material, this isn't a film that will stay in your head for weeks after you watch it. Even though it's a prequel to the games, fans of ‘Uncharted' will be please to know that the film incorporates elements from both ‘Uncharted 4: A Thief's End' and ‘Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception', the latter being referenced in the epic airplane sequence shown in the trailers. The film doesn't rely on these massive set pieces though, impressive fight choreography is scattered throughout and makes ‘Uncharted' all the more exciting and action packed.

Fans of the series will also be pleased to discover that ‘Uncharted's two post credit scenes more-or-less confirm a sequel to this film, with an important character reveal and a look into another one of Nate and Sully's globetrotting adventures. ‘Eternals' and ‘Game of Thrones' composer Ramin Djawadi creates a score that encompasses the film's action, and emotion, to create a score that perfectly accompanies the tone of ‘Uncharted'.

Ruben Fleischer's adaptation of the renowned video game franchise is an action-packed affair that offers great performances from the entire cast, entertaining action, and a hilarious friendship between Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland. ‘Uncharted' is a film the whole family can enjoy whether you're a fan of the games or just simply looking for an exciting watch. Tom Holland is thoroughly enjoyable in the leading role and Mark Wahlberg and Co aren't far behind."
"Feb 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Its a dumb but enjoyeble movie
"Feb 10, 2023",POSITIVE,"Does a great job of portraying the game characters, people need to remember this is a prequel to the first game! Hopeful for a second!"
"Feb 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Tom Holland delivers a remarkable performance outside of Spider-Man. I think he has not given the credit. He deserves as an actor, outside of the MCU. This was actually not a bad movie, it had some bad moments that lead into some bad decisions. But at the end of the day it was a decent enough movie that is definitely deserves a sequel, and it should continue on and develop Tom Holland's career."
"Feb 9, 2023",NEGATIVE,You got to get a little bit of popcorn and feel connected at how awesome it is. Absolutely attention getting. Not over done. 
"Feb 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,Probably the worse movie with Mark Wahlberg I have seen
"Feb 4, 2023",POSITIVE,This was an amazing movie from beginning to end. I hope we get a sequel to this movie soon.
"Feb 1, 2023",POSITIVE,"45 minutes into the movie the movie finally catches up with its teaser opener. Uncharted has everything a treasure hunt movie ought to have. It's smart without seeming to try too hard and there is plenty of adventure and thrilling combat. Although at times it did leave me wondering how an orphaned bartender who has a penchant for picking pockets acquired the ability to parkour off of cargo plane parcels in midair and to skillfully battle the bad guys with centuries old swords, I would have been disappointed if our heroes couldn't battle with the best of them. However, I wish the writers would have offered the audience a backstory explaining where Drake was able to practice his physical feats. I was able to believe that he was uniquely intelligent, but the stunts he performed required training. Another point of contention was the fact that they asked us to buy into charters story lines that ended up going no where. My only assumption is that they were setting up characters for a longer story line that stretches beyond this movie, but that has yet to be seen. Tom Holland feels like he has finally grown into a mature and seasoned action adventure star with this film. Over all,  this is a great escapist movie for those hungry to suspend their belief. The locals are exotic, the pacing is heat pounding and the story line leaves you ready for more. I'm sure a sequel isn't far behind."
"Jan 29, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I almost liked it - thanks to some wild visuals and Tom Holland's performance, where he sincerely earns his place as leading man. Dude tried to liven up a VERY dead script and brought a salvagable level of edge-of-your-seat intensity to this very shallow adventure. To the film's credit,  the action does lean into its game-based roots with a few impressive sequences which pay off in an absurd, entirely impossible way...so while the result is not the worst, it's a undoubtedly a terrible waste of good casting and talent. In a story where noone is deep enough to root for, Holland's lines  are delivered well but serve nearly exclusively to express surprise or explain the obvious. Wahlberg's character does next to nothing except shout at everyone else to hurry up, stop doing this or that, or other entirely unlikable things - a painfully low-effort performance from an actor who could well have met Holland beat for beat, but just grates instead. Antonio Banderas as the villain could have been brilliant if he had any significant screen-time - honestly, just skip to the finale where (spoiler alert) a flying set of treasure-laden pirate ships are picked up and flown through the air by helicopters in an airborne prepare-to-be-boarded showdown. Yes, I'm serious."
"Jan 27, 2023",POSITIVE,"Love this movie and game, thank you so much Sony"
"Jan 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,if you like watching something to fill your time and not pay any attention to it or fall asleep and not care what happened it is a great movie for you watching this is like eating sand acting was awful filled with plot holes and predictable twists great use of CGI you can visibly see it whenever it is used this would be great to use in interactions everyone would admit to their crimes just to never have to see this movie
"Jan 24, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Me parece una terrible adaptación del videojuego, aburrida, plana y con un final terrible, sin duda es mejor jugar al vídeojuego"
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"É um bom filme de aventura que lembra um pouco Tintim! Gostei, vale a pena ver.."
"Jan 19, 2023",POSITIVE,loved it wanted it to be longer
"Jan 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"it was entertaining, i liked it and recommend it. 
i havent played the game though, so not sure if they have done the game any justice, but i dont care i watched it as a film and as a film it was pretty good. kinda similar to national treasure, or Indiana jones which the game probably wanted to be. thinking on it, and thinking of all the failed tomb raider films, this is actually a damn good game based film really, not many films based on games turn out this decent."
"Jan 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"If you're looking for a mindless, predictable, and silly thriller... this is your movie!"
"Jan 19, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Like National Treasure, but without any entertainment value whatsoever and actors who couldn't possibly be giving less of an effort."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's what you'd expect, large set pieces and funny banter. It's silly and plot is off the wall but I don't think I will forget the last fight it's just amazing with helicopters racing around carrying old wooden ships."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The acting and writing are solid, however when It comes to a a accurate adaptation of   the video game, it's the definition of mid."
"Jan 17, 2023",POSITIVE,As a fan of the video games I'm happy with the outcome even though the story made some unnecessary changes.
"Jan 17, 2023",NEGATIVE,Just play the damn game
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's fun, and completely standard issue.  There's nothing unique here, but there's nothing badly done about it either. Worth a watch"
"Jan 16, 2023",POSITIVE,"Video gamers have their own tests regarding this adaptation, especially should it comparably fall into the same category alongside most other videogame-to-screen adaptations, but casual viewers are in for a fun yet familiar, well-casted ride with its own tricks, minimal thrills, charm and enough engagement to qualify a second round. (B+)"
"Jan 16, 2023",NEGATIVE,Rubbish nothing like that game poor casting
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,Fun silly movie. Not much more to say.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,great adaption of this franchise.
"Jan 15, 2023",POSITIVE,"Unfortunately, I went into uncharted with a bit of a preconceived notion based on other opinions I had read. That being said, as a fan of the game series I watched it with an open mind. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. It was a fun treasure hunting movie with a simple, yet serviceable story. The settings were good, and the scenes didn't overstay their welcome. However, as much as I like Tom Holland, I feel like he relied a little too heavily on the ""nervous energy"" thing that he has with Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Regardless, I enjoyed the movie. And the mid/post-credit scenes leave me wanting a sequel!"
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun to watch, but as all movies based on video games, there's already a great story to use, but the execution falls short. Lackluster special effects were noticeable during great sequences.
But still. A blast to watch!
Hoping for Uncharted 2, would be great to see the story unfold."
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,Can't say much when it comes to the games but as a adventure movie it was solid. Had one part that had me on the edge of my seat. Wished they showed more of the gold.
"Jan 13, 2023",POSITIVE,"Not as good as I expected, but it's fun and enjoyable."
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,What a fun ride. Grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy the action.
"Jan 12, 2023",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this one, great movie & great cast with a storyline that keeps you engaged. I enjoyed the journey to Spain and through the streets of ancient artifacts & history plus the elements of danger with 2 teams fighting for the same prize of gold. I look forward to the next installment"
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great popcorn movie just check your mind at the door and enjoy the show and try not to think to much.
"Jan 11, 2023",POSITIVE,"Knew nothing about the video game, but this movie stands on it's own. Great cast, keeps you engrossed and guessing. Loved it!"
"Jan 10, 2023",POSITIVE,A solid 4stars. What to not liking both actors and the journey they took us till the end. I hope they will produce Uncharted 2 soon.
"Jan 10, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Lazy, contrived, and generic writing. Complete cash-grab without proper development of plot or characters. The one saving grace is the actual treasure hunt is enjoyable, but the lack of effective character development really hinders how much you can enjoy this."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I had low expectations for this. Tom Holland did not look like a good fit.
However, I was surprised.
Decent movie, entertaining, good action sequences."

"Jan 8, 2023",POSITIVE,Wasnt sure about this movie but it was a good watch. Great storyline and the actors really mesh well together.
"Jan 7, 2023",NEGATIVE,"I was a bit excited at the very start of the game. It's Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg for the cast, and it's a movie remake of the game Uncharted. I still had the enery to watch it at first, but later on I found it rather boring. It's a very average treasure hunting movie. It does have some intense moments, but the flow of the movie just cannot keep you going. It looks a bit more like a National Treasure remake to me than a copy of the game. I found it less interesting and what on is with the falling out of the plane scene? The CGI is so fake and it literally goes against the LAW OF PHYSICS! It's so fucking ridiculous In conclusion, it's such a big disappointment and they could have added more spicies to it."
"Jan 5, 2023",NEGATIVE,"Nuda. Źle dobrani aktorzy, bezbarwne postacie, brak emocji w dialogach. Słaby humor. Gwałci inteligencje widza na każdym kroku. Jestem zdegustowany i urażony :("
"Jan 5, 2023",POSITIVE,"it was an actual decent movie, the casting itself I don't really like. being a big uncharted fan it was actually good. very tense, wondering what's going to happen next. I cannot wait for the 2nd one, IF they're getting one."
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Pełne klisz i Hollywoodzkiej prostoty jednak przygodę ogląda się przyjemnie a relacja Drake'a oraz Sully'iego to coś niesamowitego. Szkoda, że antagonista kuleje"
"Jan 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I mean this film doesnt feel original and honestly i did not expect it to be, i expected it to me a entertaining and fun film, and honestly, i had a good time. Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are pretty great in the move and have some great chemistry, the rest of the characters i didnt care that much for, i thought it was kinda lazy to just let her go to wrong coordinates and the villain is not that interesting. The setpiece of the finally is insane, the VFX team went crazy on it and the locations are pretty great. I thought that the action was really well done, mainly because i was so interest to see, when Tom was doing his own stunts and when a stunt actor took over. Uncharted was a fun movie and did his job for me atleast, also this movie made me more appreciate Tom Holland as one of my favorite young actors working today."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,"The movie was over the top, absurd and 100% unbelievable. That's everything a video game is. This being based on a video game it was perfect. Even the final scenes felt like a true boss battle. 

Folks trashing this movie need to remember that this is entertainment and not every scene filmed needs to be pursuing an Oscar."
"Jan 4, 2023",POSITIVE,Really enjoyable movie. Super fun.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEGATIVE,Caught up on my emails watching this. Braddock was a joke. Hate the trope where they follow a long convoluted path to find something out in the open. Or finish a long quest where the exit is somewhere very public.
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, Uncharted might be familiar, but it's still a fun time for newcomers to the series or those seeking a whole new adventure on-screen. Uncharted is packed with fun action sequences and witty moments, especially between Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. Hardcore fans might find this prequel comes with minor disappointments, but in the end, the opportunity of greater things could come to the characters we love in future. Uncharted is certainly a film that doesn't change the world of cinema.  Still, without a doubt, it provides a stunning level of brainless adventure and entertainment."
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,"i realize i'm probably giving this a much higher rating than most, but i had fun watching this movie! it was reminiscent of national treasure (but obviously not as good due to the lack of nic cage) and i'm always down for a slightly absurd adventure movie. 

my cast critiques (meaning only two actors):
- mark wahlbergs character was kinda useless and i could have done without him, but what are you gonna do.
- tom holland is yet another tight lipped, male , british action hero, and i'm totally here for it."
"Jan 3, 2023",POSITIVE,Very true to the game series and entertaining to watch. It was actually better than I was expecting it to be.
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"This movie reminded me of the kid in high school that thought he was way cooler than he was. He was mildly entertaining, but you never want to see him again."
"Jan 1, 2023",NEGATIVE,"It's okay, it leaves a lot to be desired since it's a movie based on a video game"
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,I really liked the adventure of it all.  Tom Holland is great at this genre.
"Dec 30, 2022",POSITIVE,Tom is such a cutie and Mark makes great movies. What a winning storyline and cast. Can't wait for part two!
"Dec 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Muito divertido e bobo, mais tem cenas de ação muito iradas, e referências a o jogo !"
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,action-packed and enjoyable watch with great acting and visuals. some historical and scientific inaccuracies. a lot of fun. cool stunts and banter that doesn't flop. don't expect characterizations to be like the games.
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,Spiderman once in a different way ) I liked the adventure!
"Dec 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"it was fine, kinda left me disappointed. i expected a little more from this movie."
"Dec 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,Overall very disappointing movie.
"Dec 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"If you love the videogames probably you won't enjoy the movie. But, if you are looking for something to watch in two hours you won't get bored. The film is actually not bad, Holland's acting skills are amezing, even if he's not the best option to play Nathan Drake in my opinion. Still there are a lot of defect, scene that don't have a logical sense. 
So, in the end, I enjoyed the movie, but I'm not going to see it again"
"Dec 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"This movie is such a good time. Im a huge fan of the games and tbh they are not entirely faithful to the games, but I think they still created a fun movie and captured enough of the essence of the games for me not to be salty."
"Dec 17, 2022",POSITIVE,Really good.  Fun movie with some humor.  Really unique action scenes which are hard to come by in these type of action movies.  Lead actors were also entertaining.
"Dec 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie, being a huge fan of the games I felt it was an amazing adaptation. 
Though it was hard at first though as I was trying to compare it to the games, but once I was able to let it be it's own story it had my heart."
"Dec 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Typical mid 80s plot, stunts underwhelmed by green screen, poor FX. Nothing exciting there. Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland playing themselves….  Maybe better on a big screen ."
"Dec 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Aside from a very stupid finale, this is a good-hearted action flick. I'd rank it right alongside National Treasure as a fun, daft adventure."
"Dec 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,Easy to watch for a fun family night. Nothing new or glamorous.
"Dec 13, 2022",POSITIVE,Great all around movie. Lots of fun and great acting. Can’t wait for the potential sequel. It’s a fun adventure that takes you in and feels like you are apart of it. 
"Dec 11, 2022",POSITIVE,"Actually enjoyed the movie, it's a fun action flick. Does what you expect but nonetheless enjoyable."
"Dec 9, 2022",POSITIVE,"Indiana Jones type adventure and action with a twist, which of your partners can you really trust?  The pairing of Spider man and Father Stu actually worked out well."
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,A bit long but a lot of fun with some absolutely incredible action scenes.
"Dec 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great film. Lots of moments felt like the computer game. OTT , silly and lots of fun. Hope they make a sequel. I believe it made a profit and audience appreciation is much higher than so-called professional criticism, which shows how out of touch they can be."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"There's always time for a chat, even when falling from an airplane. I quickly got tired of the the nonstop, bickering and clever remarks. It's so hard to get invested in the movie because nothing is serious. Nothing matters because everything is a joke."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,uncharted is a fun silly movie but it also mid - Decent 5/10
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Plenty of action and a good cast.  Great effects.  In the end it just left me shrugging my shoulders and saying ""meh"""
"Dec 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wooden acting, no characterisation, cliche moments throughout… another really bad computer game to film adaption."
"Nov 29, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I am a big fan of action adventure movies, but I was unimpressed through most of Uncharted. The 4 minute backstory of Nathan and his brother is literally the only attempt made at character depth and development throughout the entire movie. Remember Indiana Jones' deathly fear of snakes? His sexual chemistry with the ladies?  His struggle to face his own inner demons?? Well, Uncharted offers none of that. We are given no opportunity for depth, connection, or chemistry with these characters, and they have none with one another. After the first 5 minutes, flatly stacked dialog connecting impossible action scenes and awkward interactions is all you're gonna get. Aside from a missing brother and greed, no motivations or purpose are established for any of the characters. The characters' level of excitement, fear, surprise, or intrigue is all but missing in what should be a heart-pounding and thrilling adventure for all of them. Romances are hinted at--one past and one potential–yet ZERO sexual tension is ever built in the movie.  By the time we get to the Peter Pan meets Wreck it Ralph ship scene in the sky, we have been expected to suspend reality and logic with so many ""what the–?"" moments and eye roll sequences, that the movie is truly unredeamable in my book. I actually love these actors outside of this movie, but sadly, Uncharted does not display their talents."
"Nov 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Pretty good action movie. Not bad but not amazing.
"Nov 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie, but nothing original."
"Nov 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,What plagues this movie is generic villains and plots. What brings up this movie is Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg's performances and their chemistry made me want more.
"Nov 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Could have been a grand adventure, instead is really a tale of betrayal from unlikable characters. Waste."
"Nov 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"A little predictable, but a great action movie with a great cast. Liked it a lot and I hope they make a sequel"
"Nov 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,Movie is good before the last mission to the treasure.  Great opening with cutscene to the jumping from plane screen at the end. Storyline is good with balance contribution from key characters. Good introduction and role combination of each characters. Many Small surprises along the movie. After key villain died on plane then the movie becomes sucked. Not make sense to risk valuable things then turn out to be nothing.
"Nov 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,Great to watch when you're bored.
"Nov 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,Not like the video game but it's okay
"Nov 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good movie, but could have been better. I am being generous with five stars."
"Nov 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Special Effects: 0,5/Sound Effects: 1,0/Acting: 0,5/Story: 1,0"
"Nov 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's unfortunate that this got cast in the way that it did, with the right cast this probably could have been a lot stronger. Holland is just basically playing a snarkier Peter Parker here. And I'm not buying the connection that him and Wahlberg share so quickly. It's underdeveloped, but with a couple of actors that shared better chemistry that wouldn't have been a problem. Because aside from that it's a fairly mediocre adventure movie. Lots of big spectacular set pieces, but they're all pretty hollow. It's a fun enough movie, but with better performers (for these roles) it could have been something really solid."
"Nov 14, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Horrible script - it started off ok with a good premise but went downhill as the movie wore on.  It was too far-fetched for a 'realistic' type movie.  You can accept that in something like Pirates of the Caribbean but not in a James Bond-type movie.  It was just too unrealistic with terrible plot twists and dialog.  Mark Wahlberg is typically one of my favorites, but this movie was painful to finish."
"Nov 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's hard to call a movie Uncharted, when the most uncharted place they go to is a Papa Johns."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not good. Why did we have two keys again? Can you never again do that thing with two boats shooting each other by being carried aloft by helicopters that can't ever possibly lift them.. K, THX."
"Nov 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,So far fetched it’s not believable. Poor at best. It’s a Indiana Jones wanna be
"Nov 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Nahhh.. they just tried to mash up a lot of adventure movies like tomb raider, Indiana Jones, national treasure an make a movie. 
It was good - but if a movie reminds you of a lot of other movies - then it's not necessarily a good movie - it's just a copy. They even tried to emulate spiderman-esque stunts for Holland. Plus the helicopter boat stunt was totally unbelievable - maybe someone should have pointed out that a wooden vessel subjected to decades of decay would break the moment it's lifted by helicopter using chains/wire."
"Nov 11, 2022",POSITIVE,This is a good action packed movie and a a video game adaptation of uncharted action is what it is required it is good
"Nov 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,There should be  a genre COMPUTER GAME TYPE. This one imitates a c.game while viewers like me is not prone to watching it.
"Nov 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The movie starts off on the most overhyped sequence that was used for its marketing milking that scene out for its fan to watch the film taking away it's spectacle when watching it even though the scene is just like the video game. Not only that but a backstory on [Nathan Drake] forgetting that we actually have played the younger version of [Nathan Drake] fully immersing ourselves into the story giving a more emotional impact into the character which seeing the same thing in the movie wasn't as emotional because you have already seen it but actually experience it. But now we get a whole movie based on the less younger version of [Nathan Drake].
I don't know how to explain this...When you watch the movie, to don't see the character but you only see the actors for themselves. When I saw the character Sully I don't see the character at all, he was supposed to be someone who you immediately get that figure of guidance, someone who is the one that will guide [Nathan Drake] rationally but both of them is the same, very talkative and clustered with nothing babbling comedy rather than having smart comedic dialogue. To sum it up, they tried to fit the actors Instead of the actors trying to fit the characters. 

This movie is more for people who have actually never played Uncharted before. Everything is based on meeting the characters that's was have seen before, now actually just seen but played as. Yes we know the orphanage, yes we know his brother we gave the full story on him, yes we have met Sully in the game, why is the story based on as if it's the very first time we seeing all of this. I still feel as if [Nathan Drake] and [Victor Sullivan] is based off Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg and not the other way around. This movie felt like it had no depth when it came to being emotional, it's so emotional that when Drake found out what happened to his brother became the most emotional scene in the entire movie then it just stayed bleak throughout. 
The puzzles in this movie was literally turning keys, nothing felt smart and intelligent, the puzzles in the game was long, silent and sometimes wanted to make you rage quit, it's literally the most important part of [Uncharted], the moving vehicles is the most important part which this movie lacked of, that air sequence doesn't count. 
This movie doesn't really embody the game, you can already see they just wanted a action packed blockbuster without any intelligence in its story. Funny thing is that I felt more excited watching the fan film of [Uncharted] than this.
And do they even have a plan for sequels? Don't give us an end credit scene unless you actually have a plan for a sequel! Why couldn't the whole movie be like the end credit scene, no explanation, no origin story just a full out mission as if it's one their regular missions like in the game."
"Nov 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Passably good for a video game movie.  Very predictable but fun none the less.
"Nov 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Nice adventure movie with slightly too many completely unrealistic scenes. But it is something to watch.
"Nov 6, 2022",POSITIVE,Great action movie.KRT
"Nov 5, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a good, fun action movie."
"Nov 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,Soooo predictable. Why are the writers in Hollywood  so bad these days? No creativity. They tried too decrease stupidity but with not much success.
"Nov 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Badly written, badly directed. The only thing that drives this movie forward is ridiculous coincidences where the bad guy is always in the right place at the right time looking in the right direction. And that main villain, man, maybe she can scare Sully's cat if she tries really hard."
"Nov 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"I liked all the action. The cast was amazing and love the duo chemistry with Mark and Tom. I can't wait for the next one! Can't wait to see Tati Gabrielle in another movie too! I enjoy action, treasure hunting movies especially with Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland. I was very surprised to see Antonio Banderas in this movie and as always he makes a good bad guy, but I like him in comedy roles more.  When is the next Unchartered coming out? Will there be another one?"
"Nov 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This adaptation of the game is a bit weak. Despite the efforts of the actors (I don't know if Tom Holland was the best fit for the protagonist, but that's my opinion) and the quality of the CGI, the title is misleading and deviates from the main purpose of the game."
"Nov 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Movie made by kids, for kids. The only thing that pisses me off, is the fact that Holland plays the exact same character as Peter Parker in MCU..."
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,Truly awful. The film-makers have basically tried to combine National Treasure with Imdiana Jones with as many big greenscreen set pieces as they can and the result is a complete mess with massive plot holes improbably papered over. PS a note to the makers - helicopters can't do that. They just can't. Oh and how did the ships get in that hole in the first place. And gravity also appears to have been overlooked. I could go on but you get the picture. Awful.
"Oct 31, 2022",NEGATIVE,"When you have played the games, the movie feels like a bad scenario based on them. The characters are way different than those we have gotten used to. The whole back story and plot is changed, but in a worst way. Two hours without enough action or adventure. They could have put more effort."
"Oct 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,As huge fan of the games it was always going to be a hard sell. Uncharted feels like a generic adventure film. it is woefully miscast and didnt feel like Uncharted but... I had fun and hope they make more. There I said it.
"Oct 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,Did not expect much from this one but I do think its one of the better video game movies and for the most part they do a good job in capturing Nathan and the Uncharted games. Also love the cameo from Nolan North
"Oct 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was way to fast paced to the point where I didn't even know what was happening most of the time. It felt like it had nothing to do with the 4 uncharted games with Nathan Drake
"Oct 29, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fantastic video game movie,  started out and continued exactly as expected and awesome performances by the cast. Yes the dialogue is cheesy at some points but what vide9 games dont have cheesy dialogue"
"Oct 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"REALLY GOOD! Action packed and every character was intresting. Plot was awesome! The plane scene where Nathan was hanging on to the box, was crazy!"
"Oct 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,It's a forced acting of the unpredictable world of uncharted. It completely missed the point of story and focused more on the parkour and knife fighting. Truly disappointed.
"Oct 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"After seeing Uncharted I say we don't need a reset button for the action-adventure movie genre, we need a shut up button for Matthew Pejkovic (creator of the site Matt's Movie Reviews (original I know *sarcasm*)) and all of the other bribed, scheming and slogging critics that in many cases don't even watch the movies they review; they have the singular goal of killing fun for you and your family. I will tell you the untold truth of uncharted it is a lightning in a bottle that Ruben Fleischer will doubtfully catch again. Exploring the mystical world of: New York City, a Paris like place that I don't remember the name of and The Philippines was a true delight because I don't leave the house often due to my career as being a critic in training for Rotten Tomatoes. The character interactions between Drake and Sully are incredibly humorous and sophisticated as any two stylish thieves should be. The villain characters are cold and calculated with backup plan after backup plan sure to keep the heroes on their toes. This movie gets an incredibly high score for creating a complex but easy to follow narrative, I would give it a 5.5/5 stars if I could WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Uncharted is all about adventure, yes but it is also about unpredictability and other spicy ingredients. The movie was predictable and cliche and delivered a tasteless dish."
"Oct 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"I don't get critics, they seem to think every movie should be a soaring masterpiece and never seem to think that a movie can be just enjoyable escapism - and Uncharted is no exception. Kind of a poor man's Indiana Jones but not really poor at all, I found it a blast! Wahlberg and Holland have a great chemistry and play off each other very well.
An enjoyable waste of time and I hope there's a sequel, there is certainly scope for it"
"Oct 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Um filme bom é divertido atores atimos... porém não achei tão fiel a o jogo atores nem um pouco parecido aos dos game nem as vozes, um vídeo bom pra assitir nu final de tarde mais não pra reunir os amigos para ficar animados até o fim."
"Oct 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Like ""National Treasure"" minus N.Cage & a semblance of rationality or fun."
"Oct 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Filme empolgante e bem realizado para o gênero.
"Oct 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It was fun! Not a huge gamer, so cannot compare it to the source material, which apparently worked in my favor for liking the movie."
"Oct 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Filme bom, e ""Até"" bem adaptado, Tom Holland nesse filme está espetacular, mas infelizmente não tem a cara para ser o icônico Nathan Drake, e a ideia de juntar os dois primeiros jogos em um só filme é horrível, além de que o vilão não é nem um pouco carismático, 2,5 de 5."
"Oct 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,The writing and adventures can't be compared to the games but by itself the movies is good but not as cinematic or enjoyable as some of the games (also why is Nathan Tom Holland if he's alchoholic? That's not even in the games).
"Oct 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A fairly fun mix of action & comedy. It's an enjoyable story whether or not you've played the games. The post credits scenes certainly make it look like a sequel will be made and I liked it well enough to want to see more, so hopefully that comes to fruition. It's got a somewhat similar feel to the National Treasure movies, but with a bit more action and violence. If you liked those, then you'll probably be entertained by this one."
"Oct 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The video games were bad so I don't know why anyone expected this movie to be amazing but it was an ok time, nothing much to complain about other than at times it got boring. Good characters and Tom Holland is still incredibly hot"
"Oct 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,Palomera la pelicula
"Oct 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Promisingly cast but misleadingly titled, Uncharted mines its bestselling source material to produce a disappointing echo of superior adventure films."
"Oct 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Tom Holland is charming and comedic, action packed movie!"
"Oct 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Sorry is generic, and map is inaccurate due to the nine-dash line on the map in China, which greatly upset the people of South east asia, from Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and ASEAN countries"
"Oct 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,Funny action movie that didnt take itself too seriously.  Cast did a great job with the acting and the plot was good enough.  I wasn't expecting Ben Hur.  I was looking to turn my brain off for about 90 minutes and laugh.  That's what I got.
"Oct 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"Simply exciting and attractive story. All characters were good, especially Tom Holland, he must be a necessary role in this movie."
"Oct 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Uncharted was perfectly predictable. I had a general idea of what to expect going into the film and got most of everything I wanted. While it is not groundbreaking cinema, it does offer so very great action set pieces that are pulled straight from the games I grew up loving. The story is very reminiscent of an adventure Nathan Drake would take during the games and the environments were diverse and engaging. My one big critique is the performances. While they were fine, I did not really think the casting was done in terms of the characters themselves but more for the star power. Tom Holland plays a character that is an edgier Peter Parker, he still has the charisma of Nathan Drake but there is something about him that still feels naïve and less sure of himself. I understand this is early in Nathan Drake's career, but it still felt to overly Spider-Man for me. There is really not much to say for Mark Wahlberg either, he plays pretty much the same character as every one of his other films. Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas all do a fine enough job in their roles but never do anything that make their performances stand out. Overall, this movie is fun if you sit back, relax and enjoy some great action and exploration. It is not great, but it definitely passes the time and is good time.

Score: 68%
Verdict: Good"
"Oct 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Sadly Nathan Fillion won't get his movie but 
As a buddy Comedy it's really fun and now I need more Tom and mark
5/10"
"Oct 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This movie was disappointing, I expected more from this movie dont get me wrong the movie as a good story but the way it's portraited made it bad.there was also some moments off confusion like the boat fight scene the door would disappear and reappear. I would probably not recommend this movie to anyone in particular."
"Oct 15, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I liked the movie, but from someone who loves the games, I thought it fell short of being as amazing as the games and the casting choices were strange. I’m up for another one though. Hopefully they go forward in the timeline a little and show us something really cool. This one felt like a mashup of the different scenes from the games and I felt like it didn’t fit together very well. Looking forward to see what’s next. "
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,Nice action scenes I've never seen before. Funny conversations.
"Oct 15, 2022",POSITIVE,probably my faviroute film (even though ive played none of the games) its got a god plot its playstation its funny with good characters its playstation most of the time the action never really stops...its playstation- YES IM BIASED
"Oct 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Okay. I played the games. So Here is my HONEST review: 6.5/10 
Is it worth watching? No, but it's still fun. 
Tom Holland was okay at the role. To be honest they should have the movie with Amy Hennig's Permission, because it is her characters to begin with. Tom as a younger Nathen Drake overall was okay. Chloe did great. Also Sully needed to be older. 
But please don't blame the cast ; it was the story that was missing."
"Oct 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This is bad. Just as a movie alone it's really boring. I love the four games of Uncharted, they give me so much emotion. I need to take a look at Lost Legacy, seems decent. This was really boring, just mimicking puzzles from the game that might seem interesting to play, but are boring to watch. The set pieces were not very exciting for me, but might be for others. I know some of my friends enjoyed it. I just felt very little emotion watching the movie. Also, I did not see Nathan or Sully in the film, but I did see Tom Holland and Mark Walberg. The girl who played Chloe did seem a bit like Chloe so kudos to her."
"Oct 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A fun action movie with some truly talented actors!  They kept it exciting the entire time.  Some action movies can get boring because we've seen it all before.  Uncharted was never dull, it kept me entertained the entire time."
"Oct 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,"As a movie, it's not that bad but as it relates to the source material (the video games) it's awful. I played Uncharted 4 a couple years ago and loved it, have since played it a few more times. I have no experience with the first three but even with my experience with 4 I could tell, this movie has none of the charm of the games and overall it felt bland and boring. Way too much ""relatable"" humor and nothing really mattered. The better part of the movie didn't even take place in lush, jungle settings like I was used to seeing in the game. I never write movie reviews but I felt compelled to right one for this movie. Another piece of media ruined by companies that only want to pump out cash-grab movies."
"Oct 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,Too much backstabs waiting for the end form the beginning... failed to execute the plot and just not enough story just backstabs
"Oct 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,Bubblegum entertainment for sure-a freebie on Prime and that is all it is worth.
"Oct 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just rewatch raiders or National treasure, this is fun good and terrible all at the same time."
"Oct 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,it is a harmless forgettable adventure movie that has a miscast lead but is not boring
"Oct 6, 2022",POSITIVE,It's a good movie.  The actors and the characters are enjoyable. The story is decent.  Fans of the video game will love it.  People who like action/adventure will enjoy it also.  It's better than average.
"Oct 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,Could have been fantastic but such a poorly delivered work despite some of the actors giving it their all. Walhberg is insufferable & a genuine put off; another casting would've carried the role better
"Oct 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Good action flick...
"Oct 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,A diferencia de otras peliculas basadas en videojuegos esta se puede ver y te entretiene
"Oct 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,"My lord this is terrible. All the actors completely phoned in their performances, the movie is boring and slow, CGI looks awful, script is bad. Not worth your time at all. Not even entertaining in a cheesy blockbuster way, just dead-eyed performances, cliche' script, and a bad movie."
"Oct 4, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a fun action comedy with a very lovable ""Indiana Jones"" vibe!"
"Oct 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Pretty good movie. What say it again but there's something lacking. Don't know what it is just yet we'll have to watch it again to see if my feelings stay the same or change.
"Oct 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I've never played the video game so I can't compare it to that. Uncharted doesn't go into uncharted waters with this movie; it has a lot of the same beats as Dan Brown books, National Treasure, etc... but It's worth a watch. Tom Holland basically plays Spiderman and Mark Walberg plays himself."
"Oct 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,This movie just isn't very good.
"Oct 1, 2022",POSITIVE,"Excelente y entretenida, lo disfruta toda la familia."
"Oct 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Horrible, so stupid, BAD BAD BAD"
"Oct 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Tom Holland alla performance peggiore della carriera; non studia minimamente il personaggio e si limita ad usare il suo classico fascino giovanile per dare vita ad uno Spider Man senza costume in giro per il mondo; stesso discorso valido per Mark Walhberg, personaggio piuttosto noioso e monotono.
La parte grafica sicuramente è spettacolare e divertente, poco rallentata da futili dialoghi che visto il poco successo dei personaggi sarebbero stati doppiamente dannosi.
Ormai in questi film di azione ad alto budget l'unica garanzia nella trama è che ogni personaggio tradirà e che tutto o quasi verrà perdonato; in questo caso meglio riusciti i villain."
"Oct 1, 2022",NEGATIVE,Si eres fan de uncharted lo mejor seria no ver la pelicula.
"Sep 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"Solid movie, Mark Wahlberg was a bit annoying though"
"Sep 30, 2022",NEGATIVE,Wow...I can not believe how bad this movie was!  You have top rated actors in a very poorly filmed/cheap production.  This movie was awful
"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,So refreshing to see male protagonists rather than the usual girls trying to prove how macho and hip they are. Dialogue was petty sharp too and good film score but of course searching for buried treasure is never going to be that amazing unless it's on an alien planet.
"Sep 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,Good movie but nothing special.
"Sep 28, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun movie! Sit back and enjoy the ride.
"Sep 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Enjoyable movie, great for kids and teens."
"Sep 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Mark Wahlberg's inability to actually sell me on the character he is portraying ruined this for me. I love action adventure and tried my hardest to not let his character get to me but it did. Still 3 stars, Tom holland and the overall adventure plot and execution was not bad."

"Sep 25, 2022",POSITIVE,"Must see movie based on a video game. Fun movie with a great cast, i really hate critic reviews they always seem like paid reviews and show nothing but bias. This is a fun family movie and I home we get to see Uncharted 2. Well done Sony."
"Sep 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I won't go as far as saying I hated it, but it was one if those ones that you feel like you've already seen 100 times when you're watching it for the first. There's maybe 2/3 really good action scenes in it and the rest of the time it feels fairly dull. I don't regret watching it, but I'm confident it's a movie you could stop watching for 20/30 minute sections at a time and still have the jist of what was going on when you came back to it."
"Sep 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Besides great actions sequences and exotic visuals, the film wants to achieve more than it has time and space for. Holland and Wahlberg have an okay performance, while the supporting cast just don't really come to play…"

"Sep 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was ok but Antonio Banderas' role could have been written better. I can't say more without spoiling it. The audio book version seems a little better and it's performed by the real Nathan Drake.... Nolan North.

"Sep 22, 2022",POSITIVE,really enjoyable adventure story.
"Sep 22, 2022",POSITIVE,I had no idea this movie would be this good! From beginning to end I was so into this film. I wish they would bring out more sequels.

"Sep 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's a fun movie,has action, suspenseful and funny. Whoever doesn't like it doesn't like the genre, because for action/adventure movies are not for everyone. This is adventure worth enjoying in my opinion."
"Sep 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It was ok. If you like watching people play video games, you will probably like this movie."
"Sep 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"Critic ratings are frivolous thought garbage. A movie can't have a good rating if it is simply entertaining, it must have meaning obviously….

This one has a meaning - it entertains if you are a fan of the games. No it doesn't follow any game plot, but the characters (especially for a prequel) are kept fairly true to how we know them and it's fun."
"Sep 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's was VERY boring mostly texting and dining out.. to be frank this movie was to appeal to the gamers but I've played the game and still dislike the movie, it needed a lot more work, felt just thrown together with minimal background music and just action scenes to fill in the boring gaps…. 2/10"
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie is entertaining, fun to watch and the over the top action in pure 90s style is kinda refreshing!"
"Sep 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"I can't imagine how the Critics came up with such a mediocre rating. ""Uncharted"" is right up there with the Indiana Jones and National Treasure series movies for excitement and adventure, and great special effects.  The ending seems to hint at a forthcoming sequel, so there's that to look forward to as well!  Can't wait!"
"Sep 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,Love the games. Bad casting decisions here.
"Sep 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,If passing the time is what you're looking for. This is it. Watch it once and never again.
"Sep 16, 2022",POSITIVE,"As a fan of the games, I've even met Nolan North (Nate) and Troy Baker (Sam), this movie was amazing. I greatly enjoyed watching a younger Nate and Sully brought to life by Tom Holland and Mark Walburg, they did a wonderful job. While their relationship wasn't quite what the games depicted it was still enjoyable. I hope to see a sequel or two made from this"
"Sep 13, 2022",NEGATIVE,"*Not even worth a chance.*

A real swill. 

Yet another movie that you need to have your common sense turned off to let all the inconsistencies inside pass you by. 

It has absolutely nothing to do with the game, they just used the name uncharted to mislead and get more reach. 

The casting is completely wrong. 

Just looking to exploit tom holland's time of fame."
"Sep 13, 2022",NEUTRAL,For the Tom Holland stans
"Sep 13, 2022",POSITIVE,"I'll rate any well done movie in the vein of Indiana Jones, National Treasure, etc. as 5/5. More please !"
"Sep 12, 2022",NEGATIVE,"I was hopeful, and then was let down. I did laugh at the real Nathan Drake cameo though."
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Oof. Barebly watchable. Had a few nice moments, and some nice CGI and EFX, but what a nonsensical plot and dialogue drivel. A waste of some acting talent. It's sort of as if one took the National Treasure franchise to the ultimate extreme of ridiculousness, and then tripled that! National Treasure was a fun romp. This was just silly, nonsensical, and painful to watch (though I forced myself to watch to the end. I'll never get that time back.)"
"Sep 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Uncharted is a fun popcorn summer movie. There is not a lot of brains here, but I enjoyed my time with it"
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Really bad story, really bad effects, very cliché but old and not good. I want my money back"
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It is hard to blame a franchise for not picking the exact lookalike actors matching the style for their video game characters (even though there would be plenty to say about it), but you can definitely blame a franchise for not sticking to its characters' developments. 

Uncharted is an underwhelming disappointment on many levels, and not only speaking for Uncharted ""fans"" but for the future of the franchise in general.

Nathan Drake is a treasure hunter, known for his great punchlines, charisma and ungodly physical capabilities. Tom Holland's version of Nathan Drake (or Ruben Fleischer's, to share the blame) is far from being close to the character development most people have been able to experience in the 4 titles video game: from a skateboard boy, Tom Holland shows a drunk, inexperienced Nathan Drake that seem to lack the rich treasure thief experience that Nathan Drake is supposed to have at his very young age. His word contractions get even noticable the more you hear it, not as articulate as the ""true"" Nate… Well, that can be side effects from the alcoholism.
Most people in favour of the scenario of the movie will argue that the movie was made to picture young Drake, which is not a bad idea. However, Nathan Drake has been stealing treasures in Museums of Carthagena when Tom Holland was stealing bracelets to young drunk girls in a Boston bar. Except for the plane scene, when the physics could be questioned (but won't be, as it wouldn't be fair), there is no actual parkour scene, for which Uncharted is well known for… Oh well, except for a bit of a run in a fountain in Barcelona… pity.

And that leads us to Sully (Victor Sullivan), who is, even at Drake's young age, a wise, trustworthy and opportunistic treasure hunter who would leave the hard physical stuff to his younger partner. Mark Wahlberg's version of Sully (or Ruben Fleischer's, again for similar reasons) gives in for a bulky, moustache-less badass who's MOTO seem to be stabbing everyone in the back just for a piece of gold. Heck, he can even climb into an helicopter and slap two guys in there. What a beast.

Jokes aside, Sully's character development is certainly the main reason why the Nate/Sully duo is just not working in Uncharted (the Movie). You have to keep in mind that both Sully and Nathan, even though hesitant toward each other at the very beginning of their relationships, still could be trusted and worked together perfectly. In Uncharted (the Movie), you just don't relate to Sully, or Drake for that matter, as there is no link/connection to make between the characters.

Finally, although there is plenty to say more, this leaves us with the scenario in general: They have just been mixing bits and pieces of all of the 4 games in one 2 hour movie, like there are no tomorrows. The creation of the multi-billionaire Spanish family seem unnecessary, with no meaning to the overall story line. 

The most satisfying moment in the movie was seeing Nolan North as guest star for a good 5 seconds, who is probably who we recognised more as Nate than Nate himself. 

Watching Uncharted is like waking up from a very bad hangover, where all the memories you have  are just extremely blurry. I was happy when I woke up from that hangover."
"Sep 11, 2022",NEGATIVE,ok but not that great though
"Sep 10, 2022",POSITIVE,I thought it was a good action movie. I would watch the movie again.
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This movie was pretty much what I expected or rather hoped for. It was a fun adventure/action rollercoaster plain and simple. This is one of those, rare nowadays, movies that are meant to entertain plain and simple. Two hours of adventure, action and twists barely held together by a rudimentary story and no woke rubbish or bullshit preaching. The latter is probably what rendered it a 40% rotten ""critics"" score on woke tomatoes while the audience gave it a 90% fresh score. As almost always a rotten score on woke tomatoes is an indication that it is a movie worthwhile watching.

The story, as can be seen from the movie blurb, is a treasure hunt a la Indiana Jones. It starts off by introducing the main character, Nathan, in a few brief scenes where Nathan bungles up a heist being perpetrated by his brother after which they are involuntarily separated.

Quick forward to present time and the main story takes off with Nathan being persuaded by Sullivan to embark on a hunt for an immeasurable treasure. Not exactly the newest or freshest of stories but if it works don't fix it.

Pretty much everyone in this movie is a self-centered scoundrel with little to no care for anyone except themselves. Thus the action and treasure hunting is regularly interrupted by twists and betrayals. No one will claim that this movie has an elaborate and intelligent story. It does not have to. It is just meant to hold the action together.

I quite liked the main actors. Sullivan did a good job of being the blasé, self-centered scoundrel, Nathan of being the somewhat naive wannabe treasure hunter and Braddock was quite cool, and sexy (hey, I'm a guy), as the baddie. Antonio Banderas was Antonio Banderas although I was saddened by his premature exit from the hunt.

Overall the action was nice although the scenes in, and out of, the airplane was the usual unrealistic Hollywood action. Although that was overshadowed with the ship carrying helicopter scenes towards the end which was taking unrealism to new levels. But I didn't really care because it was fun silliness. The moment they started to carry those ships away I started to hope that the writer would go for the silly and obvious stunt involving black powder. Yes unrealistic but there is no denying the coolness factor.

As far as I am concerned this was two hours well spent. The ending scene clearly suggested that the producers hoped to make a sequel. I would definitely watch it but with all the people lamenting the fact that someone dared to make a movie simply for entertainment without a profound (and boring) story or bullshit preaching in it that might not happen. It did make about four times its budget at the box office though so maybe."
"Sep 10, 2022",POSITIVE,"Completely impressed! Which is rare coming from someone who played all the games. It's difficult to replicate Nolan North's and the rest of the cast's charisma, but this film does a good job of establishing a great prequel to the games. The cast was great and the film was a mix between the games and a classic Indy-like adventure. Hell, it's even better than Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. I sure hope they keep it as a series. We desperately need more adventure movies."
"Sep 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Creo que fue bastante entretenida, si no le prestas atención a los diálogos y te dejas llevar por la aventura estoy seguro que está película te va a encantar."
"Sep 9, 2022",POSITIVE,Muito bom filme sessão da tarde total
"Sep 9, 2022",NEGATIVE,nobody wanted this movie
"Sep 8, 2022",NEGATIVE,"No adult thought went into the writing or directing of this movie. Nonsense from start to finish. Tom Holland plays a thief who is somehow passed off as a ""good guy."" People who hold down a job but still steal from customers are not good guys, and anyone who thinks so is a degenerate imbecile. The action is so preposterous, and the gaps in logic and plot and, most of all, basic physics, so moronic, that it's easy to throw up your hands and just quit watching. For example, no helicopter in the world can even come close to lifting an 85-ton ship out of the water, and anyone who thinks it can (sorry, Ruben Fleisher, Rafe Judkins, and the rest) is, again, a complete imbecile.  Then there is the scene where a character appears on the scene and magically divines that two specific other characters are flying that helicopter, when she has no reaon whatsoever to believe they (a) have access to a helicopter, or (b) know how to fly it.  Then there is (spoiler here) contractor who murders her boss but somehow manages to command the loyalty of everyone in the entire gigantic corporation he owned without anyone asking any questions.  There are also the magic entrances to caves, Tom Holland wearing no shirt for no particular reason, but later diving into an underwater cave without taking off a stitch of clothing.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  Trash."
"Sep 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Uncharted is an entertaining, fun movie that serves to pass the time.
However, it has somewhat absurd and clichéd situations, where the story is not at all original and feels like it has been done many times. 
Tom Holland and Mark Walberg are great in the main roles, the rest of the characters are quite forgettable and some were wasted (Antonio Banderas)
 Without a doubt, if you don't have high expectations, and you don't know the source material, you will surely enjoy this movie."
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Light entertainment. Wahlberg and Holland interaction very good.
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was a fun action packed movie!
"Sep 7, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Absolutely horrible. The movie had a lot of differences from the original game, which it should have followed. If it did, I feel like it would have been MUCH better. The whole Sully and Nathan interactions are cringe. Tom Holland was NOT the right actor for this role, absolutely not. Nathan Fillion would have been better, he literally looks just like Nathan Drake. Everything about this movie was bad. Not a single thing I liked, as a fan of Uncharted I was extremely disappointed."
"Sep 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Feels a bit like you're watching Indiana Jones. Entertaining and fun. Recommend for a sunday night movie.
"Sep 7, 2022",POSITIVE,Great adaption of the game! Great acting and fun to watch!
"Sep 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,Lazy and generic to the point you'll forget about it by next Tuesday
"Sep 6, 2022",NEGATIVE,Some parts were extremely cool and the rest was just meh.
"Sep 5, 2022",NEGATIVE,"If you have not seen this movie though have seen Spider Man: No way Home. Wait a few years. I made the mistake of seeing this film right of the heels of seeing No Way Home, the Holland/Wahlberg duo will take some getting used to.
Zendaya Was missed. This Movie was good as far as popcorn movies go, it suffers mainly from the actors overexpose as another character. I like Holland as an actor, however he is dangerously close to being typed cast.

ee"
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Uncharted is a successful popcorn movie. Even though I don't like Indiana Jones movies, the shooting and action scenes were good, and I had fun. I didn't expect more."
"Sep 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Good cast and acting, but storyline is predictable and unoriginal"
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Generic but still very good
"Sep 5, 2022",POSITIVE,Entretenida y divertida
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,A ripoff from other movies. If these pirates were so clever to devise a system of clues to find the treasure why did they not sail to India or china and spend away their wealth. Duh!
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Uncharted (2022): Serviceable adventure movie. A series of set pieces to solve puzzles and fight bad guys in search of lost treasure. Dialog uses wisecracks to indicate no one should take this too seriously. If there's any doubt, the climactic scene is completely over the top. C+"
"Sep 4, 2022",NEGATIVE,What a disappointment! Barely anything left of the wonderful games story. Disjointed plot. Caracters of different ages that are not even given the chance to develop a relationship. I wish somebody that loved and cared for the games had done this movie. Clearly they were just hoping to make a quick buck on some ready made material.
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,Unlikeable characters keep this from a higher rating.
"Sep 4, 2022",POSITIVE,As a fan of the games since i was younger. I think it was pretty good. When they played the theme from the the game i wanted to replay all the games again.
"Sep 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Another example of paid for reviewers not representing the audience. 

 If I ignore the fact that there was something we're some things that got wrong from the games, I enjoy it.  It's not some masterpiece of a movie but it's not bad. It's a decent enough action flick. Basing a movie off of a game is very difficult because you're talking about trying to condense a game that Somebody spent what, 30 hours or more playing into an hour and a 1/2 or 2 hour movie 3. That's not an easy thing to do and as a result sacrifices have to be made when it comes to the story and that's exactly what this movie is guilty of guilty of. It seems to rush the plot and it shows. Its a movie I will watch again to just turn my brain off and enjoy some action."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Action is the only thing going for this movie, even though it is WAY too unrealistic. Plot Armor 1000% for lead role. Marky Mark needs some roles where he isn't himself. It literally hurt to watch his horrible dialogue. I would've felt ripped off paying to see this crap in theaters."
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,Switch your brain off and its enjoyable
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Its a shame this turned out the way it did. Could have been so much better. I hated the casting and found both Drake and Sullys actors to be poorly cast. Tom Holland and Mark Walberg have some good onscreen chemistry but they don't fit their roles well enough. Sully is too young and Drake is too old.
"Sep 3, 2022",NEGATIVE,Should have never been made you would need a clone of Nathan fillion to play this role or Nathan fillion himself or bear casting because that was terrible and the story needed life to it at least it's not as bad as fantastic four that hurt my eyes
"Sep 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"If you were a fan of the video games then you'd be disappointed 

Although there are a few iconic action scenes and easter eggs, this movie surfs off the success of the games, and does not make a fair and accurate representation of the quadrilogy we know and love

The timeline was messed up, and the characters representation / writing wasn't even close.
For example
In the games, Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) was originally friends with Sully (Mark Wahlberg) however, in this movie it had Sam Drake (Rudy Pankow) friends with Sully.

Overall it was a fun watch and did well at being it's own Uncharted, the acting is great but they could have been written more closer to the characters' personalities, I couldn't imagine this Nathan Drake saying or doing half the things he did in this movie.

I encourage you to watch this movie, although it needs work, it was definitely a blessing in disguise"
"Sep 3, 2022",POSITIVE,"A gripping adventure, very well cast with good actors in a great plot. A pleasure watching it all the way through."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"As a fan of the video games I found characterization rather odd. The two protagonists beliefs practically swapped. Nate is now the pensive hero who is sceptical of the supernatural and other fantasies, Sully is wisecracking and not afraid to get his hands dirty when he needs to and actually believes in the supernatural. In the video games Nathan somewhat blindly believes the supernatural and is very happy getting violent, but Sully is apprehensive and is a grumpy old man who is only in it for the money."
"Sep 2, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Formulaic is the only term for it. Wahlberg certainly phoned in this one. Holland, Ali and Gabrielle certainly tried hard to carry the film. But making up for the script and carrying Wahlberg's character was a bridge too far."
"Sep 2, 2022",POSITIVE,Really good movie!  Wish I'd played the game to catch any potential easter eggs or related content that would have been a nod to fans. Good just the same!
"Sep 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"They tried to input elements of the games, but only if you've played them would you be aware. The voice actor of Drake from the games makes a cameo which is cool to. This could be the new Indiana Jones if done right. This movie though is no Raiders of the Lost Ark. Is a good action/adventure film with a good cast."
"Sep 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not an awful movie, just kinda upper mid budget Netflix fare.  Really disappointing as the source material was a hell of a lot better.  Definition of a pure 3 star movie."
"Aug 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Entertaining movie with a strong cast. You get what you expect from a gaming series turned movie. Some good moments and some slow parts but overall a good movie to catch. I would have liked to see more exploration and action but if you have the time check it out.
"Aug 30, 2022",POSITIVE,"So many people gave it bad reviews, and im not sure if it's people who've never played the video games before, but I thought it was great. It's literally the video game in a movie. All the cheesiness, bad jokes, etc. is exactly how the game is. You see the big bosses come in and challenges that you would have to defeat/complete in the game. Also, even little clues you'd have to pick up/puzzles you'd have to solve. As someone who played all the games, and specifically compares it to that I liked it. I hope they do end up making a sequel. Tom Holland is his more typical innocent self, I would say Nate was more of a playboy, but he still did a really good job."
"Aug 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I wanted to love it, but this is quite possibly the dumbest move I've ever seen. It was fun and lighthearted though so it was still relatively entertaining."
"Aug 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,I don't know how this movie got such a high score. My wife gave it a 3 and for me it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Total garbage. 
"Aug 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Just don't bother. If you have seen one treasure hunt movie, you've seen them all."
"Aug 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"Fantastic popcorn flick. Good fun for fans of the Uncharted game series. Hopefully, they get to make more, as just like the games, there's plenty of room for more adventures."
"Aug 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Fun, Entertaining, well made, and completely ridiculous. "
"Aug 28, 2022",POSITIVE,"I enjoyed this, I appreciate when a movie is not filled with trash, compare this to  Me Time which is disgusting trash, I could not watch more than 20 minutes.  Look at the ratings the more family friendly films always do better than the trash."
"Aug 28, 2022",NEGATIVE,Me dormí viendola en el cine. Incoherente.
"Aug 26, 2022",POSITIVE,Just a all around good movie
"Aug 26, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Funny, quick, good action. Wahlberg pretty much comes back as the round 2 of his role from the Italian Job. Even with moments where they push the boundaries of reality just a smidge, forgiveness comes from fun banter and Tom Holland trying not to be spiderman. All in all, it's a fun movie to watch."
"Aug 25, 2022",NEGATIVE,"The humor is bad, the pacing is bad, and Tom Holland was not the right casting choice."
"Aug 24, 2022",NEGATIVE,"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  It took me six days because I kept getting bored and walking away.  I cared so little for any of the characters that I couldn't tell you any of their names!

Then, at the end, they throw in a teaser that his brother is still alive to set the stage for a sequel.  Seriously?  Who is going to want to trust a sequel after this mess???"
"Aug 24, 2022",NEUTRAL,The action scenes in this movie were alright at best. Tom Holland made this movie a fun watch but Mark Wahlberg was very underwhelming as Sully.
"Aug 24, 2022",POSITIVE,Probably one of the best movies based off a video game. Great movie really enjoyed it along with the rest of the family..
"Aug 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Movie was okay. Kinda cheesy. Probably wouldn't have watched it all had it not been for the two leading mean being so attractive, hehe.  But it was still okay. Good visuals."
"Aug 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I thought Mark Walberg and Tom Holland worked really well together; I would like to see them both in more movies. The special effects were okay, but unbelievable at times. It was okay but not as good as national treasure."
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,sooo I think we  MUST clap for tom on this movie  luv the plane part also I want to be cast as drake in uncharted 4 plz anyways you will luv this movie
"Aug 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,Disney vibes. Watchable…
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Date night with hubby. Total success. Loved this movie and hope there is another one one the way. So good. Even our kids watched it the next day and loved it too. #amazing
"Aug 23, 2022",POSITIVE,Solid action movie with a great cast. Very entertaining
"Aug 23, 2022",NEGATIVE,I thought the game was better and my mind did drift a little I just thought it was like a attempt to rekindle Indiana Jones type deal
"Aug 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I love Tom Holland. This movie had great potential.  It just fell flat for me for some reason.  Glad I watched it, but won't go out of my way to watch it again.  My son, who is 11, loved it though."
"Aug 22, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's an OK movie with decent action , acting But where it really falls apart is story"
"Aug 22, 2022",POSITIVE,Really nice adventure movie to chill and watch with the family or friends
"Aug 22, 2022",NEGATIVE,Tentei ver esse filme umas três vezes e não consegui terminar.
"Aug 21, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Not a good film. Lacks a lot of thrills and it could have been a much better adventure movie. The chemistry between the two leads was there, but it wasn't enough. Disappointing, average at best."
"Aug 21, 2022",POSITIVE,"Turn off your brain, get some pop corn, and sit with the kids to watch a treasure hunt.
That pretty much sums up this first installment which one would hope there will be more. It isn't a new concept, or anything original, but that's ok. It has some new plot twists to keep you happy, and it is just a fun movie. Tom, and Mark are great, and for an evening out with the family, this is the perfect thing."
"Aug 21, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I watched it twice, and it was definitely better the first time. So I recommend watching it once and enjoying the heck out of it. Loved it. Watching it the 2nd time a couple months later, it didn’t pack the same humorous punch it did first time. Still think it’s a pretty good movie, but you only need to watch it once. "
"Aug 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"As a big fan of the Uncharted games, I was a little hesitant to watch this movie. No, Tom Holland doesn't seem like Nathan Drake and no, Mark Wahlberg isn't much like Sully, but this film still has some fun action sequences and entertaining banter. It's a generic adventure movie with plenty of plot holes. Honestly, I'd rather play the games, but I didn't mind watching Uncharted."
"Aug 20, 2022",POSITIVE,"Good enjoyable adventure film, Indiana Jones vibes."
"Aug 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Predictable, poorly acted, not a thread of believability. Give me Indiana Jones any day."
"Aug 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,Meh. Just ok. It entertained me but I won't be watching it again.
"Aug 20, 2022",NEGATIVE,Worst videogame movie ever!
"Aug 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The only reason I gave this movie a 3 was because of the senseless destruction of ""priceless artifacts!""  I know criminals do dumb things but, to chase a billion dollar ship with another billion dollar ship until they're both destroyed... I didn't play the games so, I thought it was just super unrealistic."
"Aug 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Rather dull movie that barely passed the time.  My daughter summed it up best, it had the plot of every other treasure hunt movie we've seen lately."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"We thought it was great.  Funny, and the action kept going. Enjoyable"
"Aug 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,ok movie.  Fair.  should have stuck to the game.
"Aug 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The Contractor is gruesomely realistic. It is a film that doesn't have over the top characters, the type of which we have become so accustomed to in action films. All of the characters feel like they could be real people and they all suffer from real world problems. The action scenes are surprisingly fewer than one would expect in a film such as this, but still sweet when they do occur; It is the buildup and the mystery of the plot that takes up most of the screentime, which I actually find preferable. This film sends a disturbing message of how there can often be hidden, corrupt intentions behind the orders some are burdened with carrying out; Not everything is as it seems. I rate this film 7.7 out of 10."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,great movie Wahlberg and Holland make a good team
"Aug 19, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Nothing of the movie reminded me of the game. Specially the characters and the story. The casting was awful, and the jokes very cringy.. You are supposed to watch a movie that reassembles its roots and to feel nostalgic and stuff. Not to change it this bad.. gave it another half star because I watched it with my Gf. And it was nice."
"Aug 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I had low expectations but I actually had fun.

Won't mind checking out the sequel."
"Aug 19, 2022",POSITIVE,"Entertaining, lots of action, adventure and stunts! Kids enjoyed it too."
"Aug 18, 2022",POSITIVE,"This was a very fun adventure-comedy. The chemistry between all characters is great. It is one of the best movies based on a video game franchise. I see that some ""critics"" are calling it unoriginal... it only shows that they didn't bother to look into the source material. I hope they make a sequel."
"Aug 18, 2022",POSITIVE,Always good to see a video game movie that's actually good.
"Aug 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,Couldn't bare to finish the movie. still don't know how it ends
"Aug 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,"wasn't bad. plot was a little boring at times, but action seens were pretty good. could've used some more charachter building. decent watch"
"Aug 18, 2022",NEUTRAL,While not a perfect encapsulation of the video game source material it captured enough of it and proved Tom Holland is a solid lead in pretty much anything. He was able to bring just enough of Nathan Drake from consoles to the big screen. The big set pieces were excellent like the most recent Tomb Raider movie. I hope the studio decides to give Drake a 2nd outing unlike what they decided with Tomb Raider.
"Aug 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wow, sort of like Goonies (the ending) and National Treasure, but this one sucked.  Not sure why Netflix is making these low-budget, unbelievable, bad storyline movies. And really not sure why Mark W. is doing this. I hope he does not just need the money.  Oh, and you cannot jump up as you are falling down and the plan is accelerating.  So bad!"
"Aug 18, 2022",NEGATIVE,"A terrible parody of National Treasurer and Indiana Jones.
Obnoxiously far fetched."
"Aug 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,Check your brains at the door and go have some fun..
"Aug 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"As a huge fan of the video game franchise I had to park my problems with the casting. Tom Holland is decent enough, though my head-canon has always had Nathan Fillion as Nate. Marky Mark is not Sully, however.

But, if you suspend any preconceptions about the franchise and take this as a standalone film and judge it objectively, it's a decent action/adventure flick. Sure, it suffers with being a tad formulaic and it'll rarely surprise you, but it's very watchable and even enjoyable at times. The worst thing is that it's related to a video game franchise that it comes nowhere near matching in terms of quality or cohesive narrative. Oddly, people who haven't played the games will enjoy this a lot more than those that did. It's decent enough though."
"Aug 17, 2022",NEGATIVE,Felt like I was watching a cartoon.  Characterization and plot are thin. CGI action is cartoony and unbelievable.
"Aug 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,Thought this was a fun movie. Not the best but was a great time the whole time.
"Aug 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I was entertained. I liked the characters and their chemistry together. The CGI was a bit much at the end, but the action was overall enjoyable."
"Aug 17, 2022",POSITIVE,"As someone who has played all 4 games and who occasionally whistle the main theme of the franchise while kayaking or hiking, I must say, the movie was very enjoyable. I expected it to be a fun, goofy, adventurous tale with charismatic and endearing characters just like the games and the movie did just that. The actors were great and played off of each other naturally just like Nathan and his companions in the games, with endlessly charming quick, witty, one liners. The plot is pretty goofy and not at all believable, but, hey, neither were the games. However, the set pieces and the action parts were truly spectacular with jumps, parcours and climbing sequences all over the place. The intrigue layered with half-accurate historical facts were just like those of the games ; In other words, a suitable excuse of a backdrop for the whole scavenger hunt. All in all, it was a joy ride as someone who cherished the franchise for its memorable and heartwarming characters as well as it goofy, over the top plot filled with impressive but over the top action. For those who didn't play the games, the movie is just as enjoyable, just like any action movie with great actors and an incredible main theme. Ah, that epic yet rich orchestra still is trapped in my mind :D"
"Aug 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not amazing, not bad. Good watch for a lazy Sunday eve"
"Aug 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,Looks like this had nothing to do with the video games.  Should've gave it another title.  I fell asleep 4 times through the movie.
"Aug 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It had it's moments and I enjoyed the movie, but also a bit been there done that."
"Aug 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,Months later after the theatrical release... Still not a fan. I mean the actors showed up as you would expect but nothing else kept my attention nor was the story worth investing into emotionally
"Aug 16, 2022",NEGATIVE,The first 5 minutes of CGI really set the standard for the rest of the movie.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Super unrealistic, but a fun and funny movie to watch."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Super fan of the video game, this movie delivered on every point. 10/10"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome movie to watch
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Okay so lemme start by saying this was a movie I really never wanted to end I've never played the game but this movie was outstanding I highly recommend it its action packed and loads of fun I highly recommend it to almost anyone
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,it was a Greta movie! Tom Holland did a phenomenal job!!
"Feb 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"Wow, total rip-off of “American Treasure”.  It’s so sad that no one has any imagination or inspiration to make anything other than something that’s already been done.  At least the cinematography was mildly entertaining.  Can’t wait for the sequel… NOT!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,it was amazing loved it so much
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I really like this movie. It had lots of action and I like Mark Wahlberg movies. It kept you wondering who was going to turn against who.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great movie! Very interesting, had some cursing but I just tuned it out."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Refreshing Adventure movie filled with good dialogue and writing overall.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,fun...entertaining....can't wait for part 2...ooops...😆
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very entertaining and exciting!!
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,First half of the movie is great but it loses momentum (and reality) in the latter part. Needless setup for a sequel at the very end too. Acting was good. Overall I would recommend it but not enthusiastically.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It was a cute, cheesy action adventure film."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"This is some much needed escapism from an overall good cast. Whilst some of the source material is oddly reinterpreted (for no apparent reason or improvement to the plot), and some are miscast (the actress playing Chloe Fraser is a poor actress, but a poor fit, with no chemistry with Tom Holland), it is a fun “romp”. Treasure, wild stunts, and a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour, make for a fun viewing experience."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very good. Questionable plot holes, but what’s new in action movies?"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Tom Holland is hot and I loved when he was working out and sitting shirtless on the couch. I only went for the plot which was Tom Holland himself 
The storyline was okay too"
"Feb 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Just avg nothing special
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,awesome love the action and its very entertaining.  Highly recommended
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Nice movie. Light entertainment butbfun.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,soooooooooo GREAT!!!!!! Would pay to see it again!!
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It was fun and entertaining but some of the stunts, scenes, and storyline were so far fetched that it was hard to suspend reality enough and not be sitting there thinking how completely impossible they were."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,It was action packed and kept me interested
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"The movie was a lot of fun! 

They took elements from the game and kept the spirit of it even with the changes. Chloe, Nate and Sully were perfectly cast, and there were great performances from the villains in the movie too, showing the ruthlessness that villains have in the game series.

If you like fun, adventure and a few laughs, Uncharted is well worth a watch."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very fun, light, action packed movie similar in vein to National Treasure and some aspects of Da Vinci Code.  Get your popcorn ready!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining from start to finish with a hint of a follow up to come!
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Good popcorn muncher and enjoy the movie. If you like National  Treasure with action this is for you..
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"So the movie was underwhelming for me. I knew it wasn’t gonna be that great when I seen Mark Wahlberg was gonna be Sully. Tom Holland just felt too young to be Nathan Drake and his young sounding voice didn’t help. I seen it with my parents and they liked the movie, probably because they never played the games so they had nothing to compare it to. That being said, that’s exactly what it felt like. It felt like the movie was made by a director who had never played the games and actors that never played the games. Hopefully it does well though cause I would like to see the whole series made into movies."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I loved this movie!  It was entertaining and funny!!  Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg were amazing!
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great action movie! It’s funny, adventurous and full of plot twists. Go see it!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I played all the games. although the story is not exactly the same, the film itself is absolutely amazing. Tom Holland and Mark Walburg do an outstanding job of bringing us action, adventure, and comedy all inside one film. it's a must see!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,The bass in the room. Cleanliness...and the seats
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I was really pleasantly surprised with the dynamic between Mark and Tom. Huge fan of the games and the movie lived up to expectations set by Naughty dog in the games
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Muy divertida y entretenida, excelente pelcula"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Very well put together. I’ve never played the game that it’s based on but I still found the story easy to follow
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Mark made the movie better :)
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,I give it 4 stars . Some parts were slow and kind of dragged out but it was all in all a very good movie.
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,the end disappoint me
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"A fleet-footed and fun adventure film with bountiful humor and cool set pieces. Tom Holland makes an excellent Nathan Drake, and those unfamiliar with the games will still delight in the thrills, spills, and flying pirate ships. Yarr."
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Decent movie, one that won't loose anything watching at home."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Great Adventure title, especially if you enjoy Indiana Jones and the like. awesome story with an incredible cast"
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"If you liked Indiana Jones and National Treasure, you'll love Uncharted!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Lots of humor and  excitement.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Fun movie to watch and good humor
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"There was action, comedy and nonstop excitement"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"A cross between the Goonies and Jack Sparrow. A refreshing approach for my son who is 11. Can't  wait for the sequel. Tom Holland was amazing. And it was nice to see Mark Whalburg take a less "" tough"" roll."
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Fun movie. Very well acted but the story could use some more imagination.  Felt like I had seen many of the scenes from other adventure movies in the past.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Such a good movie. Tom is such a good actor. The story was good. It kept you interested from beginning to the very end. Can’t wait for the next one
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Awesome movie very funny and suspenseful. I recommend must watch movie I loved it
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Critics are always stupid, don't listen to them. This movie was surprisingly good, way better than what I was expecting for a video game movie adaptation. Tom Holland definitely looks too young to be an action hero, but the movie still holds up if you can get past that. If you're a fan of action movies, even if you're not into the Uncharted games, it's definitely one I'd recommend (though it's fairly tame with violence compared to some others). Also the Nolan North cameo was 10/10"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great adventure and action movie. The whole family liked it.
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,What you think it would be
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Entertaining action movie
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"It's a very good movie. Changes were made from the source material, but nothing to take away the fun. It serves the purpose of entertaining the audience. I will watch the sequel, if it happens!! Good fun!!!"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,My kids absolutely loved it and so did I!
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Excellent   Highly recommend
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Fun and exciting, action from beginning to end. Finally a good movie that didnt need to have sex and profanity in it"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Great cast! Some plot twists made it more enjoyable since several scenes seemed predictable. Would love to see a Part 2 created since the ending left the audience wondering if Nate would ever be reunited with his brother.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,My daughter and I went for a movie night date and the movie was so good she’s hopes there’s a part 2.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Tom Holland never disappoints!! Great action packed movie!!!
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"I loved this movie!  It was exciting, fun, and funny from start to finish.  Can't recommend it highly enough.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Seriously an absolute must see!  I will recommend it to everyone I know."
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,It was a cross between national treasure and goonies
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Better than expected.
"Feb 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,Woof.  My kids said they liked it...  but even that was with weak emphasis. Would def wait for streaming. Cliche. Plot was a joke. Action sequences were mediocre. Score was forgettable. Camera work was boring. Sound was decent. Concept was a bomb.  Just rewatch Tomb Raider or etc.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Very action packed and kept you entertained, some of the humor was a little ehh but overall a good movie."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Entertaining from the beginning to the end.  Some of the Dialogue was a little cheesy, but was enjoyable"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Was a lot of fun! Felt true to the games while making an original story. Think a sequel will have a lot of elements from the first game. Overall, I loved it. Even Wahlberg won me over as Sully. Must see!"
"Feb 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,Predictable. Reasonably enjoyable.
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Nice little PG action flick,  good for 11-13 y.o."

"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"good movie, love tom"
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,Amazing from start to finish
"Feb 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,"It's mindless riffraff like this that I try to avoid at all costs, unfortunately I let my guard down and paid the steep price of boredom for close to 200 minutes."
"Feb 27, 2022",POSITIVE,"Lots of twist and turns in the movie. A little far fetched toward the end, but still a good movie. Im waiting for part two."

"Feb 27, 2022",NEGATIVE,decent fun Disney type movie... more for kids
