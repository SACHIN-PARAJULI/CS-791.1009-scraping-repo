"Apr 3, 2024",NEUTRAL,Fantastic movie. I still love it as an adult and my 7 year old son can't get enough.
"Feb 27, 2024",NEUTRAL,"The movie is constantly turning fantasy conventions on their head (the ""chosen one"" is a baby girl, but the ""chosen one"" is basically a McGuffin, the title character/central hero of the story would typically be a sidekick, Kilmer would typically be the hero but he's the sidekick, etc.) While its visuals have held up remarkably well."
"Feb 23, 2024",NEUTRAL,Great movie!!! One of my favorites growing up
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Mediocre Lord of the Rings ripoff.  Ron Howard had a decent career, but this was no example...(you should wait another year to see Parenthood to see him at his best; which is pretty good.  Not this...)"
"Feb 21, 2024",NEUTRAL,This movie was part of my childhood. I still love it till this day üëç
"Feb 19, 2024",NEUTRAL,"Not perfect, but an 80s classic. And so, soooooo much better than the show, in so many ways"
"Jan 4, 2024",NEUTRAL,A charming fantasy classic
"Dec 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,One of the classic childhood fairytale memories. First Val Kilmer movie I saw.
"Dec 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's Solid. I can see why someone would be really nostalgic for this if they grew up with it but also it's well done to boot. Warwick is the best thing and is likeable and charming. Everyone else does a solid job also. Kilmer can be a little weird and out of place every now and than but he eventually comes around and settles down and the two little guys can be a bit annoying also as the comedic relief. The villian isn't bad but I wish there was more focus and interaction between her and our heroes throughout besides the end. The music and cinematography are really good and are the highlight. There is amazing sweeping shots and really good effects throughout of all varieties. Sometimes it can be a little shotty but overally they are really clean. The editing and pacing are solid too. This can start a bit slow but once the action starts it's thrilling and a lot of fun. The main issue that holds this back from standing with contemporaries like The Princess Bride is it is VERY cheesy, senimental, and campy at times in the acting and over the top moments. Which are fun still. On paper this should'nt work as well as it does, but the overloading of charm and passion shines through. You can feel the love in making this and its chessiness is what gives it it's own identity. Also, I do wish there was perhaps a bit more characters besides Kilmer and Warwick to flesh out the adventure a bit more. If I was a kid watching this I'd probably love this a lot more which this is clearly aimed at. As it stands anyone who loves adventures, fantasies, any actors in this, the director, or grew up with this should check this out."
"Nov 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun to see George Lucas' style on another movie! Yes the storyline is ‚Äògeneric' and doesn't say much below the surface level, but it's a solid story that is easy to watch. The winning aspect of this movie is the loveable characters, they draw you in and are easy to root for."
"Sep 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Some magical beings show up at times with no explanation, but that doesn't stop this from being a really fun movie. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer are hilarious together."
"Aug 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Slowish and taking itself a little too seriously, like most fantasy of its period, but entertaining."
"Aug 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Willow more like Willno, it's alright I guess"
"Jul 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It was a bit scary. 

The angel was spectacular. 

It was a bit long but it's a really good story."
"Jul 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ron Howard's finest Work in my opinion. A PERFECT Fantasy Adventure. I love how Willow's friend Migosh stayed with Willow, when everyone else from his Village would not. A good lesson in Loyalty and courage, seen it several times and I'll see it MANY more!"
"Jul 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Willow had a budget of 35 million dollars and since its release, it has made a portion of that back."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"4.5 is probably more than this movie strictly deserves, but I'm a sucker for the fantasy genre and Val Kilmer was so infectiously likable that I had to give it another .5 stars."
"Jul 4, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A pretty fun movie, takes me back to my younger days. Decent storyline, and good acting from some notable stars but surprising newcomers as well. Definitely recommend this for an easy, and entertaining nights viewing."
"Jun 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,A Masterpiece. A great movie who need study in Cinema 's school.
"May 25, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is an amazing classic I overlooked for far too long
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun fantasy fluff. The characters aren't deep, and the plot isn't complicated, but it has nice sets/costumes/effects for its time...and is just fun! If you want a fantasy that doesn't get ""too dark"" or Too nerdy"" this is just right."
"May 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,THIS MOVIE FREAKED ME OUT AS A KID AND YET I STILL LOVE IT.
"May 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Willow wasn't one of Ron Howard's biggest critical darlings but it did grow enough of a fan base in the last 35 years as far as fantasy-adventure pictures are concerned This was a big deal for vertically challenged actors and allowed Warwick Davis to get his first starring role ever since he started out in Star Wars Taking place in a magical land run by evil Queen Bavmorda she tries to kill a young baby destined to overthrow her The baby's mother dies and the mid wife smuggles the child out to safety but is lost in the river The child ends up in the hands of a small man named Willow Willow lives in his dwarf village with a family and many others He's an aspiring magician hoping to master his skills and he finds out the secret of the baby and her importance Willow is then set on a quest to deliver the child to a powerful enchantress and hopefully defeat the queen with the help of a wand The queen's daughter Sorsha is tasked to hunt the child down, while Willow runs into a disaffected warrior named Madmartigan Willow still has to master his skills so he's not the best at it, he even accidentally casts a love spell over Madmartigan which of course causes a hilarious rift between him and Sorsha The film is steeped deep in fantasy with witches, fairies and dragons The pacing is pretty lackluster in this as it doesn't follow its own urgency At best the plot is generic as it's been done better But it's nice to watch Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer bounce off each other The effects aren't spectacular but fit with a fantasy film of this caliber There's nice character designs and it'll provide escapism for kids seeking a sword-and-sorcery diversion 'Willow' and its sequel tv series has a charming hokey ness to it all and make high fantasy goofy"
"Apr 29, 2023",NEUTRAL,A wonderful adventure with heart. It was great sharing this with my own children.
"Apr 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"This is one of those movies  which pulls off the Gilbert and Sullivan trick of subverting the form whilst reinforcing it. 

Yes the overall story is quote unquote ""Generic"",  but its the performances that really bring this story to life.  Val Kilmer brings the lovable rogue Madmartigan to life, whilst Warrick Davies (with hair !!) plays the eponymous hero with great enthusiasm and energy that was lacking in the reboot. 

In a 'generic' retelling it would have been Madmartigan who was the main character rather than the sidekick,  but subverting the form by having that role go to someone who would normally serve as the Hero's conscience (in effect Davies plays both roles) brilliantly subverts the form and reinforces it at the time. 

It plays well to Tolkien's view that it is the small things that enable us to resist great evil. Yes the CGI is laughable by 21st Century standards but it works well with the a great cast who really brought the story to laugh."
"Apr 19, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fun movie. A not too serious fantasy from 1988, so don't expect it to be anything near as good as a movie from 10-20 years later. However it's still enjoyable and funny. 

Modern critics on this site panned it for stealing from Harry Potter, apparently they don't know that this came out before Harry Potter was published. I'm not sure how one can be a professional critic without even knowing the dates that major influential works were published, it voids any review they give on an older work. 

It would be like accusing Dune of stealing from Star Wars or Lord of the Rings of stealing from Harry Potter, you just sound incredibly uninformed when you do that."
"Apr 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great movie, probably not good reviews because too many morons that only like super cheezy and generic movies rate things here.  I guess I have to start reviewing or be at the mercy of idiots."
"Mar 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,Still amazing after all these years.
"Mar 20, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Fantasy story , lovely heart warming and good plot."
"Mar 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,classic and better than the remake XD
"Mar 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,An underrated classic that is a must see. Made back when movies were great! It's a shame that modern films aren't more like this.
"Mar 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,Best fantasy movie before Lord of The Rings.
"Mar 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Willow no est√° mal, es una pel√≠cula bastante entretenida, aunque siendo un film de fantas√≠a, hubiera quedado m√°s atractiva con m√°s efectos especiales, aunque los que se ven aqu√≠ son aceptables. La historia est√° buena, la banda sonora tambi√©n y el elenco. Val Kilmer es lo mejor de la cinta con su personaje bien descarado y divertido a la vez. El protagonista Willow es algo torpe, lo cual hace dif√≠cil que √©l tenga que ser el h√©roe de la historia, pero es un personaje entra√±able y merec√≠a ser aprovechado al m√°ximo. No puedo decir que Willow es una de las mejores pel√≠culas de fantas√≠a que existen, pero es un cl√°sico de culto interesante para los amantes de la fantas√≠a. Mi calificaci√≥n final para esta cinta es un 8/10."
"Feb 26, 2023",NEUTRAL,Mediocre Tolkien knockoff.  A good cast makes up for the weak writing.
"Feb 24, 2023",NEUTRAL,Great movie. I just watched it with my eight year old and told him how I watched it when I was eight years old. We both loved it. Sad that they made such a horrible sequel last year but the original was just brilliant.
"Feb 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,"So I watch this film for the first time, and it is corny as can be. I thought it was just a corny, lovable film, it has a lot of depth and a lot of entertaining moment. But it has a lot of corniness and cheesy aspects of the film. It's a film that I would watch ones which I did, and I probably would never watch again. It's not a bad movie. It's just not enjoyable all the way through."
"Feb 9, 2023",NEUTRAL,She desperately disappointing‚Ä¶ gave up after 2nd episode‚Ä¶
"Feb 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A great classic which I've seen many times.  But it's not perfect.  As the two Brownies can be very annoying.  Plus some of the effects are good but not perfect, lastly some shit humor.  Which I can always do without.  But like I said, it is a classic and worth checking out."
"Feb 2, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Ah, 80's fantasy movies, how one can not love them? But let us not be blinded by our nostalgia for that kind of movies (which is currently strongly on the rise), let us see ""Willow"" for what it is. I've seen it recently for the first time, so I have no nostalgia for it and can judge it without that nostalgia. And what I see without it is a movie that is quite strange. And by that I don't mean Jim Henson strange, like in ""otherworldly"", but that it is all over the place ‚Äì inconsistent in themes, in pacing, in character design... Sometimes it is hard to grasp what was the intention of a given scene, even when you know what precedes it and what comes after it. It seems like this movie was directed by three different persons, it really does. But it is not devoid of charm and the production design is also at least acceptable. It didn't bore me, so that's a plus. But there are far better 80's fantasy movies than this one. Shame I've already seen them all..."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Great Fantasy. Greater than the Tv Show for sure. The Tv Show really disappoints on numerous amount of times and levels. This was straight fun, fantastical,  magical, and actually made with love and care. The Tv Show was made for the bants."
"Feb 1, 2023",NEUTRAL,This is just another example of why the film industry and the audience are completely on opposite sides of what a good film actually is. With a smash of 52% from critics and like 90% from audiences. This film is amazing! Subtle and exciting! The kind of movie people get married to each other after it's over! There was something about George Lucas in the 80's. He made movies like you were reading the book. Directors try to hard or focus too much on unimportant things and forget about the plot and characters. Stick to the feel and story stop making things to surprise us. People want purpose and good writing like Willow the first one not the other one.
"Jan 31, 2023",NEUTRAL,The writing and music will absolutely date this. Rule of thumb is never put modern music in a show that supposed to be set in a fantasy setting. Definitely feels more like you're watching an older sci fi fantasy like hercules or xena than an epic adventure.
"Jan 30, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I grew up watching this movie and I still love it as an adult. It's a wonderful blend of humor, action, and adventure, with plenty of heart, imagination, and an amazing musical score. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer are both great in their roles, and the special effects are still impressive to this day.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time!"
"Jan 27, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I love ""Willow"", personally. While it's not my absolute all-time favorite film, it certainly ranks up there."
"Jan 23, 2023",NEUTRAL,Terrible. Turned it off within the first 20 mins.
"Jan 22, 2023",NEUTRAL,Love some good queer fantasy rep
"Jan 21, 2023",NEUTRAL,"A fun movie that still has that 80's charm because of good acting. directing and script. It's telling the flip in ratings this has with the current show in both audience (much higher than the show) and critics scores.  If you want to know if something is good, look at the audience score and ignore ""professional"" critics."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Watched it for the second time, since i forgot what it was about, and enjoyed it sososososo much! It's so funny and quirky and just not your typical fantasy movie. I can't see all those LotR copies anymore! Really suggest everyone to watch it"
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,"a childhood favorite, full of warm feelings, excitement, laughter and great characters."
"Jan 18, 2023",NEUTRAL,Gran pel√≠cula que envejece muy bien con El Paso del tiempo.
"Jan 17, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nice fresh fantasy show, it's modernity is visible but it really enhances the all show without being out of place. The relationship between Kit and Jade feels real and in line with the story. The finale had a nice twist and I hope for more seasons."
"Jan 16, 2023",NEUTRAL,A redone classic. I love it the more I saw. The character all had a good back story that kept me excited. I wanted the hero's to do good and didn't want to see any die off. I loved the whole journey through the season. I really like the wardrobe and weaponry. I thought it was hilarious at moments and magical when needed. I loved the original movie I probably watched it every day as a kid and I'm very excited to see more of my childhood favorite and I think with this newer aged take my kids will now enjoy it as well. I'm very excited to see my favorite actor Warwick Davis be a yet another fantasy genre movie. I always say you can't make a good fantasy movie with him in it.
"Jan 15, 2023",NEUTRAL,Lost for words at this it's just poor poor poor disney sure is going down the toilet.
"Jan 14, 2023",NEUTRAL,"I loved the series, I think the visibility that a platform as big as Disney invests in a lesbian protagonist is very important for the concept of a new world, an innate respect for what is said about love"
"Jan 13, 2023",NEUTRAL,"The first two or three episodes were a bit... meh, but from episode four I was absolutely hooked.  I'd go so far as to say it's the best fantasy I've seen in a long, long time. 
Totally recommended.  Really looking forward to a season 2!"
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,fantastic fantasy made my childhood
"Jan 12, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Cute, funny, and unique show with amazing actors, plot, and visuals."
"Jan 11, 2023",NEUTRAL,"One of the best series I have ever seen. All the characters are really deep and I love how they became a perfect group after being a total mess at the beginning. The film team did an awesome job and I hope they know that the bad ratings are just unjustified... 
If you have not watched it yet give it a try and I promise you, you won't regret it!"
"Jan 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"loved this series, so differant to what was around at the time"
"Jan 10, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Love this! Such a well done series! The actors are all awesome, the cinematography incredible. Disney PLEASE renew for another season. My high schoolers only happened upon it, and it's just now becoming popular at their school. We all need another season!"
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Overall, the decade-old picture Legend from the fantasy genre is equally as influential as Willow is now. It laid the way for subsequent fantasy epics and is a more than respectable movie on its own. It's definitely worth a look for any genre enthusiasts."
"Jan 8, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Nice looking special effects but a boring script with some good actors but man the pacing is pretty bad. Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis are the best but everybody else is mediocre. 
Nov 29 22"
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Willow is a good example of why you shouldn't listen to movie ""Critics""."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"Now I don't think Willow is the best fantasy film ever made(a three way-toss up between Pan's Labyrinth, Edward Scissorhands and The NeverEnding Story) nor is it the worst(Dungeons & Dragons). It does have problems, but I thought it was entertaining.

My first problem is Warwick Davis, now his title character is a very charming and likable character, but Davis's performance is somewhat uneven. At first it is uncomfortable and bland, then as the film progressed he got better as we got to know the character better. Another problem is that the special effects are a little dated especially the beast with the two heads. My final flaw is that there are one or two scenes in the middle half that felt a little forced.

However, thanks to a quirky, funny and honest script, it is actually entertaining. You may argue that the film is too long, and that the plot is unoriginal and formulaic, but the film does move quickly and a lot happens. The scenery, cinematography and costumes are also really nice to look at, maybe not as stunning as other fantasy films such as the Lord of the Rings movies, NeverEnding Story or Legend(which has one of the most exquisitely rendered forest sets I have ever seen on it) but it at least looks nice. The score by James Horner is also really pleasant though Horner has done better(I still bawl at the main theme for The Land Before Time), the main theme is definitely memorable and is surprisingly not generic. The direction from Ron Howard is good, and the acting is decent as they bring alive somewhat interesting characters. Davis is uneven as I have said already, but Joanne Whalley is alluring as Sorscha, while Val Kilmer does really well in a flashier and darker role with some good lines. Rool and Franjean are the funniest characters, and it is a delight to see Billy Barty again. However, Jean Marsh steals the show as Queen Bavmorda, her performance is the epitome of sheer evil.

Overall, flawed but decent fantasy film with some interesting elements. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's sort of cute. But, some of the dialogue is pretty cringe-worthy."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,"It's beautiful, it's funny, the characters are charismatic, it's entertaining. The magic, the world, the story, Kit and Jade's relationship and its representation that it's unique in itself, everything about this show is perfect."
"Jan 7, 2023",NEUTRAL,Dumb and childish even for kids.
"Jan 6, 2023",NEUTRAL,An excellent film from start to finish! Definite must see.
"Jan 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,Painful Lucas LOTR knockoff. Threw in the towel after 45 minutes because why would I do this to myself for two hours
"Jan 5, 2023",NEUTRAL,What a grand film. :)
"Jan 3, 2023",NEUTRAL,Amazing classic must-see movie.
"Dec 31, 2022",NEUTRAL,Rewatched this to regain the magic after watching 1 episode of the butchered reboot that Disney made. Will pretend the reboot never existed and only remember this classic ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Dec 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie as a child, I love it still today"
"Dec 29, 2022",NEUTRAL,A classic and a must watch for any fans of fantasy.
"Dec 28, 2022",NEUTRAL,A classic fantasy story and a huge dose of dry humor! Any fan of similar classics like Princess Bride will love the Willow movie and recent TV series on Disney+.
"Dec 25, 2022",NEUTRAL,Wonderfull fantasy movie from the 80-s!
"Dec 23, 2022",NEUTRAL,"some of the special effects aged poorly, however the characters, story and action scenes hold up. Loved it as a kid, offspring really enjoyed it, still enjoy it now"
"Dec 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Really liked it when viewing as a youngster. Rewatching it again as an adult in anticipation of the series, it holds up OK, but wasn't quite as good as I remembered it. Still decent for an 80s fantasy movie, but we've had better since then."
"Dec 19, 2022",NEUTRAL,mieux que la s√©rie que Disney a sortie .
"Dec 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's an original story. Despite the time it was released, very well built."
"Dec 14, 2022",NEUTRAL,"We loved this movie when it first came out, the action and especially the love story always had a special place in not only mine but my sisters heart as well. Yes it can be a bit hokey here and there, but overall the movie is a fun little ride. Hopefully, it stands the test of time."
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,This movie is a classic fantasy adventure movie.
"Dec 12, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Unlike the new series that Disney produced, this movie had an action-packed storyline. I really enjoyed Val Kilmer's character."
"Dec 11, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Muy bonita historia me encant√≥ en su tradici√≥n en la tv y a hora en Disney, 10 de 10 hermosa üíñ üíï üòò ‚ô•Ô∏è üòç ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Dec 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"One of my favorite childhood films. Brilliant blend of action, humor and a hero's journey."
"Dec 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,The Movie I saw in Cinemas and enjoyed a couple of Times on VHS / DVD. Still good acting from Val Kilmer.
"Dec 10, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Not sure how to rate this movie but it‚Äôs watchable for the most part. Pretty much the same plot as the LOTR but lamer characters, over the top acting, and decent effects for it‚Äôs time."
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,"√ìtimo filme, com o cl√°ssica jornada do her√≥i, cheio de fantasia, guerreiros, a√ß√£o.."
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,Fantastic and timeless.  Superb in all ways.
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,A true classic and masterpiece
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,A true fantasy classic that is just a fun campy adventure.
"Dec 9, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the best fantasy movies of the 80's.
"Dec 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,This was one of my favourite movies when I was a kid.
"Dec 8, 2022",NEUTRAL,"""Willow"" has its faults (one being that Willow does yell ""Madmartigan!!!"" a lot, lol), but I just couldn't give it a lower score. It was a family favorite when I was a kid, and unlike some things from my child years it still holds up pretty well. For one thing there's that glorious, glorious James Horner score. And also the beautiful scenery- some filmed in New Zealand. Warwick Davis gives an absolutely amazing performance considering he was only 17 or so. And then there's Val Kilmer in one of his many iconic performances. It's just a fun fantasy adventure movie, not too dark or serious."
"Dec 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Well, it‚Äòs clearly not Lord of the Rings quality, however fairly entertaining eg thanks Val Kilmer."
"Dec 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,love it great fun for all ages
"Dec 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I loved this movie as a kid and it was my favorite movie for many years.  A great fantasy movie NOT based on LoTR is an achievement.  As an adult, I think the movie still holds up, largely because the acting, writing and humor in the movie are still good."
"Dec 7, 2022",NEUTRAL,Loved it!!!! Feels like Fantasy at its BEST!
"Dec 6, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Well unlike the series it was NOT used as a vehicle to force a lesbian ""romance"" into our faces. Also Val Kilmer was the man."
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite movies of the 80's.  Too bad the people behind the new series apparently never watched the original film....
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Grande classico! Ainda hoje √© divertido e inteligente. Todos os personagens s√£o incriveis. Efeitos, em algumas horas datados, mas n√£o estraga a experi√™ncia e divers√£o."
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,I loved Willow. It was easily one of my favorite movies as a kid and I still love it as an adult.
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Legendary, very far from Disney's wokes"
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,For a Movie of the 80s this has a well deserved cult following. There is enough story telling to have watchers escape into another world and action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The comic relief from the brownies is on point.  This is an easy movie to watch and can take you on a fun adventure in another world.
"Dec 5, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I re-watched it after years to refresh my memory ahead of the new TV show.
Now, speaking of ""fantasy"", we are used to something far different (Willow 1988 setting and costume are more like a cheap carnival), but I would say the film has aged fairly well."
"Dec 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"The critics got this wildly wrong.  I re-watched this and it is just as 10 year old me remembered, a cracking adventure romp (fewer pigs than I remember)
It's got a non standard romantic twist, adventure and light hearted humour at points.  Good for kids and adults alike."
"Dec 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,I love Willow. A great fantasy ride.
"Dec 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Our family has watched this many times.  Hollywood, this is what Great entertainment looks like."
"Dec 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Good film.
worth a watch.

Keep away from the series."
"Dec 4, 2022",NEUTRAL,"This is NOT GOOD so far to say the Least. The Special Effects, the Storyline & Characters I could care less for them. What's the point of this show? 
Why don't you just call it something else instead of Capitalizing on something from the 80's. Disney again misses the mark on what Fans want, why can't you write/produce something amazing? On a scale from 1-10 I give this a 3/10."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of my guilty pleasures. A totally underrated movie.
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I watched for nostalgia hoping to be captivated by a story plot line. But was left to be desired. The storyline is not cohesive, they introduced us to characters then shifted focus completely. It's undetermined who the main story focuses on."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Classic as it getsüëç‚ùóÔ∏è
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A good movie, perfectly age."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,a Classic now. an hidden gem whose cult grew over the years. This movie did not deserve the Disney+ treatment it is getting. Stick with the movie.
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Terrible. The plot is ridiculous, the characters all speak in modern day terms, and it feels cheesy. I love fantasy stories but this one misses the mark. I might enjoy it more if I were 11, but not as an adult. It's a shame, the concept could have been great."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Cute, adorable fantasy movie.... loved it as a kid, love it as an adult.  The TV series is trash but the movie has withstood the test of time."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Loved it growing up. Great story telling good imagination
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Loved the original.. Current storyline is predictable and wrapped in self service. Fans want fantasy, not soap opera."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Funny how this movie gets a lower score than the new Disney show which is total shi.. 
tomato scores are a joke these days.."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,Can't believe I never seen this before. Just finished watching and it's fantastic!!!
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,"It's good and funny in general, a few character like Kit are a little bit annoying, and has a little problem with the pace. But Warwick is very good in it."
"Dec 3, 2022",NEUTRAL,me encanta . en su epoca fue una alternativa al se√±or de los anillos. pero el toque de Lucas la hizo totalmente fresca e inolvidable. la amo. me emociona cuando la veo.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Even though the story has room for improvement, Willow does have its rather impressive effects during its time and its star performance from Warwick Davis."
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Absolute classic, better than the junk they make these days"
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,This was an amazing movie for it's time. It was from the 80s and I find that's when the best fantasy themed action movies were released. They didn't have all the fancy graphics but they had a great story and fantastic acting!
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the best fantasy films of my childhood.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Great original movie
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,I loved it as child. Somethings don't hold up after so many years but the story is still good. It has humor and still to this day gives you a desire to adventure.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Rings of power was so terrible this looks like a masterpiece. And it is good entertainment.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,A mythical adventure about over coming the odds for the good of the planet. Great movie for those that enjoy an original story with the most unlikely protagonist.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Excelente filme. Hero√≠smo, aventura, fantasia. Um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos."
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Its got some issues but I enjoyed it
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"A fun, wholesome movie. Definitely a gem of it's time."
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,Love it!  Classic Fantasy!  Action adventure start to finish!
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,The 1988 Willow is a classic.  Remember seeing this as a child and really enjoying it.
"Dec 2, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Loved this as a kid, even visited the set in wales, UK. Great old movie,."
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,A classic fantasy with lots of Gen X nostalgia!
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Great movie about a person who is counted out and discarded as someone who can't make a difference and ends up saving the world. Great acting, great story, great wardrobe, great cinematography. Great sets."
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,Lotr does compare as a cult classic.
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,Willow is one of the greatest fantasy movies ever made and I will accept no criticism
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,Great Movie   BOOOOOO Disney
"Dec 1, 2022",NEUTRAL,One of the classics. 
"Nov 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,Modern fancy effects and Warwick Davis' engaging acting can't quite make up for Willow's plodding pace and unoriginal plot.
"Nov 30, 2022",NEUTRAL,"I grew up watching this movie (heavy rotation), a top notch, fun family fantasy film.  If you are looking for platinum tier sword and sorcery flick from the 80s with practical effects, look no further.  Willow sort has this charm that keeps pulling you in, and to top it off it has the greatest swordsman to ever live in it."
"Nov 27, 2022",NEUTRAL,"terrible acting, generic script, this is fifty shades of child abduction"
"Nov 17, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Classic fantasy, charming and fun for the whole family. Much beloved by a generation for a reason. Beautiful sets and costumes, memorable dialog and wonderful characters."
"Nov 16, 2022",NEUTRAL,"Although on a story level it doesn't completely come together on a few occasions, with for the time great special effects and a lead character you root for, it's able to successfully tell a fun, fantasy adventure story making it a fun watch."
"Nov 1, 2022",NEUTRAL, An under-rated magical fantasy just because critics expected more from George Lucas and Ron Howard. I have no idea how much better you could expect. The movie is a magical treat.
"Oct 20, 2022",NEUTRAL,I love it great film i enjoy it
"Sep 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I first watched this movie in the theater with my best friend when I was 11 years old. I've watched this movie over and over and never get sick of it. There are some very funny moments between the characters that made me burst out laughing. I see it more as a comedy in a fantasy world. I'm not analytical about this particular movie, I just know that I had fun watching it, and that's what counts. People liked Conan The Barbarian, which I could see that world spilling over into this fantasy world. It is a family movie, so, there's really no problem letting your kids see it if they like sci-fi fantasies."
"Sep 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I had some fun watching it, but the whole thing was too bleak and surprisingly dull despite all the fantastic creatures and all the magic."
"Sep 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It's pretty dumb and silly, but it's a fun and interesting story."
"Sep 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,Major skills mad mardigan n first time little person kicked ass well before the hobbits.
"Aug 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Despite riveting special effects and a fun Val Kilmer performance, Willow ultimately loses itself in a mess of poor plotting, lame dialogue, and a lot of tonal inconsistency."
"Aug 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,"one of the very best fantasy film, need a sequel !"
"Aug 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,I love this movie.  I grew up with it and it's great.  I don't know what everyone else is thinking with their 50%.
"Jul 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,The special effects for the time were really well done. One of my favorite fantasy movies of all time. a must see for any medieval fantasy fan
"Jul 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,"The film is good. I love the story, but it's not very realistic. The actors are well chosen. :)"
"Jun 30, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Not much sword or sorcery here. The concept of ""hobbits"" has been done to death, no matter what you call them. If you like midgets, then see ""Time Bandits"" -- a much better film in every way."
"Jun 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"An unexpected hero must find the fortitude to protect an innocent child from falling in to the clutches of the evil Queen Bavmorda in the fantasy adventure WILLOW, from 1988. Ron Howard directs based on a story by George Lucas, which centers around the unassured dwarf, Willow, as he selflessly crosses miles of treacherous terrain and faces countless foes with the aid of a few unlikely allies. Despite his small stature, Warwick Davis becomes the embodiment of strength and courage as his journey transforms him into an honest hero. Val Kilmer stars beside him as the loud-mouthed thief, Madmartigan, who is given the chance to betray his instincts and fight for good. He is enjoyable, as well, if not overly eccentric. It is Jean Marsh that steals every scene, however, as Queen Bavmorda, the center of evil and corruption in this otherwise peaceful world. She is more frightening than any of the disfigured monsters that roam her wretched kingdom. The path to Tir Asleen presents many dangers, which are brought to life through the creative costuming by Barbara Lane and Industrial Light and Magic's Oscar-nominated effects. Each of the stunning exteriors transport us to a mystical world where these things can truly exist. WILLOW is undoubtedly a classic in the genre, and one that is filled with fantasy, adventure, and heart.

I Like Horror Movies"
"Jun 14, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Loved it when I was younger so i bought it. 20+ years later and its shows its age now. In true 80's movie fashion char are black n white , instant love, no one but the small or outcast hero can save the day. still a fun movie if watching it for first time with open mind or family probably even Better if your a 7 - 11 year old. Visually it holds up effects wise, so does the pacing of the movie, story is simple save the princess destroy evil queen. All in all. Still worth a look at on netflix."
"Jun 13, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Adventure, Love, Betrayal, and Friendship make this a great movie for the whole family."
"Jun 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"3: It's amazing how much one can forget about films they saw years and years ago.  Much of Willow seemed pretty new to me, which I suppose isn't that surprising as it's possible I haven't seen it in about 25 years.  I may have only seen it once though, so despite the fact I remember enjoying it, it didn't stick with me apart from an illusory concept of a fantastical film in a world not entirely unlike that of LOTR, The Labyrinth, or The Neverending Story.  It is very 80's.  Ridiculously so.  It always blows my mind when people speak of the 80s as a great decade for film.  It is more of a black hole with a few bright spots for me, but I can of course understand and appreciate why many fondly recall what they grew up with.  Interesting film that has held up pretty well over the years even if it will always remain firmly planted in 1988 (i.e. it is does not have the sort of timeless quality that some of the best pictures do)."
"Jun 11, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Elokuvalla kest√§√§ kohtuuttoman kauan l√§hte√§ k√§yntiin, mik√§ on aina huono juttu kahden tunnin elokuvalle. Loppua kohden toimintatykitys kovenee ja kohtaukset muuttuvat kekseli√§√§mmiksi. Ep√§tasainen katselukokemus on loppujen lopuksi palkitseva, mutta mestariteoksena sit√§ ei voi pit√§√§."
"Jun 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"83%
Full of eye popping visual effects, just the right amount of humor action, and just a magnificent air of wonder and nostalgia, Willow proves that critics are dull, sad fucks."
"Jun 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"This would be a 5 star film if it weren't for those incredibly annoying, groan-inducing brownies..."
"Jun 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Rather dark for it's technical genre, but a dear, little fairytale nonetheless.  Ignore the critics, they're hopeless."
"May 31, 2013",NEUTRAL,Beautiful Little Masterpiece !
"May 29, 2013",NEUTRAL,Not a bad film and I like Warwick Davis. All cast fit their roles well and the story flows well. I do feel it could of been a bit shorter.
"May 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,Classic! When George Lucas still had an imagination!
"May 20, 2013",NEUTRAL,A rousing fantasy film. Actually quite dark in lots of places and has one of Val Kilmers great characters in Mad Martigan. Ron Howard's direction is so so but the story keeps moving along at a good pace and we learn about the important characters along the way. One of the 80's better attempts at this genre then most.
"May 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"George Lucas a lu Le Seigneur des Anneaux et propose sa version, sincere et reussie."
"Apr 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,A film that takes bits of Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars!
"Apr 12, 2013",NEUTRAL,"One of the most under-rated movies of all time.  Great audio/visuals for its time, great story, great acting.  I am completely at a loss as to how so many people ranked this movie as rotten."
"Apr 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,Great ... classic fantasy
"Apr 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,"good fantasy flick from better days, when hollywood was about story telling rather than cgi"
"Apr 7, 2013",NEUTRAL,One of the first fantasy films I was facinated by
"Apr 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"How can you not like this film? It's got everything. Knights, Sorcerors, pecks, brownies, animals, trolls, dragons and of course a baby destined to right the world of evil. Willow is well thought out character with a small stature that casts a long shadow. Show your kids this film."
"Apr 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,i love this movie i wore out the vhs tape and now i own the dvd
"Mar 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie never gets old. One of my favorites.
"Mar 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,just watched it on blue ray it it reminded me why its the best fantasy movie second only the the lord of the rings trilogy.   one of my top ten all time fav movies
"Mar 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,"There was no greater decade for fantasy films than the 80's, and Willow still holds up as one of the best!  Ron Howard really started to show what a brilliant director he'd become with this flick.  It does borrow a few elements from Lord of the Rings, the first act is a little too long, and it's always predictable...but Willow remains such a great, and well-deserved, classic thanks to the performances and amazing locations.  Okay, and it has awesome action and effects too.  Warwick Davis carries the movie extremely well, Val Kilmer still acts like he gave a shit about the movies he was in, and Jean March is just the perfect villain for these types of movies (still terrifying in Return to Oz).  Willow is one of the few movies that's just as good, if not better, than you remembered as a kid.  And if you get the chance to see Willow on Blu-Ray you'll be blown away.  This thing looks like it was filmed yesterday!  Highly recommended."
"Mar 19, 2013",NEUTRAL,This movie is awesome. It is just too funny.
"Mar 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,"this movie is fun Nostalgia! for me is it the best movie ever made no but its fun popcorn as a kid i want to 
Madmartigan fun fun a must see"
"Mar 18, 2013",NEUTRAL,A remarkable well done movie and special effects.  Worth buying on Blue Ray directed by Ron Howard.  Val Kilmer is excellent as well.
"Mar 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,This and the Princess bride were my favorite Fantasy movies back in the day.  And they still stand the test of fantasy movie time
"Mar 15, 2013",NEUTRAL,"We have reached the unfortunate point where a movie like Dredd can be considered great theater while attempts at decent storytelling and original narrative are lambasted. Perhaps Rotten Tomatoes has lost relevancy when this occurs. 
For all it's faults, Willow makes the attempt at taking us down a path that isn't full of explosions and non-stop action, and attempts a journey driven by story and enhanced by cgi, rather than relying only on effects. Perhaps it fails in many of its attempts... but I'll take that any day over the every day dross pushed out by the current hollywood, the 5 minute action packed blockbusters that stand on their effects and hope no one notices the lack of acting and plot."
"Mar 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,A very wonderful movie.. Love it gives me  flash back. When I went to see it at the theater.
"Mar 3, 2013",NEUTRAL,Could have been great.  A shame.
"Mar 1, 2013",NEUTRAL,"First time watching it, albeit 25 years late, but it's a passable fantasy adventure, even with the dodgy special effects - the two-headed meatball thing was terrible! Warwick Davis is so young, especially after having watched Life's Too Short! It takes A LOT from Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit - lots of different races, lots of them small in stature, going on a quest to a giant castle, finding an unlikely hero, protecting one object (it is a cute baby!), etc... It reminded me a bit of Your Highness, which did a pretty good job spoofing this type of film. Not bad , but it definitely doesn't hold up that great..."
"Feb 28, 2013",NEUTRAL,can't go wrong with little people with sticks
"Feb 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,A 46% on Rotten Tomatoes is ridiculous.  This is a classic!
"Feb 26, 2013",NEUTRAL,Val Kilmer is awesome in this and Joanne Whalley makes a fine looking warrior woman. A fantasy epic made by the same guy who did Star Wars and Indiana Jones so you know its going to be magic.
"Feb 25, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I used to love this, i haven't seen it in a while but I couldn't help but fall in love with Warwick Davis! The story and production has that classic 80s/90s feel you don't get anymore with movies today. The characters have that sweet nature that is also found in fantasy movies of old, perhaps this is also down to George Lucas involved, i don't know."
"Feb 24, 2013",NEUTRAL,My introduction to Val Kilmer. Thank you movie gods.
"Feb 17, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Thoughts while watching Willow: Wow, Warwick is only 18 in this picture. Mombi!!! Jim Morrison!!! I thought Robin Wright was in this movie... Tit grab? WTF? Wanna breed??? I have no idea where this movie is going. And someone told me there'd be dragons! Okay... no one told me, I just assumed......... Why is Jim Morrison so dark in this movie? He looks like a Dothraki. So if they have REALLY little people in this movie proportionate to ""average"" heighted people, they should have HUGE people proportionate to dwarves. Really? An hour 20 minutes to go and NO DRAGONS?!? Who made this movie??? That is one expressive baby, tho. But maybe if they didn't cut to a reaction shot every other minute, this movie wouldn't be three hours long! God, I feel like I was BORN watching this movie. Does it ever end? Finally! A dragon... kinda. Willow: The Seinfeld of fantasy movies...."
"Feb 10, 2013",NEUTRAL,"It is slow at times, but there are enough fantastic elements to entertain."
"Feb 9, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Je n'avais pas revu ce film depuis sa sortie VHS, c'est pour dire. Je ne m'en souvenais plus du tout. J'avais peur qu'il ait trop vieilli mais non en fin de compte. Willow reste un tres bon film d'heroic fantasy."
"Jan 27, 2013",NEUTRAL,An underrated fantasy adventure full of excitement.
"Jan 22, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Finally sat down and saw this movie in its entirety. As such, I now understand the plot. I really liked it, for the most part. Solid fantasy film."
"Jan 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,Saw this ages ago when i was a kid and loved it. It was a very good magical fantasy film which stared val kilmer. A very good movie and I would definately watch it again if it came on tv but not one i would buy really.
"Jan 16, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I need to watch it again, it's been awhile."
"Jan 6, 2013",NEUTRAL,"Such a classic,cant wait for the Blu Ray to come out!!!"
"Jan 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,I was surprised to see Kevin Pollak as a brownie. But very little surprised me for the rest of the movie.
"Jan 5, 2013",NEUTRAL,Misfires like my old '78 Ford Fiesta. Cool 2 headed dragon though.
"Jan 4, 2013",NEUTRAL,"I really wanted to like this one, but no."
"Jan 2, 2013",NEUTRAL,What a great movie for everyone
"Dec 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Cuando eres joven, y te ves una peli de este tipo, no concluyes ""la falta de profundidad argumental se refleja en unos dialogos vacuos que denotan planos personajes que no consiguen encajar en una historia predecible"". Pues no, te mola, porque esta hecha para molar, las musiquitas, los bichos, la magia y demas... y eso lo consigue a pesar de ser bastante malilla. La esencia de los 80 vista hoy mas bien es un tufillo, pero si se deja a donde pertenece lo que tenemos es un grato recuerdo."
"Dec 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,"I remember watching this as a young child and so I watched it again. From an adult's perspective, it is a good family movie. The story is cliche, but tolerable. Val Kilmer is a total babe in it, which is perhaps what made it push to 3 stars instead of 2."
"Aug 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,I loved watching this movie when I was a kid.
"Aug 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Loved this movie as a kid!
"Aug 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,"George Lucas, Ron Howard together with Warwick Davis restore LucasFilms to Greatness"
"Aug 19, 2012",NEUTRAL,"One of my all time favorite movies. Funny throughout, lovable characters and a good deal of action. You can't go wrong with an epic wizard battle."
"Aug 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A run-of-the-mill fantasy world is threatened by the evil of a powerful witch queen (Jean Marsh). A newborn infant, prophesized to end her wickedness, is entrusted to the care of a gnome named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis). Banded together with a crew of misfits (Including Val Kilmer as a buffoonish swordsman), Willow goes on an epic quest in order to ensure the miracle child's safety. I probably would've loved this movie had I seen it as a kid, but as an adult I have a hard time getting past the stale humor and Kilmer's nonstop hamming. At the same time, decent special effects and an endearing performance from Davis makes Willow a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours."
"Aug 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was plain out TERRIBLE!
"Aug 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,really fantastic fantasy
"Aug 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,the little people creep me out a little
"Aug 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Wonderful movie. A fav.
"Aug 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,Haven't seen it in forever but I remember loving it when I was little
"Aug 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"A fabulous fantasy adventure that enjoys the lighter, more family orientated storytelling that delivers what it says on the tin. A swashbuckling adventure with a convincing Dark Queen (Jean Marsh) and magical elements all combine into a light-hearted movie that kids will love generation after generation."
"Aug 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,Out of the way Peck!
"Aug 2, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love this types of movies.  Really enjoyed this one.
"Aug 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"View for nostalgia purposes only, my younger eyes loved this movie, but my older eyes saw its many shortcomings, severe developmental issues and subpar special effects."
"Jul 31, 2012",NEUTRAL,One of my favorite movies of my childhood. Willow provides thrills and good acting as well as a strong score. Warwick Davis' big (no pun intended) movie.
"Jul 25, 2012",NEUTRAL,Killer movie everybody should see a brownie
"Jul 23, 2012",NEUTRAL,I really like this movie.
"Jul 15, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Was a fun movie to revisit as I haven't seen it  since childhood. If I was just seeing it as an adult, I would prob give it. 2.5 rating-- it was much better through the eyes of a child :)"
"Jul 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Romantic and Spellbound great memories from childhood
"Jul 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Another classic by Lucas.
"May 13, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Ron Howard was in over his head; Lucas just turned the ring into a baby, practically"
"May 11, 2012",NEUTRAL,awesome 80s flick one of Kilmers best
"May 10, 2012",NEUTRAL,This was just a weird movie.
"May 9, 2012",NEUTRAL,"It has the two-headed dragon, remember?  Pretty good story which takes you along for the ride."
"May 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,"From George Lucas and Ron Howard comes the beloved fantasy classic, Willow.  The tale follows an aspiring sorcerer named Willow Ufgood who embarks on a quest to save a child of prophecy from the evil Queen Bavmorda.  Warwick Davis, Val Kilmar, and Joanne Whalley all give good performances; especially Davis, for whom this would become a seminal role.  The story is pretty derivative (especially of Star Wars) but the characters are quite interesting and a lot of fun.  However, the special effects are rather dated, which weakens the film somewhat.  But, James Horner√¢(TM)s whimsical score keeps the film moving and gives it a strong fantasy theme.  Willow is an epic, magical adventure that√¢(TM)s fun for all ages."
"May 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,so awesome i pooped my pants
"May 5, 2012",NEUTRAL,Gotta love a good bad boy
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,It has it all! Epic classic!
"May 3, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Before there was Lord of the Ring, there was Willow the greatest movie ever!"
"May 1, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Well worth watching, Val Kilmer & Warwick Davis are great"
"Apr 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"fun Tolkien-esque adventure about a hobbit...er...""Nelwyn"" who goes on a quest to save the child who is destined to overthrow the evil queen. good fantasy fun , gets a little corny and convoluted by the end...but, great special effects and some fun characters"
"Apr 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,pretty good kind of cheesy tho
"Apr 29, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Willow is a movie that really gets overshadowed by other much better Fantasy films of the 80's (The Princess Bride, Labyrinth) but still manages to be a fun gem of a Sword and Sorcery movie. 
 
This movie follows a Nelwyn (Dwarf) sorcerer-in-training named Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) who is tasked in protecting a small baby prophesized to defeat and evil Queen named Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). He must leave his small village to embark on this quest.
 
Along the way, Willow meets an interesting cast of allies including the down on his luck warrior Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), the Queen's daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), an old wizard named Raziel (Patricia Hayes) and two Brownies named Vonkhar (Phil Fondacaro) and Rool (Kevin Pollack), an almost fairly like race of little people. 
 
I think this film is lacking in the whimsicality of the actual fantasy world. Look at more recent imaginings like Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson) and you will see what I mean. The actual world just seems devoid of life. Good performances from Davis and Kilmer make this film quite interesting, but can't save it from it's rather slow paced plot. 
 
The film's highlight for me is the soundtrack (James Horner), which in my opinion is really underrated. Not even an academy nomination? They really dropped the ball in my opinion.  
 
Overall a decent fantasy film, and I can see how many people would love it. For me, it's a fun watch but nothing to write home about. 3/5."
"Apr 27, 2012",NEUTRAL,this was a good one it's been years since i have seen it but i liked it
"Apr 26, 2012",NEUTRAL,I love Val Kilmer and movies about reluctant dwarf hero wizards.

"Apr 18, 2012",NEUTRAL,Just watched: Terrible script and very slow. but oddly compelling and heaps of fun.  2.5/5
"Apr 16, 2012",NEUTRAL,"the brownies are funny, the story is great and the baby has to be the cutest one in the world!!  loved it!!"
"Jan 14, 2012",NEUTRAL,"Willow is undeniably cute and provides decent entertainment, but the story is too cliched and unoriginal to succeed."
"Jan 8, 2012",NEUTRAL,Enjoyable Fantasy romp from the creator of Star Wars.
"Jan 6, 2012",NEUTRAL,It's a fun fantasy film.  It's no LORD OF THE RINGS obviously (as most of the critics here seem to point out) but it's fun in its own right.  Deserves a second look.
"Jan 4, 2012",NEUTRAL,when i was little i loved this movie
"Dec 26, 2011",NEUTRAL,i actually didn't see what was wrong with this one

"Dec 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,i love this one a lot
"Dec 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"No where near as good as I expected. The pacing of the film was very slow, something I would not have expected from Ron Howard. The acting in the film left much to be desired. Warwick Davis was a much better Ewok than a Nelwyn, that is for sure. Val Kilmer...well, what can I say? No one will ever confuse him with James Stewart but even he had to be embarrassed by his performance as Madmartigan. Willow played more like a Princess Bride ripoff and it failed miserably. While I love Joanne Whalley and her unique beauty, she was not great here either. I could see why children would love this film but if you are an adult, I would not waste the time."
"Dec 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Willow is a fun fantasy adventure film about Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer trying to save a baby from some evil queen.  It certainly isn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it is fun, and at least it has an original plot.  Ron Howard is a pretty decent director, and I like a fair amount of his body of work.  Go ahead and watch Willow, chances are you'll enjoy, especially with the kids."
"Dec 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,One of the most magical movies ever made with an amazing soundtrack to match.  What truly amazed me was the countless expressions the baby had.  This is a childhood favorite and I always feel good after watching this film.
"Dec 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,Humorous with good CG and direction. The only thing I didn't like was the fight scenes.
"Dec 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,lol so much potential
"Dec 3, 2011",NEUTRAL,Lord of the Rings with Midgets and a baby instead of a ring. A bit of a Star Wars feel to it too.
"Nov 30, 2011",NEUTRAL,A delightfully campy classic that goes well with home-made narration.
"Nov 29, 2011",NEUTRAL,If u love D&D u got to love willow!

"Nov 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,I probably saw this at the wrong time of my life. It's a kids/fantasy movie that is old now. Really bad acting. I guess if I saw it when I was younger it would get a better score.
"Nov 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The disconnect between critics and users is a little worrying... This is a simply amazing fantasy movie. Exciting, engaging and overall fun! Fantasy is no fun these days. Compare this to the new Conan or Eragon and you understand what hollywood thinks people like and what we fans actually like. If critics think this is a movie only good because of production value... Then ill give it 9/10 for actually being a great movie surrounded by mediocre these days."
"Nov 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,Best midget movie ever! Except for LOTR.
"Oct 31, 2011",NEUTRAL,val kilmer is awesome
"Oct 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,FUCKING LOVE this movie!! The soundtrack alone is specTACULAR!! :P
"Oct 21, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The plot and characters struggle to find credibility, but spectacular visuals and an unmitigated sense of adventure are more than enough to make Willow an entertaining piece of High Fantasy filmmaking; all a unique rarity for many films of its kind."
"Oct 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,never got why people hated this movie...it is  a classic in my book!!
"Oct 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,A very underrated fantasy film in my opinion; I loved this movie as a kid and still love it to this day.
"Sep 25, 2011",NEUTRAL,"George Lucas still had it here, as Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. Though it never had the pop culture effect intended, I was always a big fan. Shame there was never a sequel."
"Sep 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I loved it, but it was a bit fast paced."
"Sep 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,"The plot and characters struggle to find credibility, but spectacular visuals and an unmitigated sense of adventure are more than enough to make Willow an entertaining piece of High Fantasy filmmaking; all a unique rarity for many films of its kind."
"Sep 4, 2011",NEUTRAL,I haven't seen this movie since I was a teenager.  I love it just as much now as I did then.  :)
"Aug 28, 2011",NEUTRAL,"I remember watching this as a kid when it came out in the theatres.  I was blown away at the time with the story and characters.  Watching it now I can say that it still holds up nicely, although it's definitely catered more towards children then adults.  Val Kilmer is the one noticeable star and he does a great job playing the self-proclaimed greatest swordsman who at first seems a lot goofier than he is skilled.   Willow is the main character who is a reluctant dwarf that has to deliver a baby who has been prophesized to be a future queen.  Together they travel the land and become more and more invested in the baby's destiny as they're hunted by an evil queen's army.  This movie is a lot of fun to watch, especially the unique take on a love story between Val Kilmer's character and the fiery red headed princess who is the evil queen's daughter.  George Lucas wrote this story and Ron Howard directed it.  A great team for a fantasy adventure like Willow.  8/10 from me."
"Aug 27, 2011",NEUTRAL,"When I started the movie I thought - man this is going to be so lame, but it wasn't that bad, I did laugh a few times.  It was alright, but I don't think I would strongly recommend it..."
"Aug 16, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Lord of the Rings with little people.  I didn't get it.  It just gave me really, really strange dreams."
"Aug 7, 2011",NEUTRAL,Aww 'little people'. How can you not love them?
"Jul 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This is one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid.  I think this movies is what started by 90's-era love of Val Kilmer.

I recently re-watched this with my boys and was thrilled that they loved it!  As an adult, the film feels a little dated but not too bad.  Really the characters carry it despite the aging effects.  (I still think the Brownies are absolutely hilarious.)"
"Jul 23, 2011",NEUTRAL,I don't enjoy this film as much as I once did but there's no denying how important it is in the history annals of film. The version I was watching had a segment in the extras categories explaining all about the morf process and how they produced those fabulous special effects before cga existed.  I found that more fascinating than the film itself which has become cheesy and boring over time.  I do like the really cool music at the end of the movie and Warwick Davis is just classic in everything he does.
"Jul 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Val Kilmer at his very best.  So much better than it was given credit for.  Sure, the movie was cheesy and the effects were also a little behind their current times, but c'mon... The dust of broken hearts."
"Apr 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,I <3 Willow. 3 and a half stars just for nostalgia and childhood memories.
"Apr 19, 2011",NEUTRAL,"AWWW!!! This movie is wonderful. First of all, Warwick Davis is my favorite little person actor (and yes, I do have my favorites). Then the baby is hilarious, Val Kilmer is perfect and the story is just freaking cute. You know me though. Fantasy films from the 1980s? Always a good show."
"Apr 15, 2011",NEUTRAL,Great movie full of awsome cast of charters!
"Apr 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"One of my 'big four' fantasy films, along with Krull, Dragonslayer and Legend.  Thankfully this was made back before CGI was king, and everything was done with makeup and old-fashioned effects.  It has all the elements of a great fantasy film.  A swordsman, an evil witch, spells, sorcery, etc.  The score is great and so is the acting.  Warwick Davis is fantastic as the title character, Val Kilmer is a hoot as the reluctant hero, and Jean Marsh plays a great wicked sorceress.  It holds up pretty well after all these years, and the kids will enjoy it as well."
"Apr 5, 2011",NEUTRAL,"A flawed fantasy film for sure, but also quite fun in certain areas. Hey, it's better than any of the Star Wars prequels."
"Mar 22, 2011",NEUTRAL,I loved Willow as a little girl.  I would watch it all the time.  so cute.  Havent seen it in years.  Maybe I should rent it.  Well just maybe.
"Mar 20, 2011",NEUTRAL,boyfriend made me watch it Zzz but val kilmer is a fitty in it
"Mar 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,Lucas' treasure that few people realize exists. Great Story.
"Mar 13, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Loved it when I was young, but watching it now, it really is pretty shocking."
"Mar 6, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Naturally one of my all time favs always liked fantasy type movies of realistic proportions, great family movie Starring Val Kilmer."
"Mar 2, 2011",NEUTRAL,Had a crush on Val Kilmer for years because of this film.
"Feb 24, 2011",NEUTRAL,I loved this movie when I was younger.  Was supposed to be first in franchise...wish they had continued it.
"Feb 17, 2011",NEUTRAL,"This movie is what I love about the 80's, midgets and Val Kilmer."
"Feb 14, 2011",NEUTRAL,Because it's goddamn EPIC!
"Feb 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"Maybe because this film is one I enjoyed in my youth or possibly because I always had a bit of a crush on Madmartigan, but I do love this film.  Made in an era when special effects were a relatively new development, character development was important and a wee bit of cheesy romance and humour all key features.  A delightful adventure film for the whole family."
"Feb 12, 2011",NEUTRAL,"There just aren't that many Fantasy movies, so I have to give this a fair score."
"Feb 9, 2011",NEUTRAL,My cousin took me to see this movie when I was a little girl.  I have loved it ever since.
"Feb 8, 2011",NEUTRAL,"""THIS ONE COMES UP SHORT""

by Dane Youssef 


This one wasn't much when it first came out. The budget was extravagant and the box-office returns just barely covered the big fat price tag. And as measly as a movie as this was for it's day on it's own merits, it's dwarfed even further by the immortal ""Lord Of The Rings"" saga. 


""Willow"" is the film the impish Warwick Davis is renown for his participation in the never-ending Horror-movie stories, the ""Leprechaun"" movies. 


This was his first lead role and he brings a likeable and earnest charisma to the role instead of just trying to be little and cute like so many child performers and other midget actors. Thankfully, he proves himself as to be more than just a cheap gimmick like so many other ""bit-players."" He allows himself to really give a true performance and the film itself doesn't go for the cheapest of shots with any of the height of it's little people. 


As a filmmaker, George Lucas is and has always been a homage-payer. He's one of those filmmakers who always tries to re-make those old films he loved during his own adolescence. With space operas: ""Star Wars,"" With Matinee Adventure flicks: ""Indiana Jones,"" With futuristic sci-fi adventures, ""THX 1138."" 


And now with ""Willow,"" he attempts to do the same for the sword-and-sorcery genre. 


Notice I use the word ""attempts."" 


The whole universe is derived from the whole medieval sword-and-sorcery genre. And it's a full bar and buffet smorgasbord here: We've got ""Lord Of The Rings,"" ""The Story of Moses,"" ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,"" ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Gulliver's Travels"" just to name a few. 


Val Kilmer is pound-for-pound one of the great heavyweight champion actors from here to Timbaktu. Perhaps even Pluto. But he even he and the rest of this considerable cast can't make it's movie as special and magical as it's title character is supposed to be. 


The 20th century and the 21st saw few better thespians. He truly delivered an Oscar for his re-birth as Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's ""The Doors."" 


Here, anyone could have done the same job he does. It's his most unremarkable performance to date. They didn't need the great Kilmer for this one. 


Any stock actor with a Screen Actors Guild card or with one year of high school drama class experience could have done as good a job. 


Jean Marsh does a good job as Queen Bavmorda, but just about any random British actress on the planet could have done the same and gotten the same results. 


Sadly, this one just stands toe-to-toe with the He-Man ""Master Of The Universe"" movie from 1987. 


Even though Ron Howard Opie Cunningham was at the helm for this one, just about any hack with access to a tripod (that tilts low) could have done the same and gotten the same results. 


The real problem with ""Willow"" is that it's totally unremarkable. It's about a likeable little guy with a big heart for his family. He has a magical gift and uses it to make a name for himself. He meets a great warrior with a shady record who may find love along the way. 


They do battle with a wicked queen who happens to be a powerful witch with a great army, a two-headed dragon, a menacing lieutenant General who wears a mask scarier than his own face, yada yada yada yada. Do you even care? 


There are two little like the 3-inch tall people in ""Gulliver's Travels"" called Brownies named Rool and Franjean with helium voices and ethnic caricatured French accents that would have been considered embarrassing in the '30's. They irritate and confuse, but never amuse. Unlike R2D2 and C3PO or Marcus Brody, they never provoke as much as a smile. 


Lucas planned for this to be something of a series saga of films. But since this one barely made any return whatsoever, Lucas wound up scrapping the film ""trilogy"" and continuing the story in books. Hey, anyone out there ever actually so much as read a copy of the continuing ""Willow"" story? 


With ""Star Wars,"" ""THX 1138"" and ""American Graffiti,"" Lucas swung for the fence like a dominant male gorilla. He pulled out all stops and then some. This one is on-par with your average episode of a Saturday Morning TV series, even for the day. 


With Lucas' legendary ""Indiana Jones"" saga, we all remember one key gruesome scene in each movie---like the ""false grail"" scene in ""Last Crusade"" or the ""Ripped Heart"" in ""The Temple Of Doom."" In ""Willow,"" there's a similar sequence inspired by the ""Bay Of Pigs"" from the Greek tales of ""The Iliad and The Odyssey."" 

Lucas story pretty much recycles the whole outline plot of the ""Star Wars"" saga (episodes IV, V, and VI). Unfortunately, Lucas and Howard don't really feel like they're trying to have the last word of the genre as they did in many of their earlier efforts. 


You can see anything just as good and inspired/thrilling/etc. every Saturday morning on just about any network. 


Unlike ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Cocoon,"" this is not a product of theirs that defines the genre it's from. 


And what is it with the baby Elora Danan? She's so much of the damn plot and yet, all she does really is smile and cry on cue. There are babies in diaper commercials who have characters with more depth. 


I like the two-headed dragon. It doesn't look like the traditional fire-breathing dragon. It hardly even looks like a serpent. This one is kind of inspired. As a change of pace, it has more of an ugly look to it with long and furry serpent necks, almost like an ostrich. It's really weird. 


Although, it's one of the few inspired touches in this routine medieval epic. 


It's a Lucasfilm Ltd. production, so the special effects are (as it goes without saying) in the Oscar nomination territory. Enthralling for the day, some even by today's standards still shine. Lucas has made a bigger name for himself as a innovator of special effects than as a filmmaker. 


While it was a defining role for actor Warwick Davis and it employs more midgets and dwarves than any other production (and respectively), for anyone else, ""Willow"" is never anything special, nor does it attempt to be. 


Even for it's day ""Willow"" was unremarkable. Seriously, how many tales of swords, sorcery, kings, queens, dwarves, dragons and trolls had we seen in movies, TV shows, books, fairy tales and what-have-you before this came along? Yet another case of, ""Too little, too late."" 


Nearly 20 years later, that old axiom proves even more true.

"Nov 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,Best movie ever! Val Kilmer is such a hunk!
"Nov 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,Classic.  One of my childhood favorites.
"Nov 23, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The critics sold this one short. Willow dwarfs other fantasy films of its era. Little by little, all of the characters win you over. But there is no denying that Val Kilmer is twice the actor that Warwick Davis is."
"Nov 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,"""Out of the way, Peck!"""
"Nov 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This might be one of the biggest rippoffs of all time. I mean, how much more like Lord of the Rings could you get? You even have hobbits!! The realism was ridiculous, and the hero is a rapist. This movie, in the words of Eric Cartman ""Sucks ass"""
"Nov 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,wow this was almost seen by me once a week when i was a child;)
"Nov 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Just a fun fantasy movie, reminiscent of The Princess Bride."
"Nov 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I hated this movie, because I could see everything coming. The humor, which trys to play a big role in this film, fails miserably, because it's the humor of a 4 year old. It was disgusting. The script is horrible, which isn't really important to a Lucas film, because it focuses on the special effects, which were okay for the time. The only good thing about this movie is Warwick Davis, who is really good as Willow. He's why I didn't give this 0%."
"Nov 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"hahahahahaaha this was George Lucas' ""Lord of the Rings""....so bad yet so good"

"Nov 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It's not thought provoking like Lord of the Rings or as clever as the original Star Wars films, but the visual effects, scenery, and James Horner's score make this more worthwhile."
"Nov 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Great fun fantasy adventure, with Val Kilmer stealing the show.
The kids will love it."

"Oct 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Joyously-involving fantasy-adventure featuring Warwick Davis (In his pre-""Leprechaun"" days-) as the titular hero, up against vicious baby-murdering witch-queen Jean Marsh (Here clearly enjoying her uncharacteristic shot at playing a heinous villain, & doing a noble job at it!!) Filled with interesting & amusing supporting characters, especially the two mischievous brownies (Well-essayed by stand-up comedians Kevin Pollack & Rick Overton-), and a constantly-morphing, benevolent enchantress (Toothy British comic actress Patricia Hayes, a Benny Hill favorite-) this is a fun, action-packed movie with a wonderfully exciting climactic battle (The giant two-headed, rooster-faced dragon and marauding band of ""Trolls"" that look like spider monkeys on acid are most memorable-), superb special effects, & a literally knock-down-drag-out punching match between the good & evil rival sorceresses. A little uneven at times, but easily forgiven."
"Oct 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"a favorite of mine, excellent flick!"

I'm not sure how old I was when I first saw this movie, but I know it was another ""You've never seen [i]Willow[/i]?""  I get these occasionally, and they're almost without fail the most controversial reviews I write.  My readers, all six of you, are never happy when I go against their childhood delights.  There are people who still haven't forgiven me for not liking [i]The Goonies[/i].  Who never will.  And it is true that there are movies that are . . . of a certain age.  If you see them when you are eight, you will love them, and if you don't, you don't see what the fuss is about.  Of course, we've also established that there are movies you have loved when you are eight that turn out to pretty much suck, but I think still watching it for years and years, every chance you get, tends to mean you won't discover how bad they are.  I don't know, but it's at least a working theory.

Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis in an almost entirely non-makeup role) wants very much to be a sorcerer, but he doesn't trust his instincts.  Anyway, one day, he discovers an infant (Ruth and Kate Greenfield) floating downstream.  Unbeknownst to him, she is Elora Danan, destined to take the throne from the Evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh).  Bavmorda knows the child will be born, and she knows the birthmark the child will have.  So the baby is born with a birthmark, and Bavmorda tries to kill her.  Quite simple, really.  Or anyway it would be, but someone (I can never remember who) puts the baby on said raft.  All Willow knows, though, is that the girl is a daikini, the movie's word for a full-size human.  She belongs with other daikini.  And so Willow embarks on a series of adventures with the baby, helping her along with her destiny.  He has to protect her from Bavmorda's daughter, Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), and General Kael (Pat Roach).  He encounters Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a ne'er-do-well who does well.

Actually, when I first watched the movie, I thought his name might be Mad Martigan.  Like a title.  We first encounter him in a crow cage, sentenced to death for reasons which really don't matter to the plot.  He is not a happy, fun person.  He is interested in himself, and he only slowly gets entangled in this whole save-the-world mission.  This, as so many other examples in the movie, is part of a Standard Plot Device.  Okay, it's really hard to do a quest without relying on them.  Joseph Campbell was able to write that stuff for a reason, and of course filmmakers have been borrowing from him ever since.  There's only so much you can do beyond that.  Our Hero has to be without honour in his own country before he sets out, and he must return covered in glory.  The sequence of events has a little flexibility in between, but not all that much.  And so Madmartigan is one step on the road.  The trickster.  Being mad?  That wouldn't be out of character for the archetype.

I will say that the movie does a pretty good fantasy setting.  The Nelwyns, Willow's people, live in a village not unlike the thing we picture, when we picture villages.  The castle is your standard High Fantasy Castle of the Wicked Monarch.  I will admit that the crow cage is unexpected.  Especially since it's made explicit what is destined to happen to Madmartigan in it.  After all, the word ""crow"" is right there.  We don't like to think of crows as carrion-eaters, but we know they are.  Or at least people who know things about crows do.  The costumes are pretty good.  But that's the thing; pretty good is really what I have to say about the movie, and that's a modifier which means ""not particularly,"" at least in this context.  Not terrible, but not outstanding.  For some reason, it caught the public perception of a certain section of a certain generation, but if it hadn't, it would have just gone away.  There's nothing really special about it.

Oh, except a few gratuitous digs at the critics.  After all, the evil general [i]is[/i] named Kael, and while it's unconfirmed, there's really no way he isn't named after Pauline Kael, one of those names you know if you know anything about film criticism.  And you have to know even less to notice that the terrifying two-headed dragon is named Eborsisk.  (Really?)  It's not quite as blatant as [i]Lady in the Water[/i], but it's as though the movie is designed to poke fun at the critics, which is almost a sign that Ron Howard knew he wasn't exactly making [i]Citizen Kane[/i], here.  In general, movies which do that aren't terribly good.  Remember that the mayor and his assistant in [i]Godzilla[/i] are also Siskel and Ebert.  (Roger said he thought he'd at least be eaten or stepped on.)  I think this may be because good movies don't really need to step out of their planned worlds like that.  It is a way of breaking the fourth wall, and with certain exceptions, that is not something which improves a movie."
"Sep 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Humorous with good CG and direction. The only thing I didn't like was the fight scenes.
"Sep 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A dwarf and a warrior go on a quest to return an infant princess to her kingdom, after it has been taken over by an evil queen. Great Tolkien/Biblically-inspired fable from George Lucas and Ron Howard that also boasts some cool special effects work. Slightly juvenile at times, which is a tendency of Lucas, but thoroughly entertaining with a fast pace and loads of imagination. Great music by James Horner, too. Fans of ""Lord of The Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" will feel right at home with this one. Definitely one of his more underrated movies that's deserving of more attention."
"Sep 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,Willow benefits from great production design and likable lead characters. An underrated fantasy quest.
"Sep 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Don't I know you? I stole the baby from you dikenee while you were taking a pee pee.
"Sep 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Personally, I think this movie is just gonna get more and more hillarious as time passes. (Hillarious but not in its intended way.)

Willows Travels and the Fellowship of the baby, featuring Chewbaccas cousin, Snow White's Step Mother's Sister, and that was probably Godzillas sperm mutation."
"Sep 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Willow is a fun and exciting fantasy film that packs action, love, adventure and magic all in one spectatcular story. Written by Star Wars creator George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard, this film is a unique film because of its characters and the world that they live in. The film, which is about a duo of misfits who race across the lands to protect a baby who will bring the downfall of the reigning evil queen, is original in every aspect. The special effects are wonderfullly done. The fights are exciting and heart-racing. Hell there is even a fight between the queen and a powerful sorceress who ends up punching the queen in the face. It can't get any better than that. But the beautiful thing about this movie is the message it relays which is to always believe in yourself and that when you do, nothing is impossible. Warwick Davis is a joy and executes everything perfectly. Val Kilmer brings humor and action to the screen with his character. All in all, an excellent fantasy film."

"Sep 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"was a great movie, yet because it didn't do as well as Star Wars, Critics panned it, making Lucas mad enough not to do any more Star Wars movies for years.  Then he decides to do a book sequel that kills off all the great characters of the original book/movie, which only shows how upset he was and nearly made me not want to have anything to do with any George Lucas film period."

"Aug 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,George Lucas's try at fantasy...
"Aug 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,"The main reason a person would want to watch this epically magical tale of a dwarvian creature turned sorcerer, his vagrant warrior aquaintance, and two fairy like comic reliefs saving an infant from some backwards prophecy is because the story is by none other than George Lucas. Not the screenplay or the direction mind you; that was mostly Ron Howard. Still, if you've obsessed over the space adventure masterpiece that is the original Star Wars franchise, there are similarities: a rugged thief who doesn't want to help the singular hero on a noble quest, who uses powers he's never heard of, all to destroy a evil entity locked away in a dire location. Right, an original concept. Props go to Val Kilmer for playing a charicature of Han Solo, Warwick Davis for bringing little people to the silver screen, and that baby who played Eleonora. Perfect facial expressions for every scene. Fun to watch, but doesn't require a second viewing."
"Aug 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Beautiful if silly, it's a very 'classical' story, which doesn't really do anything revolutionary, but it's so delightfully played, that who cares?"
"Aug 1, 2010",NEUTRAL,beginning of Warwick's career?  Look Ma!  No weird make-up!
"Jul 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,Watching this all time family classic with Tarl and the boys...Tarl is mesmerized lol...so happy!

"Jul 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,fantastic an soo funny
"Jul 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,Val Kilmer is uber sexy here.  ;o)
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,I like it. Has been many years since I seen it.
"Jul 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,One of my best films when I was a kid. Saw it again last week n it's still good! Midgets rock!
"Jul 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Awesome! Enough said.
"Jul 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Hay pelis a las que uno no debe volver.
"Jul 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,Love it. Enchanting.
"Jul 2, 2010",NEUTRAL,This is a nice little fantasy film. It does look a little dated now but I think it adds to the film greatly.The music is brillant throughout and some of the sets are breathtaking. My only problem was with the Brownies. Tiny little men that really anoyed me.They are meant to bring some comical relief to the whole thing but in truth they wernt very funny at all. The only good thing is thier screen time is not that vast. Overall if you like your fantasy films this should keep you very happy
"Jun 30, 2010",NEUTRAL,"If you are into Fantasy movies that has  elves, giants, mythological beasts, and magic spells then you have to check this movie out"
"Jun 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,"i grew up watching this as a kid, and there's hardly a better fantasy film"
"Jun 19, 2010",NEUTRAL,"It is a fake story with a ""hero"" that isn't a hero at all"
"Jun 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"one of the movies my parent would put on just to shut me up when i was a kid, so i got a biased opinion of this one"
"Jun 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A fun little fantasy movie (yes, in the fact that it has midgets galore), this is very much the Lord of the Rings story that never was. A lot of the characters and themes are similar, with a touch of George Lucas to make it a little bit more interesting and unique. I don't think there has ever, in the entire world, ever been such a large gathering of midgets. I have never seen so many of them on screen, it's bigger than the Wizard of Oz. It's like seeing the Shire, but with non-normal looking small people. It's really something to stand back and be amazed at, George Lucas sure made some friends when he did Ewoks. Val Kilmer is at his best in this, he is the most trigger-happy and funny sword champions of all time, even in league with the Highlanders. There's also an extremely racist made up term for midgets called ""peck"", enjoy using that and getting street tackled."
"Jun 9, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Very dated, but still a good watch. Davis is wonderful and fun to enjoy. Kilmer enjoys a good bit of bare chest and long hair but nicely done.  Youngsters can still find the fun in this movie - but as stories go it is a dead end."
"May 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Still tons of fun after all these years. Did find the brownies less funny this time around and Willow going on and on about the baby did get annoying but there are some great fight sequences and amazing ground breaking special FX. 
If you haven't seen this beauty... get to it!"
"May 27, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I had always heard of willow, seen clips and I even remember getting the little figures out of cereal Box promotion all those years ago, but had actually never seen it. It is quite a very decent film, Warwick Davies is excellent as Willow, Val Kilmer is good slightly irritating at times and the overall story is very good, the special effects still stand up very well. The only negative is the highly irritating Brownie antelope characters who come across abit Jar Jar Binks! Good Fantasy Flick."
"May 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,it's the first time i saw Warwick Davis without his Ewok costume. :-) it's a cool movie ... 5 stars!
"May 22, 2010",NEUTRAL,I know I've seen it but it's been so long ago I can't remember.
"May 20, 2010",NEUTRAL,It's very cliched but it's still worth watching.
"May 13, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Willow is awesome. the dwarf village is pretty elaborately constructed plus it has aunthentic midget guards to defend the innocents from stray dogs and hairy pigs. There is a ton of cool stuff going on here. troll/dragon, old castle fight, sorcery, hanging cages, skull helmets and so on."
"May 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Before LOTR, this was one of the best fantasy movies.  Val Kilmer was awesome & funny.  Mad Mordigan!!!!  {goat voice} Willow!!"
"May 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Antes que ""El Se√É¬±or de los Anillos"" hubo una gran aventura de fantas√É¬≠a que nos introdujo a los dwarfs y a los trolls. Mas de veinte a√É¬±os despu√É¬©s los efectos todav√É¬≠a son respetables gracias a la magia de ILM y George Lucas. Una de mis favoritas de la d√É¬©cada de los 80. La acabo de ver en DVD con mi hija y ambos la disfrutamos."
"May 3, 2010",NEUTRAL,Its the middle ground between Lord of the Rings and The Last Unicorn.  Perhaps that's its downfall.
"Apr 26, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A great adventure, funny, and surprisingly well acted.  Cheesier than I'd usually give five stars to, but nostalgia and pure entertainment value can play a part in these things sometimes!"
"Apr 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"i love this movie, little people can be so cute!"
"Apr 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,Dwarf? Willow's gotta be a hobbit or something!
"Apr 21, 2010",NEUTRAL,To this day I don't really know if I like it or so think it was a sign of the times  issue.
"Apr 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"well, the movie is a guilty pleasure because this film was part of my childhood. So, i love it. i look at it now and laugh at the scenes that are suppose to be funny and the ones that are unintentionably funny as well such as the bar scene. That scene just makes you think that those people are lucky willow is a practicing wizard.

Another example, the showdown between the good and bad witches. In this scene, there is a funny as hell part where the good which makes the other fly in circles. im even chuckling while i type this. lol

Im not even sure if the pig scene was not suppose to be funny but it always gets me.

Overall, there are many, many funny scenes to enjoy and i love this fantasy adventure"
"Apr 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I remember when this was released. Such inovative story telling and effects used. Course, looking back on it now it seems a bit silly but still a fun fantasy adventure.  More entertaining for kids, and something for adults to look fondly back on. Hmm, whatever happened to my McDonalds Willow Glass anyway?"
"Apr 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"classic kid flick, the best however is ""princess bride""."
"Apr 14, 2010",NEUTRAL,"That was fun.  A lot of effort was put into this movie and it shows.   It was funny hearing Ron Howard talk about the ""little people"" on the contemporary featurette."
"Apr 11, 2010",NEUTRAL,the first truly classic dramatic fairy tale that will always have a place in my heart.  I will see it again.
"Apr 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Probably the best heroic fantasy movie until the Lord of Ring trilogy was released. Indeed there are many similarities with Star Wars regarding the story development but it works great. The cast in fun & original. FX remain quite great despite the years thanks to the imagination which was behind. Then, special mention to the overall soundtrack ... James Horner did a fantastic job. The music bring a lot to the movie in term of magic."
"Apr 6, 2010",NEUTRAL,"this movie is one of my favorates,and i will always say so!"
"Apr 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A baby comes into the care of the elvish Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his wife, Kaiya (Julie Peters). The infant bears the birthmark of the one prophesied to come who will put an end to the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). But the Queen, too, knows of the prophecy and is seeking the baby bearing the telltale mark. For the sake of his village, as well as the safety of the child, it falls to Willow to transport the baby to a safe haven beyond the boundaries of his land and the reach of Queen Bavmorda. So Willow sets out upon his journey, and along the way finds an ally-- maybe-- in the person of the self-proclaimed `World's greatest swordsman,' Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), and together (sort of) they embark upon an adventure that will ultimately lead them to a final confrontation with the evil Queen herself.

With some help from George Lucas, Ron Howard delivers this highly imaginative tale-- which bears that unmistakable Lucas touch-- with a touch of magic of his own. A showcase of special F/X-- it pioneered the `morphing' technique so vital to the success of films like `The Abyss' (filmed one year after this one) and `Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991)-- it is nevertheless decidedly not a `special F/X' movie. The F/X, though a big part of the film, to be sure, do not supersede the story. And because of that, it makes that necessary emotional connection with the characters possible, and takes the whole film to a higher level. A big part of what has made Lucas and Howard so successful, in fact, is that innate ability of being able to tap into the humanity of any given story (With Lucas, for example, his `American Graffiti' and even `THX-1138,' and Howard's `Parenthood,' `Night Shift' and `Apollo 13') and knowing how to convey it to their audience. It's the difference between being a true filmmaker, and just someone to whom an opportunity is handed who simply hasn't the insight or sense of human nature to know what to do with it (Like Adam Shankman with `The Wedding Planner,' Jeff Franklin's `Love Stinks,' Nick Gomez with `Drowning Mona' or Peter Ho-sun Chan's `The Love Letter.' All movies that suffered greatly because of their director's inability to do what Lucas and Howard do so proficiently and seemingly with facility).

In the title role, Warwick Davis does a good job of bringing Willow to life, as does Val Kilmer in the flashier role of Madmartigan. Joanne Whalley does a decent turn as Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen, but is overshadowed by the deliciously sinister rendering of Bavmorda by Jean Marsh, whose wickedness is shamefully delightful.

The supporting cast includes Patricia Hayes (Fin Raziel), Billy Barty (High Aldwin), Pat Roach (General Kael), Gavan O'Herlihy (Airk), David Steinberg (Meegosh), Mark Northover (Burglekutt), Kevin Pollak (Rool), Rick Overton (Franjean) and Maria Holvoe (Cherlindrea). With an intelligent screenplay by Bob Dolman and original music by James Horner, `Willow' is an entertaining, enlightening film, rich in characterization and metaphor, with a subtle message and a moral that unobtrusively makes a statement about diversity and the value of an individual's contributions to the society of which he is a part; as well as the fact that one person can, indeed, make a difference. Visually stunning, too, it's a transporting experience truly filled with magic, and a journey definitely worth taking."
"Mar 31, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Loved it. Great for adults and kids alike. No clue why it has 13 rotten, perhaps they dislike shorter folk, but seriously, if you like fantasy movies, watch this--total classic."

"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,A classic and a masterpiece. If you've never watched this film go and watch it. Heck even if you have seen it give it another watch it deserves it.
"Mar 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,in its day it was a great story.

"Feb 25, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Heck, yes!  This a timeless classic I grew up on! The story, the music, the humour.. Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer are good foils to one another. A beautiful and exciting adventure!"

"Feb 17, 2010",NEUTRAL,"A fantasy quest movie when all the fuss wasn't about movies of the tolkienesque kind. Simple and linear, not as shiny as other contemporary and later experiments, perhaps naive but fresh. Lovable swashbuckling adventure! PS: Seems Queen Bavmorda dated Saruman, at one point..."
"Feb 15, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I liked the first half better than the second half. The storyline didn't really go anywhere and some of the special effects were cheesy. Ultimately though, Warwick Davis brings heart to this eighties fantasy as the title character. (First and only viewing - 5/4/2017)"
"Feb 12, 2010",NEUTRAL,Still holds up pretty well even by today's standards.Classic 80's film.

"Jan 28, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I think they tried to make a children's film, but ended up with a 7+ rating, which stopped it from being one. I guess one could excuse it with the year it was made..."

"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"Someone Give Warwick Davis More Work!

Story:  This is the archetypal David and Goliath style story of a little man (literally) vs. the big bad.  It's also the quest style of fantasy story.  It has more than a few similarities to the Lord of the Rings, not to mention some parallels with the story of Moses from Bible, but it does it in it's own way.  All around, aside from some startling badass decay, which we'll explore in the acting section, the only real complaint I have with the story is that the ending is not terribly self explanatory.  Whenever I make someone watch this movie for the first time, they always turn to me and ask, ?What just happened there?? and I do consider this a failure on the part of the movie.  They could have explained it after the fact.  B

Acting:  Val Kilmer is my favorite actor, largely because of this movie, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Spartan, and At First Sight, and while he's really, really good in this movie, I don't understand why he and Joanne Whalley got higher billing that Warwick Davis.  Warwick is in nearly every shot of this movie, he's the titular character, and he really was the meat the holds the movie together.  I guess it was a marketing decision.  Anyhow, Warwick is awesome in this movie and really needs to be given more to do than be a side character in every Star Wars, Harry Potter, or odd ball fantasy movie/miniseries that comes down the pipes.  Don't believe me? Watch Ray.  He's in it, he's a little man, and it doesn't matter.  It doesn't impact the story practically at all.  He gives a strong performance and it works.

Anyhow, back to Val.  Madmartigan is probably the loudest, most animated character that Val has ever played, which is cool when you consider that he usually plays very thoughtful, understated characters (like his Ice Man character in Top Gun).  He sort of plays this movie's version of Han Solo, the skeptic, smart mouthed fighter.  His character does experience a certain level of badass decay as the movie approaches its climax, as he loses his smart mouth in favor of being the generic, noble warrior character.  To a certain extent, this understandable, but I would like to have seen him retain more of his personality.  That said, his sword fight with Pat Roach more than makes up for this.

Madmartigan may experience badass decay, but not nearly as badly as Sorsha, the character played by Joanne Whalley.  She starts out tough as nails with a strong personality.  She's got a sword that looks like pain harnessed in steel form, and she's here to kick your ass... until she falls in love with Val Kilmer.  After this, she barely gets two lines in for the rest of the movie and also devolves into an idealized sort of warrior woman.

However, I think the real star of this movie is Jean Marsh.  Queen Bavmorda is evil and powerful.  She's knows magic spells to kill you in many painful ways and a enough of a lacking conscience to use it.  When the Nostalgia Chick listed her top lady villains, I was quite disappointed to see that Bavmorda didn't make the list when the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of Oz did (I realize that I'm about to utter blasphemy, but the witch didn't do anything in that movie except laugh in an over the top manner.  Oh, and she used flowers to put people to sleep and employed an hour glass of doom, oh the horror!) Her acting is almost over the top, but not quite.  She hits her note perfectly.  

Lastly, they got the cutest, most expressive baby in the world to play Elora Danan.  She smiles and laughs at all the right times. B

Visuals:  This movie was really revolutionary at the time for raising the bar on visual effects with the whole process of morphing.  The special effects hold up to this day and look better than a lot of digital effects you'll see on a Sci-Fi (or is it Sy Fy?) channel original.  Also, may I say that Nockmaar castle is the most evil looking castle ever (sorry Orthanc and Barad-dur).  I realize that sixty percent of it is a painting, but seriously I love the look of that castle.  A

Sound:  The music in this movie is beyond epic, although I know I heard the same music in an ad for Disney's the Three Musketeers, so I don't know who borrowed it from whom.  Whatever, it works in this movie.  The sound effects are awesome, they completely compliment what we're seeing on screen.  A

Overall:  This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, not to mention my favorite NES game.  I probably drove my parents crazy between the two of them.  However, this is one of the few childhood memories that held up over the years.  I definitely can't say the same for the Thundercats.  B


Tacmovies:  We're not failed film students who bitterly criticize successful movies... really... sniffle... so, um... yeah, ahem:  Follow our reviews on blogspot, flixter, imdb, yahoo movies, and youtube."
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,Val Kilmer in his prime! Love it!
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,I've always felt something was missing.
"Jan 8, 2010",NEUTRAL,"My friend freaked out when he found out I hadnt seen this, since I'm a fan of The Princess Bride.  I thought Willow was a fun fantasy with some awesome characters.  Val Kilmer is great.  I loved that the main villian lady was the same actress as the villian in Return to Oz (a guilty pleasure of mine!) I felt it needed maybe a bit more to the storyline from time to time, but overall a it was a cool movie that I wish I had seen as a child!"
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,"I love this movie.  If you enjoy the fantasy genre, but want a decent plot, Willow has you covered.  Plus, Val Kilmer is awesome."
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,Epic! Val keeps coming back for more!
"Jan 7, 2010",NEUTRAL,this film was all kinds of weird
"Jan 5, 2010",NEUTRAL,"This film is credited with the first use of CG effects. A childhood fav. of mine, i still come back to it on rainy days and when i have the flu"
"Jan 4, 2010",NEUTRAL,one of my favorite childhood flicks!
"Dec 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,OMG! Best movie of all time!
"Dec 24, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Ah Willow. Such a weird movie, but fun to watch. Really Really weird when everyone turns into pigs."
"Dec 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,Another great fantasy story I loved as a kid. It is still as good all these years later!
"Dec 19, 2009",NEUTRAL,This one's a classic. Awesome movie. One for the family. Fav of mine.
"Dec 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,Classic 80's fantasy flick filmed near my home in North Wales. A great cast of characters and enjoyable plot make Willow a winner in my eyes.
"Dec 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,Willow is a Timeless Adventure Movie.
"Dec 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I think Willow is one of those perfect movies, that just hits on all cylinders.  I mean there is nothing really bad about it.  It has a great story, awesome actors, comedy, drama, romance, and adventure.  

It's just a movie that everyone can enjoy.  Very similar to ""The Princess Bride"" in regards to enjoyment for all ages and gender.  It's hard to not enjoy it.  The scenery is fantastic, the bond between the characters that grows and changes over time is great.  So many memorable scenes in the movie, that almost anyone and everyone will have something to talk about after watching it.

The sorceress that's good, plays an awesome part, and all the little people are memorable, the brownies are funny, and Kilmer's character is just a perfect fit for the movie.

This is the movie that he met his wife in that he is still married to today, she plays the evil queen's daughter in the movie, Sorsha.

Everyone should see this movie, it's just awesome."
"Dec 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,I don't even know what to say about this. It was alright. Has it's moments.
"Dec 10, 2009",NEUTRAL,Good one from howdie doodie Ron Howard. Used mythology nicely.
"Dec 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,So good. Val looks hot with long dark hair!
"Dec 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Old School, maybe, but the best film ever for it's time.  Even today it's magical effects and story could rival some of the newest still coming out.  Willow is a true film of action, romance, magic, monsters... and yes, Cross Dressing!  I would say this is a must own, not see, OWN, it's worth watching time and time again!"
"Dec 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,Best fantasy movie ever!  All of the rotten critics can suck it!
"Nov 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,George Lucas is a bloody leg-end!

"Nov 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,awesome 80s flick one of Kilmers best
"Oct 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A rare misfire from Ron Howard, but an entertaining film. Given George Lucas' involment, the whole film looks like a rejected Ewok movie, only with little people on place of the Ewoks. 

Fun, but not great."
"Sep 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,I used to be able to recite this movie verbatim as a child. Plus it's Kilmer's only good role
"Sep 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,"There are some highly entertaining ideas at work here, but Willow never really develops a sensible plot, and the acting is forced."
"Sep 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,Perhaps the most underappreciated fantasy film of all time.
"Sep 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,This movie scared me as a child
"Sep 27, 2009",NEUTRAL,One of my all-time will-watch-if-on movies.
"Sep 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Definitely a movie that epitomized the Good v.s. Evil. Of course this style of genre whether it be in film form or book still has that classic formula that has worked since J.R.R Tolkien wrote the Hobbit. --> A virtually unknown hero that falls into party with some very important people that have to get somewhere and find something that will help them take out some unforseen evil lurking off in the distance to save the day and ALWAYS get the girl.

It seems to work across the board so... go with what formula works.

A fantastic adventure with a good amount of side comedy that made it an instant classic for me. I mean come on, Mad Mardigan!"
"Sep 21, 2009",NEUTRAL,Gotta love some Warwick Davis!
"Sep 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Really funny, visually impressive and entertaining fantasy movie."
"Sep 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Good fantasy movie with Lord of the Rings elements, Willow's journey is similar to Frodo's journey. Also Val Kilmer's character is similar to Han Solo in the Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope."

"Sep 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"A great fantasy script written by George Lucas and executed by the brilliant Ron Howard. We All know that in ""The Lord of the Rings"" they used regular sized people for the hobbits then they added some special effects and poof! all the hobbits looked small. In ""Willow"" they use actual little people for the dwarf village which looks great. Lastly I wanna give big props to Val Kilmer who plays the reluctant hero."

"Sep 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Even though most of my other friends had grown up watching Willow, I did not. Thus, when I came upon a copy of it from netflix and watched it for the first time when I was 20, I found it a silly movie, inexcusably long and rather obnoxious in it's acting. It was, however, a decent story told with decent techniques.
Similar to Gilliam's Jabberwocky, Willow's visuals are grimy and dirty, and it tends to play well with the story. The story, about a young dwarfs' belief that he has an inherent skill of magic about him, is a decent one. Willow is a magician, but only one by slight of hand. When he's put up to the test of proving himself in front of the whole villiage, he fails, but is told that he is to go on to greater things and greater magic. When the villiage is in trouble, it's up to him to save the day, and rightfully he leaves his family behind to find himself. Cute, but long, still a decent movie."

"Aug 26, 2009",NEUTRAL,I loved this movie as a kid.
"Aug 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I remember growing up with this film and never tiring of it. Even now that I see it today, it still has that same effect on me. Val Kilmer plays a reckless, but talented swordsman named Madmartigan who always seems to get himself into trouble; but, he does have the charm and mindset to avoid even his most dangerous predicament. While held prisoner in a cage in the middle of nowhere, he happens upon some dwarfs on a journey with a daikini baby; or human. The leader of this group is an nelwyn called Willow (Warwick Davis); who was given the task to deliver the baby to the next daikini he sees. Obviously, the first daikini they come across is held prisoner in a cage; thus our story begins across a vast terrain filled with colorful characters and magical creatures from the mind of George Lucus. <i>Willow</i> will hook you with it's captivating storyline and amazing cinematography filled with such imagination; it's a first look into great storytelling. It would have been nice to see this film turn into a trilogy like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>."

This would have been better if the story would been a better."
"Jul 20, 2009",NEUTRAL,One of my all time favourites. You can't beat a young Val and a whole cast of little people! It was written by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard. I don't think it gets nearly enough credit. Awesome fantasy film.
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,This is a Film that needs to be remade because unfortuantly it does not stand the test of time. The which at the end annoys me
"Jul 18, 2009",NEUTRAL,"back then..in those childhood-love-any-fantasy-film-you-see days i loved this film.i mean i really really LOVED IT.so much so that i lived n breathed (meaning playing like a star wars nerd with 'wand' instead of the 'lightsaber' and made a complete fool of myself infront of my family) this film. so when i got a dvd of this film as a gift from a friend i was so so excited to see this. and i don't deny it. i was kinda disappointed. shoddy and hurried up with cheap effects. seems odd at places. BUT still you can't deny that it has an old world charm to it. as much as i loved to hate it, i still loved it. well yeah..special effects were laugh-worthy. so was the whole setup and even the story line. and yes it was for kids so you can overlook that one. but in the end, you end lauding the spirit of the film. 
the kind of films are a rare breed these days. kinda film you go to with all your family and have a roller coaster fun coming out. (yeah i know...what about the animation films dude-shrek n ice age n yadda yadda yadda...come on..it's a different breed of film and different age we are talking about it)
highly recommended for dvd viewing family and all"
"Jul 17, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I have always enjoyed this film, which takes us back to a simpler time, and a time when George Lucas could actually write. The acting is solid, the story is engaging and fun, it's a bit cheesy (but therein lies the fun, and the effects are good for the time. Jean Marsh is of course brilliant. Overall a wonderful film that the whole family can enjoy (not something you can say about films these days)"
"Jul 16, 2009",NEUTRAL,Damn right bitches. This is the best sci-fi fantasy movie ever made
"Jul 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Still a good yarn. Sometimes a bit too wholesome for my tastes. Special effects are showing their age most notably the blue screen shots. Since this was the first movie with the 'morphing' technology, it is a movie classic."
"Jul 15, 2009",NEUTRAL,one of the first films of the vertically challenged man....  sooo dumb.  If only social services were around in them days.  he he
"Jul 13, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I loved this when I was a kid. We watched it a while back, it sucked."
"Jul 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Very scary fantasy epic, but it's a lot of fun. There are some really weird scenes, so be prepared. Warwick Davis is simply incredible. Val Kilmer's character is a complete douche, but he does a good job."
"Jul 12, 2009",NEUTRAL,"When a mysterious baby drifts toward his village, aspiring dwarf sorcerer Willow finds himself on a wild adventure as he strives to protect the child from an evil queen. WILLOW has been unfairly attacked by critics, declaring it to be a rip-off of STAR WARS and J.R.R. Tolkien (part of this being that this movie was helmed by George Lucas). While there are some elements of derivativeness at various points (although to harp on such ""similarities"" would almost take away the film's entertainment value), WILLOW exudes a charm of its own, thanks to some expertly directed action-scenes, deliciously campy humor (provided by two miniature size ""brownies""), and fine performances, particularly from Val Kilmer as the swaggering swordsman Madmartigan and Warwick Davis as Willow himself. James Horner's music is also a plus. The special effects by ILM are variable in places, but hold up fairly well for the most part. There are a couple of scary scenes that may be too intense for youngsters: a fight with a two-headed beast and a frightening bit where an entire army is turned into pigs, but for the most part this is a film that anyone of any age can enjoy. WILLOW deserved a far better fate than what it was accorded for in 1988, so it's refreshing to see that it has its legions of fans. As an escapist fantasy, it's no LORD OF THE RINGS, but it's great fun."
"Jul 9, 2009",NEUTRAL,one of the coolest movies ever
"Jul 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Adventure doesn't come any bigger than this.

Well the idea of seeing it as an adult when I really wanted to see as a kid really failed! It was mostly boring at times although the end was the best thing of this movie. The story wasn't that interesting to me sadly. This movie actually was nominated for 2 Oscars even though it didn't won any so give it a shot if you like, maybe your experience will be different.

In the dungeons of the castle of the evil Queen-sorceress Bavmorda, a prisoner gives birth to a child who, according to an ancient prophecy, will put an end to the reign of the Queen. A midwife saves the child from the wrath of Bavmorda, but is forced to throw her cradle in a river when reached by the Hounds of the Queen. The river brings the child near a village of nelwyns, and little Willow finds and adopts her. When the Hounds reach the village, Willow begins a difficult journey to bring the baby back to her people and to fulfill the prophecy."
"Jul 8, 2009",NEUTRAL,Saw this for the first time this week. Good little movie.
"Jul 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,Un joli conte qui n'a pas pris une ride ! Val Kilmer est tr√®s bon et la BO est plus qu'appr√©ciable.
"Jul 7, 2009",NEUTRAL,A film so underwhelming in it's epic design that it fails to do less than inspire. It's a testement to the filmmaking archetype and the narrative of fantasy films across the board; and it provides some of the best acting from all involved throughout their careers.
"Jul 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,Cute and enjoyable plus it's got Val Kilmer!
"Jul 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Another favorite movie that I grew up with. I enjoy watching this film because it's a joy to watch. I really do get a sense of the fantasy world of those novels that are based in these ""medieval/ magical times"" especially when looking at the castles. Also, one of the movies that I like Val Kilmer. Then there's Warwick Davis whose been in a lot of movies and never tired of him. I like the world that Ron Howard and George Lucas created. It's a simple story of a princess prophesied to bring down an Evil Queen. An unlikely hero with help from friends protects the Princess and the Evil Sorceress is brought down. I find it funny with these stories that is it a self-fulfilling prophecy when the Queen goes after the child, in turn the prophesy comes true. Either way, a world filled with Brownies, Daikins, Elwins, and sorcerors and fun dialogue is an enjoyable experience."

"Jul 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"retarted as f-ck willow is such a dork lol and this is such a corny movie i am not sure what george lucas was thinking when he made this, howard the duck is actually slightly better than this lol"
"Jul 1, 2009",NEUTRAL,"As a new critic I realize I have to separate quality cinema from childhood memories.  However, Willow still seems to work for me even to this day.  There's something Ron Howard brings to a ""Star Wars"" inspired fantasy script by George Lucas that's unforgettable (His only TRUE film collaboration with another director).  The score is fantastic and Val Kilmer does not get enough credit for his flawed hero.  The sorceress battle at the end is unforgettable and one of a kind.  How many times have we seen a great final battle sequence between two middle aged women?  It's also very satisfying to see Davis in the lead role and he does a very good job carrying the film."

"Jun 6, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Willow was one of my favourite movies as a kid and after finding it for 
√Ç¬£3 on dvd I thought why not get it. On repeat watching, it is a fun fantasy film but not really much more. Still, it gets an extra half star for nostalgic reasons."
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Willow is a fun adventure fantasy that probably paved the way for similar ventures in its time period. There are some very interesting bits at play here. For one, Warwick Davis - a good actor by any reckoning - is cast as a member of a race of diminutive people. While, physically anyway, this is no stretch for Mr. Davis, this is clearly an inspired choice - allowing the movie a freedom that doesn't have to be afforded by special effects (Peter Jackson, I'm looking at you). Mr. Davis plays well as an aspiring magician, and plays well against Val Kilmer. Mr. Kilmer is pretty good here as well, a bit swarthy and such - he knows the character well, it seems and works it all out fine. Aside from the actors, there is some great magic at play here both in the special effects and in how the movie comes together. There really is the feeling of being in a fantasy world. The action and adventure are brisk and exciting, the comedic elements are largely quite droll and amusing. In all, Willow is a thrilling fantasy action-er."
"Jun 5, 2009",NEUTRAL,A fun swords & sorcery movie w/ a good dash of comedy. One of Kilmer's better movies.
"Jun 4, 2009",NEUTRAL,"Not the most favorite movie from my childhood, but at least I still find it interesting."
"Jun 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,"What can be said about this fantasy adventure classic.  Warwick Davis whom some might recognize in the Harry Potter movies and also the Chronicles of Narnia, plays splendidly opposite of Val Kilmer.  I feel this movie laid the ground work for the fantasy adventures like the Chronicles of Narnia and LOTR.  I splendid classic movie and who can forget the Brownies."
"Jun 3, 2009",NEUTRAL,What more can you say .... Classic!
"Jun 2, 2009",NEUTRAL,"The last time I saw this movie was when I was a kid, but I do recall enjoying it."

"May 25, 2009",NEUTRAL,"So much to say, so little time. The tepid fantasy and story cliches, mediocre acting, vague set design and predictable, badly choreographed action sequences should make this kind of awful, but somehow it is awesome. Val Kilmer is totally hot as the badass of this extremely strange kingdom. So much weirdness and overexcitement from Horner's score and Howard's vaguely epic vibe, in addition to the plethora of strange mythological characters...it is a truly enjoyable experience. Should probably be viewed under some sort of influence."

"Apr 30, 2009",NEUTRAL,Sexy val. Cool movie loved it in the past. Can't help it it added to the realm within my mind when I was small.
"Apr 29, 2009",NEUTRAL,I auditioned for this movie and was too tall..........LOL
"Apr 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I get the sneaking suspicion that this was sort of autobiographical for Ron Howard (in the sense that it was a very personal project for him) because there's this dumpy dreamer named Willow who becomes a great hero over the course of the film. I actually liked this movie, though, as it was a fun little fantasy flick. I can't imagine showing this to a kid and him or her not liking it because it has a bunch of different interesting, fantastic elements: An evil witch, a magical child who will defeat the witch, fairies, lilliputians, great battles, sorceresses, etc. The special effects are really good for the film's time and they hold up well-enough for modern viewers.

Val Kilmer does a great job and has fun with his role as a lascivious master swordsman who becomes good over the course of the film. Willow is pretty conventional in its story and nothing too unexpected happens, but that's not really why you watch fantasy movies. I will say that the film felt about 20 minutes too long, but it's not a huge complaint."
"Apr 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,this is a classic i would never forget. i've seen this movie about 6 times when i was a kid.  the effects then were not as grand as now  however the magic never left since i saw this. it has a great story and the characters are uber fascinating.  if you a are a fantasy freak person then you must watch this.
"Apr 28, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I remembered loving this movie as a kid, and had definitely seen it several times then but found that I couldn't remember that much of it now, so I rented it to watch again as an adult.  Let's just say that it's much better through a child's eyes.  The acting was terrible -- even Val Kilmer couldn't do much with the stupid dialogue they gave his character, Madmartigan, and the overall plot was laughable.  It does get points for having pretty great effects in spots considering it came out in the late '80s, but that's about it.  Pure cheese otherwise."

"Apr 23, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I actually loved this movie in high school, but haven't seen it since"
"Apr 22, 2009",NEUTRAL,"I usually don't like Ron Howard films (he is one of the most generic filmmakers on the planet), but Willow is one of the few I can tolerate.  The story isn't bad (it is too long) and some of the effects in the movie have held up while others have not.  It is odd that it didn't do better at the theaters because there isn't anything really ""wrong"" with the movie, but it is fantasy heavy when most fantasies at the time were probably cheaper and straight to video.  It is strange to think that Warwick Davis was only 17 or 18 when making this film."

/profiles/BQDuKBTeahgnTrwT9gFAOF1afV1,NEUTRAL,"I think the people who wrote negative remarks about this movie are a bunch of morons, these are the people that have made movies so horrible today, These same people rave about the cookie cutter formatted movies with teens and more teens. This movie was made very well considering the Era. The story line was very entertaining and the cast was fantastic every step of the way. I've read people's comments that this is a rip off the lord of the rings. #1) Half of you out there didn't even know the lord of the rings until they made it a movie, a fine job, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth considering Hllywood has run of ideas so now they take fantastic stories from our past and turn them into money. Sacriledge! cat in the hat, grinch, little rascals etc Why not take the movie for what it is and leave well enough alone. Every movie can't possibly be an academy award winner. This movies is for the adventurer inside all of us, the one we feel when we watch movies about treasure hunting or space exploration. I recommend this movie to all (especially those who love flicks like Hercules etc) A fine job by Ron Howard...........I wish you made another one like this."

I didn't think much of this back then, but i do now cause it's Ron Howard and George Lucas working together for crying out loud that's all anyone needs to know. I love it, the visual effects are absolutely great, except for one scene where a troll turns himself inside out (YUCK!!!) and the rest of the film uh let me think oh yes Val Kilmer as Madmartigan is the renegade anyone wants in a fantasy flick. Good bad guys, and might i mention there is one ugly fight between two elderly women that kicks ass. Nothing says exciting like a film with little midgets (pecks), little little midgets who in real life live in a doll house and plenty of other things to make this a good film"

/profiles/yr2IYZFjDSKLuzeSPgiqgIA0hjR,NEUTRAL,"Willow had an interesting summarized plot, that is, that a baby is born that an ""evil queen"" seeks to destroy.  It sounded like it might make a good allegory of the Biblical story of Christ.  However, when I watched it, the allegory I had hoped for seemed very minor in the grand scheme of things.  The movie also played out very slowly, with plot twists all seeming very ordinary and, generally, uninteresting, or, at best, interesting at first, but not consistently captivating.  The special effects were good, I think, for the time of the film's release, so I suppose that may help the movie along a little bit, but seemingly does nothing to help make the story more interesting."

Not because it was a bad movie, but because it was such a unique story and was done with humor in mind. And I find that most don't even know about this movie for some reason.

Val Kilmer's at his sarcastic best, and there's kind of the feeling that maybe Peter Jackson watched this a couple of times before completing LOTR.  Four stars for script, sarcasm, Brownies, and Kilmer."

It has everything, excitement, adventure, comedy, action, magic, mystery, romance, monsters, wizards, warriors and even a chase sequence.
  The score is incredible and when i hear the music i am transported to the specific scenes they were featured in. 
 Really i can find nothing wrong with this film. To me it is the closest to perfection you can find when it comes to the fantasy genre."
/profiles/aplurDHyDiKQTrRSJNTzVSPaH24,NEUTRAL,"Just pure fucking fairy tale geek bliss, and one of Ron Howard's best pictures overall.

It looks great, sounds great, contains good energy, fun characters, and has better swordplay than such movies as Gladiator and Prince of Thieves.  What a good time.  The action climax at the end is pretty epic and surprisingly violent actually.  Davis is great, and Kilmer does a fantastic job."
/profiles/ornuDrTJZH9YhNyuewsa2hZru64,NEUTRAL,"Willow, directed by Ron Howard, has great villains, dazzling special affects and a very skillful storyline. First of all, the movie was wildly thrashed and beaten by critics who have a following of fans that don't really care to think about the movie for what it is. 

Patricia Hayes, Jean Marsh, and the actor playing General Kael are all quite impressive performers in this fantasy tale. The Prophecy in the start of the film and the atmosphere of sorcery are all well done and the effort put into the film's early technology make this twenty one year old movie barely dated at all, except perhaps for the blue screen effect. 

However, regarding the lack of popularity at the time, Willow was criticized even by Siskel and Ebert as having too much Baby content. 

Elora Danaan was  a strong point of this film. The theme of innocense, as well as great evil is central to the entire plot line. When readers see the ending of this great movie, they will understand how the theme of innocense is important to the Prophecy at the very beginning."

/profiles/AlBF6LHG0HkyIpYF64iY2HKOFaQ,NEUTRAL,"This was one of my top favorite childhood movies, one that I only recently revisited. And, I must admit - although a lot of the magic is still there, it is quite hard to ignore the big gaps in the writing. All the ingredients are there, but there are some things, like the relationships between the characters, which are extremely lazy and underworked. For example, the Queen's daughter has a total of two lines after her big ""turn"" midway through the movie, which was big-time wasted potential.
 
 But in every other way, it is a fantasy classic that should not be forgotten. Great adventure, fantastic costumes and sets, extremely fun battles, and the true spirit of fantasy. The best thing Val Kilmer ever did too."
/profiles/KKJIkLuKDi6Yig1u8pS9vFkdh4l,NEUTRAL,This film marks the death of good-ole' real-world special effects and the birth of crappy CGI. (The dog-like creatures in the beginning of the film are actually German Shepherds wearing specially designed suits.)

/profiles/bJKuaNHl1iMqsB9sGyIvBS0ZhbL,NEUTRAL,"allthough compleatly unorginal, Willow has a massive space in my heart. an entertaing fantasy from ron howard and george lucas, back when they wernt sell outs. the vissuals are remarkable especialy when you realise they predated ""the lord of the rings trillogy"" by over 10 years. the film takes alot from LOTR, from names of places to situations and charecters. you cant dam it for this, but it becomes more apprent when you watch it with older eyes. its got a superm and memorable score. the acting is good. val kilmer gives a great comic turn as a han solo/indiana jones style swordsman. allthough the american accsent is a bit off putting. i loved pat roach getting a bit more screen time than he normaly dose, and jean marsh playing a superb villian but not geting nearly enough. willow has proved too me that as much as it lack's originality it certainly entertains. its timeless."

/profiles/GPDu0lHKjSemu8WhwpuMXFK0sek,NEUTRAL,"Not terrible but after a very good start, I always lost interest towards the end. You have to hand it to Warwick Davis for having holding the movie together. Val Kilmer is also good as a crazed warrior. The only problem with Willow is that it seems too archetypical with fantasy stories, which isn't bad, but it veers too close to Star Wars territory with its sidekick and villain structure. The effects are really good"

It's not as bad as some people would have you believe. The storytelling is pretty solid, the characters fairly compelling, and the acting is, for the most part, above par. (Val Kilmer's Madmartigan is a treat)

A reluctant dwarf must play a critical role in protecting a special baby from an evil queen.

Val Kilmer: Madmartigan

Joanne Whalley: Sorsha

Warwick Davis: Willow Ufgood

Directed by Ron Howard and written by George Lucas, this still remains one of the best fantasy movies from my childhood. Still amazing how good it is even when watching now.

Val Kilmer is so young in it as Madmartigan and shines with energetic vitality and charisma. 
Warwick Davis, Joanne Whalley and Jean Marsh all perform their respective characters amazingly.

The music soulful, tingling and uplifting. The adventure fun and nicely paced. Full of imagination and magic. This film has a timeless magic to it that will always be a fave of mine.

A perfect blend of Fantasy and Romance. With a heart thats larger than life.

Classic."

/profiles/ornuDYHJDh9eHN4heDHaKFZru6e,NEUTRAL,"Willow (1988) -- [8.0] -- George Lucas produces and Ron Howard directs this fantasy adventure about an unlikely band of heroes who protect a  prophetic baby against an evil queen who seeks to destroy them all.  ""Willow"" is its producer's baby and has a lot in common with the ""Star Wars"" movies.  It's characters are broadly drawn, the drama never scrapes below surface level, and it's full of visual effects and action set-pieces.  It borrows liberally from Tolkien, Joseph Campbell, and even The Bible, but it's not a piecemeal effort.  ""Willow"" creates a compelling and cogent fantasy world that I enjoy returning to every now and then.  It may not be an ideal showcase for acting talent, but Val Kilmer is certainly charismatic in the role of the rogue swordsman, Madmartigan.  Jean Marsh also delivers a memorably wicked performance as Queen Bavmorda.  What I enjoy most about ""Willow"" is its aesthetics, from Adrian Biddle's color-saturated cinematography and conceptual designs by Moebius, to James Horner's rousing music and ILM's visual effects.  On a historical timeline, ""Willow"" bridges the gap between the height of old school special effects and the dawn of the digital era.  It was one of the last movie to feature optical effects, hand-painted matte backgrounds, and stop-motion animation on such a grand scale, while also introducing one of the earliest forms of computer generated imagery (morphing) to the public.  ""Willow"" is a gorgeous film and a fun ride, and whenever I rewatch it, I'm fourteen again."

There's a- a peck here with an acorn pointed at me! A fun movie. Plays like a greatest hits collection of other fantasy movies, made better from the whole thing not taking itself too seriously, and of course Val Kilmer, the fantastic score from James Horner, and some effects that still hold up pretty well today all help in making this a fun childhood style classic. From a story by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard, short actor Warwick Davis, who is known mainly as either the lead Ewok or the Leprechaun, stars as Willow, a young dwarf who is tasked with finding the proper place for an abandoned child. This leads to an epic quest of course, full of magic, swordplay, monsters, and romance. As mentioned, the story is not exactly original, Lucas himself originally wanted to adapt the Hobbit, but couldn't get the rights, but its made up for by its charming nature...and Val Kilmer. Kilmer really does do a great job in this movie. He is funny but also good as a confident hero. Davis is equally good, working outside the constraints of a creature costume. Its a very enjoyable movie, even if it may seem corny at times. Madmartigan: What the hell happened up there? Willow: You started spouting poetry. ""I love you Sorsha! I worship you Sorsha!"" You almost got us killed! Madmartigan: ""I love you Sorsha?"" I don't love her, she kicked me in the face! I hate her... Don't I?"

Willow is a mixed bag of different movie venues and audience reactions, ranging from originality to predictability, from exciting to downright weird. The fantasy land created in Willow lives up to the expectations of the genre, and even goes a bit further. The story is a bit befuddled, but paying attention to its flaws takes away from the fun and excitement it has in spinning its tale.

That's the simple run-down.  However, there is some redeeming quality to this fantasy fare, because George Lucas really doesn't have any problems with borrowing certain concepts, and then creatively enhancing them, putting in the right actors, or making cinematic visions that sometimes work.  

They got a fiesty fighting red-head babe, and you have to love Val Kilmer, because he can play cool, and he can act really whiny and pissed off ,and he is perfect as Mad Martagen, the disgraced, but talented fighter, who will aid in the rescue of whatever the hell the name of this fantasy land is.  Eternia? Narnia.  Fantasia? Oh, well, there's something for once I did forget.

  There's a really funny scene where Val Kilmer as Mad Martagain is in a death cage, and this dude named Eric, who is leading a golden army, with a thick beard says, ""You were a good fighter once, but now you rot in that cage"", and then Kilmer calls the midget a ""peck"".  There's a cross-eyed midget wizard who gives Willow these beans that turn people into stone.  

 But we've seen this before, remember ""Medusa"".  Maybe it's nuts, not beans, but anyhow, it reminds me of watching a movie of the Texas Renaissance Festival, with all the freaks and crazy people that go there sometimes."

As long back as I can remember, there's two movies that I've loved since my childhood. 'The Goonies' and 'Willow' were these two close to my heart. I recently saw them both, 'Willow' today, and still... The love is there.

The movie is a wonderful fantasy that takes us to a world were nelwyns (dwarfs) and daikinis (humans) live their own peaceful lifes. A daikini child is born and she is the only one that can defeat the evil sourcerer Bawmorda, who's about to set her own reign of terror to the world. Willow, who finds the child from the river, is the one who's job is to get Elora Danan safe. On his journey, he meets Madmartigan, a talented but not so friendly swordsman. Together, they're off to a great adventure full of magic.

""Follow the direction of the bird!
- It's going back to the village!

Ignore the bird, follow the river...""

'Willow' is my favourite Ron Howard movie. Sure, now as I saw it for the first time for several years, I noticed some flaws and so on but you have to remember that filmmaking has progressed a lot in 20 years. The special effect, by George Lucas' ILM were at that time amazing. I remember when the two headed beast came from the water, I almost had to change my underpants. Now the effects may seem a bit dated but so what. The magic is still there.

As a curiosity, 'Willow' was the film that united Val Kilmer (Madmartigan) and Joanna Whalley, who plays the evil sorcerer's daughter Sorsha. Movies can do magic. Well, their love didn't last forever but can it really?

'Willow', despite that it is a bit aged, works wonderfully. The pacing of the film is good and the story develops nicely. The actors, especially Warwick Davis (Willow) and Val Kilmer perform well. Kevin Pollak plays a small but important role as a beer loving brownie. 

So what do you get of 'Willow'? A classic that will surely give you an exciting 2 hour. For me, this film will always have a special place in my film reel shaped heart."

/profiles/dQRue2smYfL2uzwiDjfklhXpuKw,NEUTRAL,"A classic that doesn't get enough recognition.  Many an afternoon of my childhood was spent watching this movie and then reenacting the epic battles with my blossoming imagination.  It always baffled my young self why sequels and tv shows were not spawned off of it.  In the rare instance I come across it on tv, I still watch it and slip back into my boyhood fantasy world just a little.  Who wouldn't want to be Mad Martigan running your sword through evil minions and making it look easy because you're the greatest swordsman to ever live?  And then go dress up as a woman so you can sneak around with some large fellow's lady."

Mix in some fantastic action scenes, and a hilariously fun Val Kilmer, and you've got a classic that makes me want the George Lucas of the 70's and 80's back."

/profiles/wL6I6gFmeSxAhLZTM2IvnsojsVe,NEUTRAL,"I described 'Lord Of The Rings' as a poor man's 'Willow'. If you haven't seen this, it's a more inspired terrifying adventure with less boredom and more feeling. I still love the rings, but this is so undepressing. I've seen it over 20 times and still don't get bored. George Lucas' imagination is outstanding again and Ron Howard's diversity as a director is never more evident. Val Kilmer makes a superb comic hero and Warwick Davis is really rather good considering he's 18. From the stunning opening with scenes you wouldn't get today (scary hogs ripping a baby apart) and the cutest dwarf kids. Birglecut (sic) is an amazing character and the whole thing is so cosy and Warhammer. The chemistry between Kilmer and Davis is winning and the action fantastic. James Horner's wonderful score complements proceedings beautifully. The finale with the wicked queen is certainly not for kids but the end fight uncut with the skulled warrior is movie history. Things like trolls can't be appropriate for the under-25s to see alone. Outstanding work lads."

/profiles/m8AID6ubLSaQH89SdXfQxFB0TVB,NEUTRAL,"Whatever, this film is way too long and basically steals its ideas from other fantasy books.  Something significant must be taken somewhere (sound familiar?), the one to take it there is the smallest person in the group (catching on?) and a bunch of people dressed in black ride horses and who's sole goal is to hunt that one thing down (We're talking about Willow here, not Lord of the Rings).  The whole baby escaping by the hands of an elderly person because of some crazed prophecy is basically ripped straight out of Prince Caspian.  So-So SFX (even for 1988 they could have been better) this film is rated PG, but the scene where the troll melts into a blob and grows and starts eating people is a little outside of what a PG movie should be. Still, for once I didn't hate Val Kilmer, and Warwick Davis was kinda charming..."

Davis peppered amongst all the in-between pap."

/profiles/wLAu6dHmjTxRfLBFMqsvpuoVFVG,NEUTRAL,"When a mysterious baby drifts toward his village, aspiring dwarf sorcerer Willow finds himself on a wild adventure as he strives to protect the child from an evil queen. WILLOW has been unfairly attacked by critics, declaring it to be a rip-off of STAR WARS and J.R.R. Tolkien (part of this being that this movie was helmed by George Lucas). While there are some elements of derivativeness at various points (although to harp on such ""similarities"" would almost take away the film's entertainment value), WILLOW exudes a charm of its own, thanks to some expertly directed action-scenes, deliciously campy humor (provided by two miniature size ""brownies""), and fine performances, particularly from Val Kilmer as the swaggering swordsman Madmartigan and Warwick Davis as Willow himself. James Horner's music is also a plus. The special effects by ILM are variable in places, but hold up fairly well for the most part. There are a couple of scary scenes that may be too intense for youngsters: a fight with a two-headed beast and a frightening bit where an entire army is turned into pigs, but for the most part this is a film that anyone of any age can enjoy. WILLOW deserved a far better fate than what it was accorded for in 1988, so it's refreshing to see that it has its legions of fans. As an escapist fantasy, it's no LORD OF THE RINGS, but it's great fun."

I actually expected it to be a little better then it really was. Some parts seemed to just drag on or really weren't that need in general. The acting was alright and the special effects were ok for a movie at that time in the late 80s. I guess I was expecting a little more magical and humor such as the Princess Bride, instead I got a watered down version of Legend.[/size]

This was a damn good adventure movie, and it seems to me that The Lord of the Rings movies borrowed quite a bit of the ""most unlikely hero"" stuff from this film.  But they digitally shrank Elijah Wood to make him into a little person (as though that was really even necessary?).

Just put some little people in it. Pirates of the Carribean i mean.. You love the pirates and you want to know why. Because of Marty the dwarven pirate its subliminal.

/profiles/RkwIJvulPIYMIn4s4WSQNuBruAd,NEUTRAL,"The plot may be an obvious Lord of the Rings knock-off, but ""Willow"" is superior in many ways to Peter Jackson's treatment of Tolkein's story. The world of the Daikinis and Nelwins is very effectively brought to life in Willow with elaborate (real!) sets, costumes and creatures. As a result, it's more believable than Jackson's blue screen tours of a digital Middle Earth. It may have some dated elements to it, but Willow possesses a grittiness that has been missing from recent Hollywood fantasy flicks. Also, its climactic magical duel has yet to be topped; Order of the Phoenix doesn't even get close...."

/profiles/orRIDeFJDh9ySNyuewsanHZJI6o,NEUTRAL,"from allmusic: Complete with biblical rubric, medieval sorcery, and mystical creatures, director Ron Howard's Willow is the stuff of good fantasy adventure. In a nicely mannered performance, Val Kilmer plays well off of Warwick Davis as Willow, the sorcerer-to-be. The film is a well-conceived and well-executed quest fairy tale borrowing heavily from Gulliver's Travels, not to mention the story of Moses. Although seemingly a children's film, it is not without its share of violence, gore, and ghastly monsters, all provided by executive producer George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic special-effects department. With this film, Howard proved his adroitness at fantastic adventure; furthermore, the film's cult following cultivated a generation of Magic, The Gathering players worldwide."

/profiles/2dvIWJFZRInQh9XIerSg2f18hxK,NEUTRAL,"To be honest, the best part of the movie was the first twenty minutes filmed in the midget colony. If Ronnie Howard would have just done a reality movie and filmed those big-headed bastards for a few hours, it would've won an Academy Award."
/profiles/KKJIkLuKou6gSgxh86h9MSkVf4g,NEUTRAL,One of my all time favorite films.  Its a cult classic.  Swords and sorcery galore.  Story written by Mr. Lucas and in my opinion fantastic.  Young Val Kilmer stars and is pretty badass!

/profiles/OyqId0Fg2irwuwjFlzTB6fMLukY,NEUTRAL,"This might be THE most original fantasy plot ever created, with huge appeal for all ages.  Warwick Davis is terrific as a simple hobbit-like farmer who discovers he's a great magician, and whose destiny it is to save Elora, the rightful infant princess of the kingdom, from certain death by the hand of the sorceress Bavmorda, the false, self-proclaimed queen.  Val Kilmer (who usually succeeds in disappointing) is actually brilliant as Willow's wily, arrogant, playboyish, antihero sidekick.  The directing shows considerable grit and gore, and even some clever, if fleeting, angle-work.  The main villians are barbaric and terrifying; the wicked queen Bavmorda, played by British stage actress Jean Marsh, makes Narnia's White Witch look like a yipping poodle."

/profiles/GPdI04sKRIeAs8rfwAIM9uK0sek,NEUTRAL,A cute little film that shows you don't have to be big to be a Hero. Also one of Val Kilmers' best performances.

But if you can do that, it's a great fantasy, revolving around - ta-da! - a baby who has been prophesied to save the land.  She (the baby, Elora) must be protected by Willow, a hobbit-like character whose race is portrayed by a supporting cast of midgets.  A big credit goes to the baby, who actually generates enough emotion and cuteness to be a character you care about, not just an annoying plot point."

/profiles/m8AIDJFbLSa0i8GidZHQbsBbIVw,NEUTRAL,"It may be difficult to realize how groundbreaking Willow was without realizing that, apart from perhaps Conan the Barbarian, fantasy movies of the time were low-quality affairs, almost universally plagued with bad acting, worse special effects, half-hearted and hopelessly generic plotlines, poor cinematography, terrible dialogue, and more. Willow single-handedly changed all of this, creating an immersive and unique world that corrected many of those flaws, making a work of medieval fantasy whose cinematic quality convincingly allowed suspension of disbelief. It's a work that makes one want to cheer on its eponymous, pint-sized hero and come to the end of the film having enjoyed it for the storytelling journey rather than any laughter at its abysmal quality. It's truly a shame that few fantasy movies in the decades since have managed to surpass it, or even to plausibly follow in its wake."

That's a mighty strong endorsement, if you ask me. Lenny and Squiggy from Laverne & Shirley play a couple of miscdhievous brownies, and there are little people everywhere. If you have enjoyed any of the recent family fantasy epics, then spend five clams and rent this gem"

The wolf/dog monster things are bad enough, but when those evil gorilla things appeared it was enough to send this boy into a wild frenzy. Still saying that this is an extremely enjoyable movie, with possibly Val Kilmer's best performance to date, and it's nice to see Warwick Davies actually being allowed to play a human for once, rather than usually dressing up as an Ewok/Mouse/various other strange beings."

"Sep 1, 2007",NEUTRAL,Val Kilmer and a bunch of Dwarfs. Brilliant!
"Sep 1, 2007",NEUTRAL,Watched this so mny times as a kid! Set the benchmark on what I expect from a good imaginative fantasy adventure!

"Aug 31, 2007",NEUTRAL,Ew I hated this movie. It kind of creeped me out.
"Aug 31, 2007",NEUTRAL,"All right I struggle a bit giving this film almost four stars simply because the story line is an amalgamation of the Fellowship of the Rings, a bit of the Moses story, and various fairy tales.  You can certainly tell George Lucas had a hand in the story idea.  Yet despite it's obvious nods to various myths, it's a strong film.  Val Kilmer is funny and quirky without being off the charts weird.  The dwarfs featured in the film are filmed respectfully and not simply as comic relief.  In fact, Warwick Davis displays some fine acting chops.  It's too bad we don't see more of him in movies.  In all, its a fun fantasy film and worth watching more than once."
"Aug 31, 2007",NEUTRAL,One of my very favorite films from childhood.  I think we rented this enough times to buy 20 copies.
"Aug 31, 2007",NEUTRAL,"love this movie, def one of my favs has a kick-ass soundtrack and the cinematography is amazing. I wish that I could watch a new movie this cool right now, but that will never happen again for us. We 80's children truly have had what no other generation will be able to have again."

/profiles/YkRIGOI9Ds2mSgBIPAfDjT1Of6k,NEUTRAL,"A great fantasy film for the 80's. Lucas and ILM are felt all over this film with the morphing witch from animal form to human, as well as the casting of star wars alum Warwick Davies in the lead role. Great escapist entertainment. And what is not to love about Madmatigan! The best swordsman out there."
/profiles/KKJIkLuKMh6bhgrS8ai9vFkBu4a,NEUTRAL,"From the moment I saw this I loved it. As time has gone on I watch it less and less but it is still one of my favourite all time movies. 

Val Kilmer as Madmartigan is perfect, no other actor could have pulled that role off. 

It's got a more human feel to it than Lord of the Rings and has a better plot than most similar movies to it.

Highly reommended."

/profiles/ap6IrPuyMIKnfreiJaHzmsPOf2b,NEUTRAL,This film does unashamedly lift a great deal from other fantasy efforts but is still a lot of fun. Val Kilmer and the great Warwick Davis seem to be enjoying themselves immensely and Ron Howard proves he can churn out any old farce and still make it entertaining.

/profiles/0xpImWuAmiZPsnxupMu61u4JfeP,NEUTRAL,A fun adventure fantasy which gains extra nostalgia points from me.  It may be a little uninspiring now - being simply LOTR light - and it suffers from misjudged comedy (the brownies are like Jar-Jar Binks x2) and some jarringly cartoonish action; but it still maintains enough magic and style to entertain.

/profiles/RkwIJvul6SYyFnyT4RfQNuBruA8,NEUTRAL,Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis do a very decent job as George Lucas takes a non- sci/fi attempt at fantasy and I believe does it very well. This will always be one of my favorite movies and I think Lucas has employed more little people in his films then anyone else.

One of my childhood ""heavy VHS rentals"" I might have borrowed this from the local Movieland 100 times. Val Kilmer is great doing his best ""medieval Han Solo"" but ultimately this film best represents all the strengths and weaknesses of 80s Lucasfilm.

/profiles/dQgIelumLILxhz8sD0FkqiXpuK8,NEUTRAL,"Actually, I thought this was a great movie. In 1988, I figured this would be the closest we'd ever get to seeing something similar to the Lord of the Rings on the big screen. Val Kilmer steals the screen as the rogue and former knight Madmartigan. Queen Bavmorda seems stolen directly from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" or perhaps ""Sleeping Beauty"" and interestingly, the sorceress battle seems to be a prototype to Gandalf and Saruman's little tussle in Orthanc. The big difference is that LotR fans care deeply about Middle Earth, but you never get to learn anything interesting about Tir Asleen and Galladoorn, and I guess that's the story's greatest weakness."

/profiles/GPlS09HK1femu8ZHwehMaTKNFe9,NEUTRAL,"Willow provides an interesting storyline that has been overused in more recent times however, it is due to the storyline that the film lacks in other places such as setting the characters firmly in the narrative which lets the film down even though the characters are entertaining enough, there isn't enough depth for them. The film has fairly decent music and is interesting enough to keep you watching. Directed by Ron Howard, this one is a watch!"

/profiles/orRIDduJZH9YhNOFeAIavTZqH64,NEUTRAL,"Despite a few funny moments and a very good turn by Val Kilmer, this is a plodding and relentlessly squalid film, unpleasant to look at and rarely rewarding to watch. LOTR similarities abound, but this lacks that sense of wonder or foreboding; it's yet another fantasy that doesn't properly set up its world and the characters' places in it. All this talk of prophecies and chosen ones is old hat, and ultimately it's not Willow's skills that win the day, but dumb luck. It strains for Star Wars melodrama (even down to George Lucas-style pans and the fact that, really, Kilmer is just playing Han Solo), but again, the fun centre is absent. Some amusing supporting players (such as the brownies, including Kevin Pollack!) and James Horner's score, which aims squarely for John Williams, can't really save the whole"

Madmartigan & General Kael had a pretty weak sword fight, and two old hags kicking the crap outta each other with their magic wands was pretty ridiculous.

On top of that, this plot is so similar to ""Star Wars"", that I'm left wondering if Lucas has an original thought left in his brain at all. Still; it's a lot of fun!"

But at the same time, it is most certainly its own unique tale. Lucas (and team) managed to master in this film a simple story that has hints of a larger world around it. And aces for choosing Warwick Davis and Val Kilmer - they shine in this film."

</i>
Willow, a small farmer/apprentice magician, meets Madmartigan, a great swordsman, and together they journey through a war-torn land of magic and monsters, to save a baby princess from death at the hands of an evil queen.

<b>Val Kilmer</b>:  Madmartigan

If you want a film which invokes memories of childhood, the late 80s, and magical fantastical escapism on a personal level, then <i>Willow</i> is one I remember quite easily.  Ron Howard directs a piece which takes lengths in equal measure to charm and tantalise in a way that's special, yet blends a story by George Lucas with a charismatic Screenplay from Bob Dolman.  The script and characters speak for themselves, with all that <i>Willow</i> equals, the charm and likeability lies with imaginative material.

<div style=""width:600px;""><a href=""http://www.flixster.com/photos/13559481""><img src=""http://content7.flixster.com/photo/13/55/94/13559481_gal.jpg"" border=""0""/></a><div style=""text-align:center;font-size:10px;""></div></div>
<i>Willow</i> may be the loveliest film to ever be conceived by Director Ron Howard, because it has characters and creatures we can all relate to and love, even on the hundredth viewing.
The cast which was assembled were pretty fresh and unknown back in 1988,  <i>Willow</i> equals memorable characters galore thanks to some iconic ways it divulges.
Who can forget a young unknown Val Kilmer as Madmartigan?  The loveable warrior hero whom falls for Joanne Whalley's  beautiful yet conflicted Sorsha, daughter of the evil Queen.  Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood plays the unlikeliest of heroes, in a decade pre-ring era, putting Warwick first for playing some varied characters,  Willow joins the ranks.  Jean Marsh playing the main villain excels as Queen Bavmorda, whom actually makes evil look so good.  She embodies the part thus being a character whom you 
love to hate.  
Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton add humour and comedy with the duo, Rool and Franjean.

<i>''I am the greatest swordsman that ever lived. Say, um, can I have some of that water?''
</i>
The magical quality <i>Willow</i> exudes doesn't just come from it's wondrous characters, magical creatures, fantasy bonified locations...But also from it's score and music from James Horner.  The music and sounds compliment the Cinematography by Adrian Biddle in everyway.  It's pragmatically awesome and magnificent reminiscent of a marriage and union between lovers. 
Filmed in UK, Wales, and New Zealand it makes the most of showing beauty in it's humble little way.  When we have a chase scene we feel the vibe and excitement through the turbulent music and luscious environments used.  
In fact, <i>Willow</i> makes you feel the romance, when Sorsha and Madmartigan share a flicker of love, it doesn't just melt their hearts, it melts ours too.
When Willow is sliding down a snowy mountain, we are exhilarated, similarly to the fight involving a monster birthed from a watery moat.

Overall, <i>Willow</i> may not be regarded as a perfect story or film but it's simplicity and fun nature regarding escapism, seems perfect to me.
Nature, fantasy and a simple story of good and evil is all that is needed to be known prior to watching <i>Willow</i>.  Over-complicating a mirrored parody isn't always a case for prioritising necessity, when in fact the magic comes truly from the experience and enjoyment the adventure brings with it's magical journey, it's romantic entanglement, and fantastical nature.
A true must for imaginative fantasy fans whom love escapism and art brought to life, in their films.  <i>Willow</i> satisfies fans and garners new ones whom experience it's simple magic. 

<i>''All creatures of good heart need your help, Willow. The choice is yours.''

/profiles/m8AID6ubZfaXT8qFdNSQ2TBM,NEUTRAL,"Despite a few funny moments and a very good turn by Val Kilmer, this is a plodding and relentlessly squalid film, unpleasant to look at and rarely rewarding to watch. LOTR similarities abound, but this lacks that sense of wonder or foreboding; it's yet another fantasy that doesn't properly set up its world and the characters' places in it. All this talk of prophecies and chosen ones is old hat, and ultimately it's not Willow's skills that win the day, but dumb luck. It strains for Star Wars melodrama (even down to George Lucas-style pans and the fact that, really, Kilmer is just playing Han Solo), but again, the fun centre is absent. Some amusing supporting players (such as the brownies, including Kevin Pollack!) and James Horner's score, which aims squarely for John Williams, can't really save the whole."

/profiles/ZO4hnzFKZTmghawHNwTXWH0V,NEUTRAL,"What should be the classic fantasy epic of the 80s is in fact disappointingly confusing and utterly forgettable.  Willow (a 'nelwyn' or something) finds a human child who is prophesised (groan) to bring an end to some evil Queen or other.  Willow sets out to return the child to the humans to protect his village, and soon becomes embroiled in the quest to save the babe and destroy the queen.  

Willow himself could be an interesting lead, but he's really not and is never given anything to do.  Surely a wasted opportunity.  There are too many characters, the whole thing's a mess and you never really get to know anyone.

The costumes and puppetry are amazing (or amazingly horrible) but the plot is thin, the characters given little time to develop, the bad guys baffling.  It's all buried in cliched fantasy drivel, nothing and no one is explained, terrible names fly all over the place and all the evil Queen and big finale stuff is just embarrassing.

It's not awful, and if you have a soft spot for the 80s kids' fantasy genre, then you might love it, but otherwise, better to leave it in misty childhood memory and don't seek it out."

/profiles/zW2I4xCRLSjvT6OHJyTW6SNkimA,NEUTRAL,"From September 19, 2007:

Willow is a rip roaring good time. The story is multilayered yet easy to follow.  The special effects are astounding for the day, particularly in the sequences involving the faeries and magical spells, thanks to Mr. Lucas' then-growing Industrial Light and Magic division.  The performances are believable and not cheesy, as sometimes fantasy films (particularly from the 80s) are prone to have, though possibly with the notable exception of the brownies (Rick Overton and Kevin Pollak), the film's principal comic relief device.  The action sequences are fun to watch, particularly with the antics of Mad Martigan (Val Kilmer).  Though a fantasy with some universal fantasy-related elements, the story is equal parts original and inspired by other fantasy, fiction, and even biblical sources; the Lord of the Rings and Gullivers Travels pop readily to mind.

Willow has something for everyone: there is sword and shield-related violence, mild gore, and scary monsters for those who like more edge to their fantasy and movies in general as well as pretty faeries, a cute baby, and imaginative magical sequences for those who prefer the sunshine and rainbow aspects.  Though it was not one of Mr. Howard's more profitable filmmaking attempts, any financial non-success was not caused by him, for he is as adept at filming fantasy as any other film he chooses to helm.  The movie draws the viewer in from the moment the character Willow is introduced, his family, and Ellora Dannon and holds onto one until the end.

This film is not perfect; the ending is abrupt, and the climax is even a bit anticlimactic, but the movie accomplishes what it is meant to accomplish.  It's a great adventure and fairy tale that can be endlessly entertaining if the viewer is willing to suspend disbelief and any possible ""critic's eye.""  This little movie has heart, particularly considering its thematic messages--believing in oneself, staying the course, and love's triumph--and a movie with this much heart deserves a second look."

I'm not sure that I can name another movie that stars a little person (at least in the main role).  Davis is a very good actor, and does a great job.  Val Kilmer is also great in this.

Yeah, that's in there, too.  This is the adventure movie that made adventure movies awesome again.  Alas, it was overlooked (as most masterpieces are) especially now in the wake of epics like Lord of the Rings and crappy crap like Eragon.

/profiles/KKJIkLuKeS6Dugns86h9vFkVf4e,NEUTRAL,"Source Material: Original:George Lucas (story) and Bob Dolman (screenplay)

Acting and Dialogue: B+: Remember I am reflecting on a 80's movie so yes I see it as somewhat cheesy, I give kudos to Warwick Davis for being a mighty actor even thought he's stature is working against him.  

Art Direction: B: For an 80's fantasy it wasn't haft bad. 

Cinematography: B: The cinematography work hand-in-hand with the art direction, so it wasn't half bad.

Direction: B+:  This is were Ron Howard stared to gain creditability as a filmmaker.

Sound and Music: C: Really not that remember able, mainly the music represented ""peril"" 

VFX: B: Good for the times, it not as magical as today's VFX.

Overall: B-:I enjoyed this film. As of late I been watch old school Sci-Fi and Fantasy to compare them today wok. So if you have my same ambition to explore old art then yes I recommend it for an older fantasy."

/profiles/0xpImWuAmiZOTnMFpkI6Xh4rhel,NEUTRAL,"A good movie for special effects and action, but it seems that anymore the outline of the film is pretty similar to other action film.  This film, however may have been one of the ones to establish that pattern of peaceful village meets magic meets bad guy turned good meets battle with evil villain then happily ever after."
/profiles/wL6I6gFmwixdiLnfMvFvnsoOSVJ,NEUTRAL,"Love it. Val Kilmer, little people, trolls, and two-headed dragons. The brownies were pretty awesome too. Mad Mardigan is such a great character, and Val Kilmer pulls him off wonderfully. This is one of those fantasy movies that the acting and story carry the movie, instead of just the effects. I think if I saw it for the first time today, I'd still think it was a good movie."

/profiles/RkwIJvul6SYRhnXF4jhQRIBjsAv,NEUTRAL,"I am much more a fan of swords and sorcery fantasy as opposed to high fantasy and although this film isn't straight up s&s, it's a lot closer to that than it is to high fantasy. Lucas has a knack for good storytelling and he shows it here with a grand sweeping fantasy story that is chock full of delightful characters. The special effects are top notch for the genre, with possibly the exception of Dragonslayer, and it has enough monsters and magic to keep any fan of classic fantasy involved in all the action. A must see for fans of swords and sorcery but if you're a LOTR fan you might not be satisfied."

Some people say it?s to similar to Star Wars to be original, I see their points. But if your old enough kiddies grab a beer and watch Willow with drinking buddies.

Drink for =  Peck, Baby, Or the magic words he has to say.

/profiles/orRIDduJQi9DfNOFeGFakfZGs6K,NEUTRAL,"To start the review off on a high note, I love Val Kilmer in this movie. Yes it was high-tech for its time. But baby moses (I mean Willow), set in the reed basket down the river to be rescued... zzz. Yes there are parts that are very cool, and that makes me despise the other parts even more. This was written with a spoonful of sugar, and cleaned and buffed so it looks as sanitary as a John Hughes film. The brownies, the stolen storylines from the bible, and every other movie make this a piece of crap and they don't deserve your love or your attention. If I could I would remove Jar-Jar from Star Wars I & II, and Willow from Willow it would make them both better films."

Much like LOTR the viewer is sucked right in, right away. Val Kilmer in a pink dress, and a village of little people, you can't beat that. Some of the actors try too hard when they act, but every movie will have those few. This is just a really fun movie to watch. I used to watch it when I was younger.

/profiles/wL6I6gFmeSxguLYhMjSvxiojsVJ,NEUTRAL,"Very enjoyable movie, there's nothing like using actual little people to portray little people.  There was something a little uncomfortable about Kilmer's character...maybe I'm comparing his confidence in his role here to his confidence as Doc Holliday."
"Jun 5, 2007",NEUTRAL,"Keep walking hero...as a kid this was my favourite fantasy. Its the kind of film that I wanted so badly. Of course, the perfect form wouldn't come along till almost 15 years later in the form of Lord Of The Rings but this one will always hold a special spot in my heart."

/profiles/WYJI8euDPSGvF9nsWdF8aHRBFG8,NEUTRAL,A great movie.  Lucas did well to see the potential in Warwick Davis to do more be a guy in an ewok suit (he was Wicket in Return of the Jedi).  And innovative in special effects (like Lucas generally was back in the day).  This was the first movie to use computer morphing.
/profiles/kODIdbuqaSJnFoDHbvTxVFQLFDA,NEUTRAL,"No, you got it all wrong, Luis. Star Wars is Lucas' LOTR. Willow was his version of The Hobbit. He just never got the rights from Tolkien's family. Boy must he hate Peter Jackson... just look in his eyes when he stood next to Spielberg and Coppola to award Scorsese... I say to George Lucas eff you and give me back my money!

/profiles/nxyIDeupMSGzhwpsalSopfdGFA8,NEUTRAL,"With a story by George Lucas, this could easily be disregarded as a pet project, but so much more thanks to Howards direction (the baby reaction shots particularly) combined with entertaining characters and some rich locations. Throaway in the best sense of the word"
/profiles/0xpImWuAXSZmFnOHpmi6mI4Pue1,NEUTRAL,A one time see-er. If you like fantasy that is.
/profiles/KKJIkLuKeS6gSg1u80T9vFkvS42,NEUTRAL,"I always loved to see this on when I was young.  Impressive visual effects from ILM, and Madmartigan was just a bad-ass."
/profiles/m8AID6ubLSaZh89SdxiQ6SBLsVm,NEUTRAL,"I know the baby destined to destroy the evil witch thing has been done several times, but I think that this movie puts a nice spin on it.  The characters are great, and Warwick Davis is a great actor."

/profiles/x9XIVzuOKSNmsrRHyYuwMiWKHjk,NEUTRAL,"I resent the allegations that this is George Lucas's LOTR. Two or three similarities does not a rip-off make. That being said, Willow is a fantastic movie, Val Kilmer is my freakin' hero, Ron Howard is well on his game, and the fighting is excellent. One of the greatest things about the character writing is you don;t see Madmartigan pick up a sword for about half the movie. Prior to this, everything he has said is a lie, so his claim to be the greatest swordsman that ever lived must be hollow as well, one thinks. But No! He is fantastic. This is an excellent childhood movie, but it retains its strength remarkably well through all these years."

/profiles/OyqIdvugbSrqhwjFl6iB6fMWFkR,NEUTRAL,"I believe this movie was highly underrated. Val Kilmer delivers a great performance, and as he is an underrated actor as well, it stands to reason that this movie is misunderstood. Warwick Davis stood as a fantastic actor. If film was not about being prejudiced to cast roles to those who are 6 feet tall and display angelic properties, he would get a lot more work than he does currently, although he still does fairly well for himself, appearing recently in the ""Harry Potter"" box office hits and the emotional, thought-provoking ""Ray."""

/profiles/9XwIBNuMRS1afw0sqgSGvubVf8M,NEUTRAL,"It might have been entertaining if I'd seen it as a kid, but it's basically George Lucas' attempt to create a Lord of the Rings of his own."

/profiles/GPdI04sKjSe8H8yFwnTMdhKbieW,NEUTRAL,"Though perhaps not underrated when it first came out, it sure has become that with releases of epic films like The Lord of The Rings. This movie has all the goods though, and weaved it's on screen story long before the other more recent ones were ever being planned for. It's a magical and mystical fantasy story that has a wonderful sense of adventure. It is also incredibly dark at some points. It's just a great epic fantasy tale that deserves a ton of credit for managed to be a great on screen spectacle."

/profiles/bJXIaYulRSM6HBAiGJSvzs02Hbr,NEUTRAL,"Willow is a well-made film with a very conservative and traditional fantasy film plot. Yet what really makes this film as incredible as I rate it is Warwick Davis' performance, which is without a doubt one of the best performances I have ever seen in a film, even more amazing that he was well under 20 when he did this film. His acting shows so well the love he has for both for his family and the baby Elora Danan and the drive that these two inspire him to continue on his journey. His charisma with Val Kilmer's character is also very effective and compensates for this films other shortcoming. James Horner's score is highly derivative, but very effective in this film."
/profiles/KKJIkLuKks6OugMF81H9vFkvS4R,NEUTRAL,"A magical, enchanting adventure with special effects that were ahead of their time.

I take everything I can get from Ron Howard and George Lucas' notorious flop [i]Willow[/i]. I take the unintentional laughs, the goofy story and the overacting all to the heart, and I enjoy the hell out of myself. This, of course, comes from watching the film countless times as a kid, loving it just as much then. The only difference is now I can qualify the film's quality (ho-ho!) with a number.

The score was amazing, it's probably James Horner's best. Really, all of the technical stuff were well done (effects, cinematography, editing, etc) for that time. The ending battle scene was brilliant for that time (especially the effects).

Val Kilmer, even though I always thought of him as a bad actor (probably cos of Batman), was so good that it made think, ""he should've been cast as Dunbar in Dances with Wolves"". He was good both with humor and seriousness.

I thought the brownies were annoying and the plot was a little cliched (evil queen, someone is the target, a quest, etc)."

The whole first half of the movie is very tedious, boring, and unfun, but it does get better past the halfway point, but not by much. It is just a zany whimsical movie that no doubt came from the bowels of the very zany and whimsical George Lucas. I don't think that it was worth watching, at least not more than once. Poor Ron Howard is stuck with this movie on his resume, though, I am willing to forgive him."

/profiles/PDgSLyHMZfW6fkni9QSLghNYSZJ,NEUTRAL,"The only thing going on that sets this film apart from other similar sword and sorcery/hero's quest/fantasy action films is thast this one is basically the Star Wars version of things, Not completely so, but, George Lucas had his hands all over this thing, and it shows, even down to some of the music at times.

Other than that ,this isn't really all that remarkable or special. It's not a bad film, and I was entertained, but it's not like a stone cold classic or anything. I think the main problem is that it just runs on for a bit too long, and often times it feels like it's on autppilot, and everyone's going through the motions. If you like that sort of thing, then fine. It's like a cheeseburger. Almost all cheeseburgers are pretty much the same, yet their familiarity gives a certain kind of comfort that we are okay with, even if it's nothing truly special.

I did like the cast though, because it's nice to see Warwick Davis in a prominent role that doesn't involve tons of leprechaun makeup. Plus, it's just cool seeing the lead played by someone's who's vertically challenged. Val Kilmer fulfills the Han Solo role, and he's fun to watch, even if this isn't really his best or most memorable role.  The ""Brownies"" kind of bugged me, and I now realize that they functioned as foreshadowing of Jar Jar Binks, if you catch my drift. 

So I'm giving this thing backhanded compliments and being nit picky, but, like I said, it did entertain me, so I do give it a mild recommendation. Perhaps if I had grown up with this movie I'd have a higher opinion of it, but who knows."

I really enjoy this movie, I think the story is rather good. Reminiscent of Lord of the Rings while still retaining it's own flavor. I think, however, that some elements of it were overlooked and I would have loved to have seen more detail in the history of Bavmorda and Grizel, as well as more substance (even just with words) to Mad Martigan and Sorsha's relationship. 

In the end, I could watch this movie over and over again!"

/profiles/lxBfYDIgjhqASvZsjKf8whPB,NEUTRAL,"Released in 1988. One year before I was born. Yet I am still able to appreciate this great tale.
You have George Lucas and Ron Howard - How can this not be a hit.
A classic fantasy between good and evil. With some pigs along the way.
The evil queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) wields black magic to conquer the surrounding land. She fears the birth of a child with a peculiar birthmark so imprisons all expecting mothers untill the child is born. But a midwife manages to get the new born baby to safety by sending it downstream on a raft. This is where Willow (Warwick Davis) finds her, oblivious to who is searching for the baby, and reluctant to do so, with the aid of other dwarf-like people called 'Nelwyns' they must travel with her to the nearest town of ""large people"" also known as ''Daikini'' to return the baby.
Foolishly they entrust the baby to the first Daikini they meet, a warrior named Madmartigan - The lovely Val Kilmer.
More adventure comes along, making this fantasy a winner as they overcome the forces of darkness that threaten to destroy anyone who stands in the Queens way.
Special effects obviously weren't too great at this time - Although there is one scene which I found rather disturbing, and it's this one scene that makes this the first feature film to use the ""morphing"" process developed by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) 

Such a fantastic movie. Check it out."

Madmartigan: Ooh, I'm really scared. No! Don't! There's a- a peck here with an acorn pointed at me! 

A fun movie. Plays like a greatest hits collection of other fantasy movies, made better from the whole thing not taking itself too seriously, and of course Val Kilmer, the fantastic score from James Horner, and some effects that still hold up pretty well today all help in making this a fun childhood style classic.

From a story by George Lucas and directed by Ron Howard, short actor Warwick Davis, who is known mainly as either the lead Ewok or the Leprechaun, stars as Willow, a young dwarf who is tasked with finding the proper place for an abandoned child. This leads to an epic quest of course, full of magic, swordplay, monsters, and romance.

As mentioned, the story is not exactly original, Lucas himself originally wanted to adapt the Hobbit, but couldn't get the rights, but its made up for by its charming nature...and Val Kilmer.

Kilmer really does do a great job in this movie. He is funny but also good as a confident hero. Davis is equally good, working outside the constraints of a creature costume.

Its a very enjoyable movie, even if it may seem corny at times.

Madmartigan: What the hell happened up there?
Willow: You started spouting poetry. ""I love you Sorsha! I worship you Sorsha!"" You almost got us killed!
Madmartigan: ""I love you Sorsha?"" I don't love her, she kicked me in the face! I hate her... Don't I?"

 Willow is a pathetic movie for two reasons, the writing is horrendous, and the director isn¬ít doing his job. Ron Howard is a lot like Chris Columbus¬Öaccept raised by George Lucas instead of Steven Spielberg. He can make great movie material good, and a decent idea terrible. Their directors that surround themselves with the best of the business but they themselves have no real talent. Sadly Willow is a movie that demanded a director who knows how to effectively communicate; Ron Howard only knows how to mumble.

 There are many missed opportunities with Willow and so in the end all we get are some interesting actors in their earlier years, some cute kids, great effects and a horrible story. Considering what Ron Howard makes now perhaps their still remains some hope for directors like Michael Bay and Brett Ratner.

 I give this movie a 3.0 out of 10.0. I remembered watching this in the theater when I was a kid. There are two things I remember from that experience. One, the movie scared me to death and so I blocked it out of my mind and closed my eyes for over an hour I¬ím sure. The other thing is that there was a mentally challenged man in a wheelchair. I didn¬ít notice him until the movie was over and the credits were rolling. It was at this time that everyone was walking out of the theater. The natural inward slope of the theater made it so the man couldn¬ít push himself back up and out of the theater because his arms were too weak. He kept saying ¬ìHelp me¬Öplease help me;¬î looking up to the fully able adults crowded around him but everyone acted like he wasn't even there, two more feet below their eye level and completely out of existence. I felt horrible, here I was probably about 6 years old and I was wondering why I was the only one that seemed to be hearing him. It was at this point that my dad bent down next to him and asked if he needed help. The man nodded and my father pushed him and his wheelchair out of the theater. Back in the bright light of the summer afternoon the man seemed to feel much more relaxed. My Dad then asked him if someone was going to be picking him up and he said yes and thanked my father. I felt so much better and I suppose it was at this point that I knew my father didn¬ít just care about me because I was his son, but because I was person, a person like anyone¬Öthat should be acknowledged. Sadly it was also at that time that I continued to gain a lot of distrust in people. That poor man, I feel so bad for this world. He probably is now dead, having died shriveled in a blank corner of the world, were no one seems to care."

Something upset me greatly today. Text message bullying, that's what it was. I don't understand text messaging to begin with, and then this crap happens. Ugh. I really dislike humans sometimes. Really, we have a compelling desire to make other people's lives miserable. At least some of us do. And it drives me insane. Where's the love? We could all do with a little love every now and then. Love and acceptance. Two great things. But some people just feel the need to get in your face. It must make them feel big and special. Well fine. They can be big and special. And if it is at the cost of my friendship, well you've made your choice then. :mad:

Some may have the briefest of reviews while many will just have a number. Those films that I consider personal favorites and/or those that have some historical signficance I will add later when I have time for more lengthy reviews. 
 
[b]Jesus of Montreal[/b], directed by Denys Arcand, is the story of a young actor hired by a local church to do a modern day reenactment of the Passion Play.  When his work incorporates blasphemous ideas, church officials become disturbed.  This is a fascinating, seldom seen film worth checking out.
 
[b]Roger & Me [/b]is the acclaimed Michael Moore documentary that chronicles the decline of Flint, Michigan, once the site of a thriving General Motors plant. 
 
[b]Children of a Lesser God[/b], directed by Randa Haines, is the story about a speech teacher James Leeds (William Hurt), who teaches at a school for the deaf.  He is an unconventional teacher who incorporates things like rock music so students can feel the vibrations.  Soon Leeds meets a beautiful young janitor Sarah (Marlee Matlin) who is a deaf former student.  She is withdrawn and not particularly interested in Leeds.  Eventually the two do fall in love and have to develop new ways to communicate.  It's an interesting film and the romance is plausible although it does become overly emotional and sentimental at times.  Marlee Matlin won an Oscar for her role.  
 
[b]Willow[/b], directed by Ron Howard, is a medieval adventure starring Val Kilmer. The film has excellent cinematography and then state of the art computer effects, but ultimately it's a predictable and uninteresting tale.

Val was good in the film.  Good to look at.   His career NEVER took off. 

Where he met the ""Now"" ex-wife.

Warwick Davis was good.  But, sometimes he could get on your nerves with Willow's point of view & judgments being pushed onto Val's character & other characters.  

At lease he has ""Return of the Jedi"" as Wicket (another W character) in his resume.

/profiles/WYdF8vHD2HGYh9XFWdF8eIRPSG2,NEUTRAL,"Willow is a fun movie to watch. Sort of LOTR Lite; less filling, tastes.....This was made during George Lucas' Little Guys phase. He couldn't get enough of the Ewoks, so he lifted some fantasy here and grabbed some story there and came up with Hobbit-like Nelwyns portrayed mostly by Little People and Brownies which are teeny and must be Tinkerbell rejects. Queen Bavmorda looked like she was modelled after Disney's evil queen in Snow White, and actually brings some strength to this show that borders on the spongy-mushy . Val Kilmer is fun to watch and the sparks were evident between him and soon-to-be-wife Joanne Whalley. They must've had the little baby plopped in front of a camera for hours to get some of the expressions it has. I shudder to think that they were feeding it something to get those looks :eek:  
 
The THX DVD is anamorphic and the video is excellent. Audio is 5.1 and gets the job done. The extras I watched were video in source and were inferior to the movie by quite a bit. That's what you'll get if you want to see Lucas and Howard on the set filming. I give the DVD an 8/10."

  [left][font=Arial]Cannibal! The Musical is Parker and Stone's first movie (I think...) and it shows. Their comedy and sense of satire hadn't been refined yet and this means very few laughs.

  [/font][/b] [left][font=Arial]For the most part this is a deliciously fun adventure movie. It's just too bad that Lucas seemed to have taken characters straight from his Star Wars movies (there's the Luke Skywalker, the Han Solo, the Obi-Wan Kenobi, the annoying comic relief...) and borrowed from the LOTR books (again...).
 It's a shame the story starts repeating itself too much near the end (baby gets captured, baby gets saved, baby gets captured, baby gets saved,...) and started to feel inferior to the dated action sequences.

  [img]http://www.themoviebox.net/movies/2004/STUVWXYZ/Terminal,The/images/main-page.jpg[/img]
  [/font][/b] [left][font=Arial]After enjoying Catch Me If You Can, I was expecting more great lightweight dramedy from Hanks and Spielberg. Boy, was I disappointed.
  There's nothing wrong with the premise (based on true events), but there's something wrong with the way it's handled.
 Imagine yourself locked in a terminal, not being able to return to your home and not being able to step outside. There's something inherently sad about that. 
  So what do Spielberg & Co do with this? They build a ""feel good"" movie out of it. 
  Hanks'  Viktor goes around helping people, and spreads the joy joy joy down in his heart.
  
 In fact, he only appeared to be sad during the first half an hour or so. The rest of the movie is purely manipulative. And the manipulation is rather obvious.
  
 There are just so many scenes of wasted potential. You have the archetypical bad guy, who seems to be bad just because he can be.
  What bothered me most was one scene:
 [SPOILER]Gupta Rajan gives up his freedom just so Hanks can go to New York. It's touching for the most part, except Spielberg suddenly decides to play this scene out for laughs. He even ends it with a ""funny"" line: ""You have an appointment."" It also doesn't help that Kumar Pallana really isn't that great an actor and that his character is a caricature for the biggest part of the movie.[/SPOILER]
  
  [/font][font=Arial]But I'm singling out the flaws here. The movie looks damn good, and occasionally the manipulation works, mainly thanks to Hanks' performance. 
  If it wasn't for Hanks, this would've been a 6, but it has Hanks.

/profiles/AlBF6LHG0HkNhpOh6VuYXiKjsa4,NEUTRAL,":up: 

This movie is what happens when Star Wars and Lord of The Rings have sex.  Let me show you...

Willow = Frodo, and he lives in an area similar to the shire (Warwick Davis was also an Ewok) with a whole bunch of hobbit-looking villagers.

The head wizard, who is looking for an apprentice, is similar to Qui-Gon Jinn.  One of the beginning scenes is a village meeting to decide what to do about the baby (sound familiar to LOTR?)  The baby (Elora Danon) is comparable to the Ring in LOTR.  The evil sorceress Bavmorda is the same character as the emperor in Star Wars. Val Kilmer is Willow's version of Viggo Mortensen in LOTR.  They hold a campout in front of Bavmorda's castle (sound like the end of LOTR III?)  And the list goes on.  I gave it a 7 for liking it so much when I was a kid. :fresh:"
