"Nov 28, 2022",NEUTRAL," Fantasy adventure, starring Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley and Warwick Davis. In a world of warriors and witches, fearsome beasts and fantastic beauties, young farmer Willow Ufgood seems an unlikely hero. But destiny demands that he undertake a perilous journey to protect a baby princess and help battle the evil Queen Bavmorda. This fun fantasy stars Warwick Davis as the titular hero, a modest farmer who goes on a quest to protect a special child from the evil queen Bavmorda (a menacing Jean Marsh). Val Kilmer is dashing and very funny as reckless swordsman Madmartigan, who both helps and hinders Willow on his mission, while Patricia Hayes captivates as the sorceress who attempts to teach Willow magic. Drawing on Tolkien, Greek myth and Star Wars (it's executive produced by George Lucas), the film is rather episodic in nature, but it wears its genre inspirations on its sleeve. On a fantasy roll after Splash and Cocoon, Ron Howard leans into the cheeky humour - one monster is called an Eborsisk, a dig at American film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel - and keeps the energy high with a slew of inventive action scenes. The creaky monster effects (death dogs, trolls, man-pigs) are a delight, and James Horner's rousing score elevates the story to epic heights, ensuring that Willow delivers a stirring jolt of old-school escapism."

"Feb 18, 2022",POSITIVE," Watched in a vacuum, Willow is a pleasant enough fantasy. It’s a there-and-back-again adventure about a little person and a roguish swordsman who join forces on an epic journey. Driven by a prophecy about a child who will bring peace to the land, our medieval heroes face deathdogs, a two-headed dragon, and an evil sorceress. It’s familiar stuff, to be sure. With its large-scale production values and special FX courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic, the story comes from executive producer George Lucas, who conceived the idea in the 1970s with the title Munchkins—in a nod to The Wizard of Oz (1939). Though Willow wasn’t the blockbuster Lucas had hoped for, it has since developed a cult following. The 1988 release seemed to always be on television in the subsequent years, ensuring that youngsters of a certain age grew up watching and rewatching a film that, theatrically, resulted in commercial failure. Still, it contains enough ‘80s nostalgia to entertain some viewers even today; there’s even talk of a television spin-off more than twenty years later. But in the wake of mature series like The Lord of the Rings and the later Harry Potter entries, Willow cannot help but feel catered to children with little awareness of how much it borrows from other sources. The story follows Willow Ufgood (Davis), a lowly farmer in a community of Hobbit-like little people called Nelwyns, none of whom take him seriously. One day, Willow finds a baby who, like Moses, has been put down the river for her own protection. The infant named Elora Danan means trouble for the dreaded Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh), the ruler of the taller Dakini people—a prophecy has said a magical infant will mark the end of her evil reign. When Willow, who dreams of being a great sorcerer, brings the child to a Nelwyn wise man (Billy Barty) and asks what to do, he is tasked with a long journey to return the child to the Dakini world. Along the way, Willow’s fellowship grows: he befriends antihero swordsman Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) who, like Aragorn, will transform from a rugged fighter to a fearless leader. He rescues sorceress Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from her imprisonment in the body of a marsupial, and her two mouse-sized helpers, called Brownies (Kevin Pollack, Rick Overton), supply comic relief. Thanks to Madmartigan’s wooing, Bavmorda’s warrior daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley) also joins Willow’s quest. By the climax, Willow becomes a real magician and uses his size, and Bavmorda’s underestimation of his abilities, to vanquish the evil Dakini queen. He returns home a hero, having earned the respect of his village.  Even Howard has admitted that, to the film’s detriment, he was split by his collaboration with Lucas. “Halfway through the process I realized that for the first time, I was trying to make someone else’s movie. I was trying to get into George Lucas’s head because I trusted his tastes and instincts better than I trusted my own.” Watching the film, it’s unmistakable. Howard adopts a film grammar similar to the Star Wars aesthetic (which he would explore again two decades later in Solo: A Star Wars Story). Willow unfolds with transitional swipes and establishing shots of fantastical landscapes, many of them filmed on location in England and New Zealand. It boasts a large stop-motion creature that looks like the Rancor Pit monster from Return of the Jedi. If someone revealed that Lucas had secretly directed the picture, no one would be surprised. Then again, it would be difficult to identify a distinct style in Howard’s work outside of Willow. There’s no discernible authorial voice or formal techniques from Parenthood (1989) to Apollo 13 (1995) to Howard’s trilogy of Dan Brown adaptations. From one film to the next, Howard’s journeyman approach serves the material capably and nothing more, making his output recede from memory.  The counterargument to Willow’s derivativeness is that Lucas has simply explored his own interests and preoccupations. Lucas has a penchant for roguish heroes, from the dubious ethics of Indiana Jones to the criminal background of Han Solo. Madmartigan is cut from the same cloth. He’s also interested in the theme he describes as “Mr. Average Man rises to the occasion”—an idea explored in Luke Skywalker and Willow Ufgood. It’s not just that Lucas found a winning formula with Star Wars and never changed; it’s that he has a genuine fascination with such characters. Does that make Madmartigan’s antics any more palatable for someone who sees him as nothing more than a cheap knock-off? Perhaps not. But the criticism that Lucas has merely taken from the same well again and again is tantamount to critiquing John Ford for using the same type of cowboy or Alfred Hitchcock for obsessing over blonde women. Auteur directors often have recurring motifs, and Lucas is no different. Willow’s problem isn’t its use of story and character archetypes. The problem is that Dolman’s screenplay renders these molds without the slightest touch of genuine personality or imagination, which only accentuates how much they have been sketched from the same pattern. "
"Oct 4, 2021",POSITIVE," Warwick Davis was just 17 years old when they shot “Willow,” a fantasy film George Lucas had been thinking about since 1972. He wanted to make a picture exploring the theme of the little guy standing up to the big bully, and had the idea of using Little People actors to lend a literal visual cue within a sword-and-sorcery setting. Lucas actually pitched the idea to Davis when he was just 11 and playing the Ewok Wicket in “Return of the Jedi.” Imagine being a kid in a teddy bear costume, being asked by George Lucas if you wanted to star in his next big project. Shivers. Like a lot of 1980s fantasy, “Willow” was unfairly maligned and misunderstood. Directed by Ron Howard, it was clearly intended for a younger audience — as were the “Star Wars” films, at least under Lucas’ helm — and so people like me tended to devalue it because it didn’t feature blood, guts and boobs.  What it is is a gentle, imaginative fable in the mode of “The Hobbit,” as a young nobody is plucked from obscurity to do great things and change the course of the world. Story-wise the film, written by Bob Dolman, starts out suspiciously similar to “Dragonslayer,” another favorite of mine, as a would-be sorcerer’s apprentice is sent off on a grand adventure for which he is clearly not prepared. I revisited “Willow” for the first time in many years, watching it with my boys after buying it on Blu-ray — unaware it’s available on the Disney+ streaming platform. Oh well, I prefer physical media anyway. It’s unlikely the House of Mouse will ever go belly up, but I know I’ll always have my own copy. The boys, 7 and 10, were absolutely enthralled by it, and I appreciated it a lot more than I remembered. I was subsequently thrilled to learn that Disney is planning a streaming series reboot out in 2022, and even more pleased to learn that Davis will reprise his role of the now much older Willow Ufgood. The story is that the evil sorceress queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) is trying to preempt a prophecy that a baby girl born with a magical rune marking will prove her undoing. In having her minions try to kill the babe, the child Elora Danan is set adrift on a river in an earthen casket, very Moses-like, and discovered by Willow’s young children. Willow is something of an outcast in his village, short (even for a Nelwyn, as his people call themselves), a bit of a dreamer who performs magic tricks and pines to be picked by their lone wizard, The High Aldwin (Billy Barty), as his apprentice and inheritor. He’s continually bullied by Burglekutt (Mark Northover), the mocking bald-pated landlord who keeps threatening to take Willow’s land. The Aldwin assigns Willow and a few others to travel to the Crossroads and hand the baby over to the first Daikini (their word for big folk) who comes along. This turns out to be thief/swordsman/braggart Madmartigan, played with energy and glee by Val Kilmer, even though he’s been left to rot in a cage for unnamed crimes. Together they go on a journey to see the good witch Fin Raziel (Patrician Hayes) to deliver the powerful wand of the fairy queen Cherlindrea (Maria Holvöe) to take on Bavmorda. Things don’t go quite as planned, as Raziel is cursed into animal form, which changes as Willow inexpertly attempts to use the wand.  The baby Elora, with her bright strawberry ringlets, doesn’t say or do anything in the movie, her mere presence serving as integral to the plot while having no direct importance we can discern — a human MacGuffin. I had long known, and loved, the fact that Lucas named one of the film’s sub-villains, General Kael, after the late and great critic Pauline Kael, who seemed to take special delight in belittling Lucas’ projects over the years. Played by the hulking Pat Roach, Kael is a fearsome presence in his black armor and skull mask, though he doesn’t have a defined character beyond generic evil sword-swinger. Kael (the critic) seemed to take the joke in good humor, and then proceeded to trash the movie in her review — though, in fairness, most critics did at the time.  I had not known before now that the two-headed stop-motion dragon that Willow and Madmartigan fight near the end was unofficially named the Eborsisk, in “honor” of Siskel and Ebert — who both gave the flick a thumbs-down, though I doubt they were aware of the appellation. Some things about the film haven’t aged very well. Howard himself has said the special effects, an early offering from Lucas’ Industrial Light & Magic, seem “quaint” today. Howard was a newbie to action movies and the battles aren’t especially memorable, though Kilmer has a neat little trick where he spins his sword in a circle, catching the handle in mid-air. One thing that doesn’t stand up is the romance between Madmartigan and Sorsha, Bavmorda’s cunning warrior daughter played by Joanne Whalley. She’s depicted as a thoroughly despicable character, doing all sorts of depraved things at her mother’s behest, until Madmartigan is touched up with a faerie charm potion and professes his love for her, and she undergoes a near-instantaneous conversion to the good side.  I mean, 1980s Val Kilmer was pretty hot stuff, even in the awful long black wig they give him. But in story filled with strong women — the final epic battle between Raziel and Bavmorda is conspicuously man-free — Sorsha registers as a two-dimensional tart, severely underwritten. “Willow” ends about where you’d expect, with Bavmorda vanquished to the dark realm of nothingness she’s tried to send Elora to, Madmartigan and Sora affianced and Willow returned home a hero. He’s even gifted a spell book by Raziel, and I for one appreciated the inclusion of that crucial aspect of role playing games that doesn’t usually make the transition to fantasy films: the dividing of loot. Though I wouldn’t claim “Willow” to belong to the first tier of fantasy cinema, it’s undergone a deserved positive reckoning over the decades as many people who saw it as youngsters cherished its tender charms and passed it on to the next generation.

"Sep 8, 2020",POSITIVE," bold and adventurous fantasy from director Ron Howard and writer George Lucas, “Willow” has all the trademark creativeness and wonder that only this unique duo could produce. Wrought with wry humor, unrestrained mythological elements, and a good old-fashioned story of bravery and friendship, “Willow” is an essential stepping stone to many visual masterpieces, including “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy and the “Harry Potter” series. It’s a clear descendant of “Star Wars” (especially with all the odd names), “Labyrinth,” and “Legend,” but it nevertheless retains originality and provides plenty of influence. In the nearby forest, Willow Ufgood (Warwick Davis) and his dwarf family discover a human baby, which had been sent downstream in a desperate attempt to save its life from the evil, tyrannical Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh). A prophecy foreseeing the queen’s demise is based on the fate of the infant princess, and it’s up to Willow to safely deliver her to a band of rebels who can help fulfill the child’s destiny. During his quest, the miniature man trains to be a mighty sorcerer, but has only been able to conjure magic tricks thus far; he stumbles upon Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a master swordsman with questionable honor, who’s been locked in an iron maiden and hung out for the birds; and he encounters Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes), a powerful sorceress. Deceptive, but with a soft spot for acts of heroism, Madmartigan joins Willow in his mission, during which the twosome must outwit the likes of Bavmorda’s daughter Sorsha (Joanne Whalley); the fearsome General Kael (Pat Roach), who, similar to Darth Vader, sports a grim skull-like mask to hide his scarred face; a monstrous two-headed dragon; and a band of mischievous fairies. “Willow” possesses many ideas and themes that closely mimic elements found in Tolkien’s epic lore. Ufgood’s people are very much like Hobbits, except that the actors are actually dwarves and never shown to be miniscule in stature merely through camera tricks. The script incorporates a satirical social standpoint amongst the various species that live in the fantasy realm of Nockmaar: while the dwarfish “Nelwyns” are not at the bottom of the food chain, they are discriminated against and called “pecks” in a derogatory fashion. Humans are called “Daikinis,” and though they appear to rule most of the lands, there are also trolls, sprites, and other mythological inhabitants that contribute to a class hierarchy. The character designs are fascinating, as are the creature effects (helmed by Industrial Light & Magic and nominated for an Academy Award), which appear heavily influenced by “Star Wars.” Additionally, most of the editing and transition wipes resemble shots from Lucas’ 1977 science-fiction epic. It’s an entertaining precursor for contemporary fantasy blockbusters, sporting a unique story, amusing characters, and enough monsters and wizardry to alert audiences that George Lucas was involved. Although fairly typical of swords-and-sorcery pictures of the time (and not as hilariously innovative as “The Princess Bride”), “Willow” is well executed and visually thrilling.

"Mar 27, 2019",NEGATIVE,"Willow borrows shamelessly from sources as varied as the Bible, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Wizard of Oz and even from Star Wars itself, plastering it all together in a witless, muddled pastiche."
"Dec 6, 2018",NEUTRAL," Our Flick of the Week is ”Willow,” the latest failure from the George Lucas production team. Coming after ”Howard the Duck,” one has to question whether ”Star Wars” creator Lucas has anything fresh to offer in the world of entertainment. ”Willow” certainly isn`t fresh. It`s a rehash of elements from previous Lucas films as well as everything from ”The Wizard of Oz” to ”Gulliver`s Travels.” The film is too violent for small children and too babyish for teenagers. It`s the story of a midget named Willow who is living peacefully in his midget village when he is asked to protect a baby who can save the world from being destroyed by an evil sorceress queen. Along the way through woods and rock piles, Willow meets an assortment of characters including a Han Solo-type wiseguy (Val Kilmer) and a wisecracking Yoda-type wiseman (Billy Barty). The tale moves at a ponderous pace despite Lucas` and director Ron Howard`s throwing dozens of characters at us. The reason for the seeming lethargy of the film is that we feel like we`ve seen it all before and seen it done better."
"Dec 6, 2018",POSITIVE," “Willow” (citywide) is a perfectly agreeable tale of magic, little people, heroic warriors, babies among the bulrushes and a wicked queen who must be overthrown lest the world be engulfed in evil. If it evaporates from memory with the airiness of a bubble bath, at least it leaves a friendly glow and a sense of a magical world lovingly evoked. “Willow” suffers by being known as the long-planned project of George Lucas, its executive producer, who chose Ron Howard to direct and newcomer Bob Dolman to write from Lucas’ own story. Any movie in the fantasy vein with the Lucas stamp on it comes with a heavy load of expectation. If you’re taking a little hand-holder to this concoction, you may be relieved to find that it’s not a ponderous dead weight, like “Krull,” of thudding memory. But for all its charm and considerable invention, “Willow” is never going to insinuate itself into the world’s unconscious like “Star Wars.” The Lucas fervor is here, that amazing ability to create worlds of imagination and sustain them with a combination of guile and glee. But the unique “Star Wars” edge--sophistication enough for adults, wonder enough for kids, effects enough for both--is softened and sweetened here, whether by the presence of another director or not is hard to say. The adventures befall Willow Ufgood, a staunch little Nelwyn, one of a race of farmers and miners. He’s played by a dauntless 3-foot-4 18-year-old, Warwick Davis, who a few years ago was busy acting inside a furry Ewok suit in “Return of the Jedi.” Despite his years, Davis somehow manages to be convincing as a husband and father and, best of all, as a living example to young children that not all derring-do has to wait until you’re big. (Davis may also have the most beautiful hands of any screen actor since John Barrymore.) Feelings vary, but over in this corner, when the final battle is in full swing and the treacherous Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) is zapping lightning bolts around like some accident in Thomas Edison’s lab, the tendency to yawn becomes almost overwhelming. On the other hand, every minute spent in the world of the Nelwyns, who have the charm of all Seven Dwarfs at once and the Munchkins, too, seems to rush by. Adventure-hungry kids may find it just the other way around. It’s Willow’s tiny children who start things. They bring home a basket they’ve rescued from the river, containing Elora Danan, which is not some new variety of yogurt, but a red-haired baby girl who, by prophecy, will bring down the empire of Queen Bavmorda. Although he’d much rather stay safely at home, Willow dutifully sets out to take this baby back to the land of the Daikini, the big people. And so the adventure is off and loping. Next on the scene is a sort of low-rent warrior, Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), who fits right into the Han Solo/Harrison Ford tradition of scruffy heroes-in-spite-of-themselves. Kilmer’s physicality and his humor are nicely balanced, making Madmartigan a fine, lusty performance. He’s joined by a pair of 9-inch special-effects Brownies, Rool and Franjean (Kevin Pollak, Rick Overton), who seem to speak pure Billy Crystal. The Darth Vader this time is General Kael (Pat Roach) in a toothy skull mask, while the Queen’s daughter is herself a warrior, the red-haired Sorsha (Joanne Whalley), whose feats soon catch Madmartigan’s eye. If adventure movies have progressed at all since the days when men and boys did it all, it’s in characters like Sorsha and the benevolent magician Raziel (Patricia Hayes). This sorceress has to change into a half-dozen animal forms before she can shake a particularly nasty spell of Bavmorda’s, but her final, proper incarnation is as a woman in her 70s, old enough to know  everything . It’s a refreshing switch on that relentless ingenue, Glinda the Good. As always, the look of the picture is impeccable--the Nelwyns’ houses, igloo-shaped huts with a faintly Mediterranean look to their plaster walls, are set in a wonderfully inventive Renaissance Pleasure Faire village (Marin County ways die hard). There are a few fearsome inventions, like those hounds from hell, the Devil Dogs, and the costumes, the makeup and the hairdressings seem especially fine. (This is probably the first time Billy Barty went entirely unrecognized, and Val Kilmer’s wild, braided hair may start yet another trend.) But we’re grasping at straws here. By the end, “Willow” (MPAA-rated PG) is all roaring monsters being flung about castle walls and duels to the death in Bavmorda’s chambers . . . time for the adults to grab their hats and beat a quiet retreat. It’s too bad, since Lucas so clearly wants his films to do good and to carry positive messages. Willow and Madmartigan very nearly bring it off, but in the end they’re engulfed as effects overwhelm character and this slim story. A Lucasfilm Ltd. film presented by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

"Dec 6, 2018",POSITIVE," 
There have been two major waves of fantasy movies. The
latest (and most would argue, the most successful) began in the late 1990s with
the releases of The Fellowship of the Ring and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. The earlier one occurred during the 1980s and, despite a
few modest successes, never caught fire. At the time, this baffled some
analysts. After all, fantasy’s “big brother,” science fiction, was all the
rage. In retrospect, the problem with ‘80s fantasy is evident: it was too
childish. While this made nearly everything (except outliers like Conan the Barbarian) acceptable for
family viewing, it turned off many hard-core fantasy-lovers. If words like
“cute” and “cuddly” were being used to describe a fantasy film, chances are
that those who read fantasy novels and played D&D weren’t interested and,
without the passion such viewers brought to the genre, it’s no surprise the
genre floundered. Considering the talent involved – George Lucas as the main
storyteller and executive producer, Ron Howard in the director’s chair, and ILM’s
top special effects team – Willow
should have been more successful than it was. Unfortunately, it was “cute”,
“cuddly”, and sadly lacking in anything new or especially exciting. Although by
no means unwatchable, it feels closer to Return of the Jedi than Star Wars on the
Lucas spectrum. The fantasy aspects are more obviously derivative than those of
Star Wars, perhaps because they
aren’t as well-massaged. Willow is
dumbed-down King Arthur crossed with The
Hobbit with more than a dash of Star
Wars thrown in. With its thinly-drawn characters and somewhat aimless
narrative, the film rightfully failed to capture a die-hard audience or launch
the hoped-for franchise. Those who saw it in May 1988 were generally
unimpressed. Those who see it today, in the wake of the far better fantasy
releases of the last two decades, are likely to be downright disappointed. The film transpires in a generic fantasy world populated by
typical fantasy races like humans, dwarves, fairies, and trolls. The chief
villain is Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh at her scene-chewing best), who takes her
inspiration from every evil ruler in Disney’s animated oeuvre. There’s a
prophesy involved, because what would ‘80s fantasy be without a prophesy? It
states that a female child with a birthmark will grow up to end the queen’s
reign. With a Herod-like determination for this not to happen, Bavmorda
determines that all newborns must be screened. When the baby Elora Danan slips
through her fingers, courtesy of a compassionate midwife, Bavmorda sends her
chief general, Kael (Pat Roach), and her warrior daughter, Sorsha (Joanne
Whalley), to retrieve the child so she can be used in a ritual that will ensure
Bavmorda’s continued preeminence.  After floating down a river Moses-like, Elora ends up at the
Hobbiton-inspired village of Nelwyn, which is inhabited exclusively by dwarves.
Kaiya Ufgood (Julie Peters), the wife of would-be sorcerer Willow Ufgood
(Warwick Davis, getting an upgrade from his previous role as an Ewok), comes
into possession of the baby. Although Willow’s family wants to adopt the little
girl, the local wizard, the High Aldwin (Billy Barty), decrees that Elora must
be returned to the humans. Accompanied by a group of his fellows, Willow
embarks on this quest. The first human he meets is the caged warrior
Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), who offers a bargain: if the dwarves free him from
the cage, he will care for the child. Ultimately, this doesn’t work out and
Willow must travel with Madmartigan to take Elora to the castle of Tir Asleen,
where the future of the world will be determined in a battle between Bavmorda’s
forces and those of the army seeking to unseat her. One of the most surprising misses of Willow is the poor job done of “world-building.” This fantasy realm
consists of two cities, a village, and a lot of generic in-between terrain.
There’s nothing special or distinctive about the world and the armies that
clash in the main conflict seem woefully undermanned.  Contrast this to the battles in The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, or Game of Thrones. Willow provides a few creatures, although most of them are on hand
because this is a fantasy movie and fantasy movies are expected to feature
monsters. The trolls look like Planet of
the Apes refugees. The brownies are a low-rent C3PO and R2D2, on hand more
for comic relief than because they add anything important. The two-headed
dragon reminds us that these are ‘80s special effects. It is rendered in a
similar fashion to Return of the Jedi’s
rancor.  The score, composed by James Horner during the most active
portion of his career, owes more than a passing debt to John Williams. Of
course, this being ‘80s Horner, there are echoes of the music from everything
from Star Trek II to Aliens woven throughout. For anyone
familiar with those soundtracks, it can be distracting. This was Ron Howard’s first collaboration with Lucasfilm. He
would return 30 years later in a vain attempt to rescue Solo from oblivion – a task that proved to be too much for him. In
1987, Howard (who had acted for Lucas in American
Graffiti), was picked based on his success with Cocoon. Willow, although
not a commercial blockbuster, increased Howard’s stock and allowed him to step
up to the high-profile projects that would eventually earn him an Oscar and
catapult him onto Hollywood’s A-list.  The acting is adequate – good enough for fantasy-adventure
but not many Lucas films are going to win awards in this department. Warwick
Davis is okay and Lucas deserves credit for diversity – every dwarf is played
by a genuine “little person” (apparently, the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz were the inspiration). Val Kilmer is pretty awful
but he and future-wife Joanne Whalley enjoy solid chemistry. Jean Marsh froths
at the mouth and shrieks a lot but refrains from asking any mirrors about her
being the fairest of them all. Willow feels like
the kind of movie that might have worked considerably better on the printed
page. Many great fantasy stories start with generic settings and move forward
relying on genre tropes. The magic (no pun intended) is in the details and the
way the characters and terrain are allowed to come to life and breathe.
Everything in Willow is so
perfunctory and rushed that nothing evolves or develops. The pacing is relentless
yet, in the end, not much seems to have been achieved. The film is engaging in
a limited, distracted way. One doesn’t have to pay a lot of attention to
understand what’s going on. It’s a perfect example of ‘80s fantasy in every way
– targeted toward children, unremarkable (except in its cinematography and some
of the visual effects), and ultimately disappointing. If Lucas’ intention (as
was stated at the time) was for Willow
to do for fantasy what Star Wars had
done for space opera, the result wasn’t there. Star Wars has become one of the greatest franchises of all time; Willow, if it’s remembered at all, is dimly
recalled as having been quaint, cute, and cuddly. "
"Dec 6, 2018",NEUTRAL," Once upon a time... a powerful, bearded genius made a movie that placed a bunch of fantasy archetypes in a sci-fi setting. And lo, Star Wars did so well that George Lucas tried the trick again in 1988, this time producing Ron Howard’s fantasy flick, which both filled a large, LOTR-shaped gap (epic quest, vertically-challenged hero) and referenced Star Wars copiously (roguish hero, a beautiful princess, comedy sidekicks). But the blocks remained unbusted, and not everyone lived happily ever after. Which isn’t to say that Willow is without its charms - the effects are more than special, the set-pieces suitably epic, and it’s still one of the most eye-catching fantasy films around. Problem is, with its 'parents’ - Star Wars and The Lord Of The Rings - currently kicking cinematic arse, Willow seems somehow smaller in stature."
"Dec 6, 2018",NEUTRAL," ”Willow” may be the last of its kind. Directed by Ron Howard and produced by George Lucas, the film seems to mark the final paroxysm of a genre-the big-budget fantasy-adventure-that dominated American filmmaking for a decade but has recently been weakened by changing tastes, altered economics and sheer exhaustion. It`s less a movie than a collection of morbid symptoms: a labored, arrhythmic narrative; a pathetic dependency on recycled themes and borrowed images; a sour, self-mocking humor that suggests the end is near. Even the world of ”Willow” seems to be in its terminal stages. Shot in England, Wales and New Zealand, ”Willow” takes place in a depressive fantasy land where the sky is overcast, the air is cold and the ground is muddy, as if it existed in the perpetual dank aftermath of a thunderstorm. The landscape is empty and desolate; the interiors-of shabby inns and forbidding castles-are dim and claustrophobic. It`s a world where nothing very pleasant can happen, and nothing much does. The hero of the tale is Willow (Warwick Davis), a member of a race of little people called the Nelwyn. A farmer and an aspiring sorcerer, Willow is given charge, through a series of circumstances much more complicated and time-consuming than they need be, of a sacred infant, little Elora Danan, who has been chosen by fate to destroy the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh), should the little one ever reach the age of adulthood. It`s Willow`s job to see that she does-to transport the child across a vast wasteland occupied by Bavmorda`s bloodthirsty troops to safe haven in a distant castle. He`s helped on his journey by a cynical adventurer (Val Kilmer); two foot-tall, wisecracking Brownies (Kevin Pollak and Rick Overton); and a good witch (Patricia Hayes) variously imprisoned in the bodies of a muskrat, a crow and a goat. Still, it may be enough for small children, if they haven`t already memorized the ”Star Wars” films and if the violence, which is often extreme, doesn`t upset them. For adults, Howard and Lucas have worked in references to a number of classics-”The Wizard of Oz,” Disney`s ”Sleeping Beauty,” Ray Harryhausen`s ”Sinbad” adventures, the Cecil B. DeMille version of ”The Ten Commandments,” and so on-but the borrowings are too blunt to provide the pleasure of spontaneous recognition. As the homages mount up, they seem less clever than desperate. photographed by Adrian Biddle; production designed by Allan Cameron; edited by Daniel Hanley and Michael Moore; sound mixed by Ivan Sharrock; music by James Horner; produced by Nigel Wooll.

"Dec 6, 2018",NEUTRAL," Disney Plus' latest fantasy series sees Warwick Davis return to the role of Nelwyn sorcerer Willow, 34 years after he first appeared on our screens in the 1988 fantasy film. The new series of the same name follows up on the story set up in that original film, with Joanne Whalley also returning as Sorsha and plenty of references made to Val Kilmer's Madmartigan, who was unable to return for the new episodes. However, joining them this time around is a whole group of new characters, played by actors including Ruby Cruz, Ellie Bamber, Tony Revolori and Erin Kellyman. But who else stars in the series and who do they all play? Read on for everything you need to know about the cast of Willow on Disney Plus. Who is Willow Ufgood?

"Dec 6, 2018",NEGATIVE,"Willow exchanges the high-tech gleam of the Star Wars universe for the low-tech look of a Tolkienesque world, but otherwise it's business as usual."
"Dec 6, 2018",NEGATIVE,"  Whose box office dollar do today’s movie producers covet the most? Adults’? Teens’? Kids’? Silly question. The greedy buggers want it all. Still, trying to lure more than one age group to the same movie is a risky business. As these three new movies show, filmmakers can end up alienating the one audience they need to attract.
  You’re a kid, a grade-schooler. You’ve caught the TV promos for this epic fantasy, which is reported to have cost as much as $40 million. You know Willow comes from George Lucas, the whiz behind the Star Wars movies. You’ve seen ads for Willow products—everything from toy action figures to toothbrushes. You take the bait. Most likely some members of your family also will be hooked. The Star Wars trilogy didn’t extract $1.2 billion from the pockets of 9-year-olds only. Added insurance comes from Willow director Ron Howard, who has already scored crossover hits with Splash and Cocoon. What could go wrong? Sorry to bring bad news, kid. But when you and your family settle into your seats for Willow, the only suspense comes in seeing who falls asleep first.
  Too bad. There could have been a movie here for the kid in all of us. Actually, there is about a third of one. At the heart of this overproduced jumble you can still hear the faint beat of the simple story Lucas conceived about 15 years ago while researching Star Wars. Willow, played with beguiling wit by 3’4″, 18-year-old English actor Warwick (Return of the Jedi) Davis, lives in a community of Nelwyns—a peace-loving race of little people. One day Willow, his wife and two children take in a baby girl they find in a basket floating in the rushes near their farm. Director Howard cuts to the baby’s face whenever possible to elicit audience oohs and aahs. But Willow is worried. The infant is a Daikini, a warmongering race of big people whose land surrounds the Nelwyns. Not just any Daikini, mind you. She is a female Moses, destined to grow up and set her people free from the evil Queen Bavmorda, played by Jean Marsh like a live-action version of the bad apple in Snow White. To Willow falls the task of speeding the child to safety after overcoming such obstacles as the queen’s army, assorted trolls, a deadly snow slide and a two-headed, people-eating dragon.
  Lucas’ story is a shrewd and shameless steal from the Bible, Walt Disney, his own Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz (let’s face it, Willow is a Munchkin). Young children might have played into Lucas’ hands if he hadn’t insisted on going over their heads. As executive producer with a royalty on all ancillary products (7 percent is the industry standard), Lucas wants everybody’s trade. He throws in a love story to pull in the teens. Val Kilmer, a pop idol since his performance as the Iceman in Top Gun, plays a rebel warrior who befriends Willow and tries to bed the queen’s feisty daughter, English actress Joanne Whalley. Though married in real life, Kilmer and Whalley offer only a pale version of the Han Solo-Princess Leia romance in the three Star Wars pictures.
  On the adult front, eyes are also glazing. Technical razzle-dazzle and gorgeous location photography in England, Wales and New Zealand are no substitute for characterization. Neither are Lucas’ frequent in-joke references. For example, the Darth Vaderish villain of the piece, General Kael (played by Pat Roach), shares the surname of The New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael, who has castigated Lucas for his “toy business” tendencies.
  Next comes a brazen bid for the senior-citizen contingent. The movie’s good witch, who keeps changing form (bird, muskrat, goat, ostrich, tiger), is finally revealed as an old lady (Patricia Hayes) who bravely takes on the bad queen in geriatric battle.

George Lucas dreamed up the ``Star Wars'' movies and the Indiana Jones adventures, but he still hasn't used up his enthusiasm for myth, fantasy, and adventure. His latest film is the epic called ``Willow,'' and following his usual custom in recent years, he enlisted another filmmaker to direct it: Ron Howard, whose own fantasy credits include ``Splash'' and ``Cocoon.'' ``Willow'' begins with a dark and gloomy scene about a slaughter of the innocents. An evil queen is afraid of a rival who, according to a prediction, will someday take away her power. So she orders all the female babies in her land to be seized and done away with. The future good queen has been born, although she's still a baby, and she escapes the bad queen's trap. But she lands in a place outside her own kingdom, in a land occupied by charming little people who don't know anything about this nasty business. These nice folks mount an expedition to take the baby home. Along the way they meet good people and bad people - some bigger, some far littler than they are - and have more adventures than you could shake a magic wand at. Many characters in ``Willow'' are played by little people, and they're mostly terrific actors. As the title character, Warwick Davis is incredibly lovable, with a friendly smile that has you on his side from the start. Another feisty performance comes from Billy Barty, as an amusing wizard whose fortune-telling charms don't reveal anything at all. Among the big people, Jean Marsh - of ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' fame - is wonderfully menacing as the queen. You can't help enjoying a movie like ``Willow'' at least a little. It has a fairy-tale story, likable performers, a zillion special effects, and a fresh, optimistic feeling that lets you know everything will come out OK in the end. I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to, though. It took a while before I could figure out what the missing ingredient was. I tried to get in the swing of things, like the many children in the audience, who were obviously having a great time. But sometime during the second hour I pinpointed the trouble: The movie is so full of tricks and gimmicks that it doesn't care enough about being just plain funny. I don't mean it has no laughs, or at least chuckles, once it gets past the first scene. If you saw ``Splash'' or ``Cocoon,'' you know Ron Howard has a sense of humor, and if you saw ``Star Wars'' or ``American Graffiti,'' you know George Lucas has a sense of humor. Neither of them has gone sour on us. But in ``Willow'' they keep straining to be fey and magical and cute. ``Willow'' is a good-hearted movie, and I'm glad there always seems to be a new generation of filmmakers to recycle the old Hollywood myths for a new generation of moviegoers. Children old enough to handle a PG rating will have a ball with this picture. But I wish Messrs. Howard and Lucas didn't work so hard at being legendary, and handed us a little more effortless fun. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations."
"Dec 6, 2018",NEGATIVE,Predictable and highly derivative.
"Dec 5, 2018",POSITIVE,"Time-worn myths and legends get a zestful, entertaining reworking in Willow."

"May 28, 2018",NEUTRAL,"A charming, albeit greatly compromised attempt at doing a monumental epic in just two hours... the most handsome and technologically accomplished film of the '80s fantasy cycle."
"Jan 3, 2018",POSITIVE," Ron Howard's directorial debut, Grand Theft Auto follows young lovers Sam (Howard) and Paula (Nancy Morgan) as they decide to elope after her parents demand that she marry a wealthy scion (Paul Linke's Collins Hedgeworth) - with the couple's decision to steal her father's Rolls Royce triggering a cross-country chase as they're subsequently pursued by dozens of oddball characters (including Rance Howard's Ned and Clint Howard's Ace). It's a thin premise that's employed to watchable yet far-from-engrossing effect by Howard, as the first-time filmmaker's ongoing emphasis on pursuit sequences inevitably lends the proceedings a decidedly monotonous quality - with the novelty of the over-the-top chases wearing off in as demonstrable and firm a manner as one might've feared. There's little doubt that Grand Theft Auto's affable atmosphere is, as a result, due primarily to the efforts of the film's stars, with Howard's effortlessly charismatic performance ensuring that the viewer can't help but root for Sam and Paula's success. (The palpable chemistry between Howard and Morgan certainly plays an instrumental role in perpetuating this feel.) By the time the frenetic and excessive demolition derby finale rolls around, however, Grand Theft Auto has cemented its place as a passable debut that runs out of steam long before it reaches its crowd-pleasing conclusion. An early, made-for-television  effort from Ron Howard, Ron Howard's Skyward follows wheelchair-bound high-schooler Julie Ward (Suzy Gilstrap) as she discovers a passion for flying after a surreptitious trip to a nearby airfield. It's subsequently not long before Julie is receiving airborne lessons from a local flight instructor named Billie Dupree (Bette Davis), with the narrative also detailing Julie's growing friendship with an affable fellow student (Ben Marley's Scott Billings) and said airfield's affable mechanic (Howard Hesseman's Koup Trenton). The early part of Ron Howard's Skyward, though, details the various indignities experienced by Gilstrap's character, as Julie is, for example, embarrassed by her new teacher and unable to use the non-accessible girl's bathroom. It's fairly tedious stuff that's compounded by a lack of narrative momentum and an almost aggressively deliberate pace, with, in terms of the latter, the movie's slowness ultimately preventing the viewer from working up any interest in (or enthusiasm for) the protagonist's feel-good antics. The eye-rolling predictability of  Nancy Sackett's screenplay exacerbates the movie's less-than-watchable atmosphere, as there's virtually nothing that occurs within Ron Howard's Skyward that one doesn't see coming from miles away (eg Julie's parents forbid her from flying, Julie fights with Scott, etc, etc) - which ultimately prevents the  finale from packing the uplifting, emotional punch that Howard is obviously striving for. Ron Howard's first bona fide hit, Night Shift follows morgue attendant Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) as he's convinced to start operating a brothel out of his workplace by flashy new coworker Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) - with complications ensue as the mild-mannered Chuck finds himself falling for one of his prostitutes (Shelley Long's Belinda Keaton). It's a unique premise that's employed to affable (if entirely forgettable) effect by director Howard, as the filmmaker, working from a script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, does an effective job of initially establishing the movie's seedy, New York City-landscape and assortment of oddball characters. It's clear early on that Night Shift benefits heavily from Keaton's star-making turn as the excitable, impetuous Blazejowski, and it's ultimately impossible to deny that the movie suffers during stretches when Keaton's character is offscreen (which occurs more and more as the movie approaches its inevitable conclusion). There is, as such, little doubt that the film takes a serious dive in its increasingly underwhelming third act, with Ganz and Mandel's script emphasizing elements that couldn't possibly be less interesting - including Chuck's decision to break away from both Long and Keaton's respective characters (ie it's a twist on the dreaded fake break-up cliche). Night Shift's obvious overlength ultimately prevents it from becoming the briskly-paced, easygoing comedy that Howard is clearly striving for, which is a shame, really, given that the movie is actually quite engaging and entertaining in its   breezy first half - with the  three stars, Keaton especially, heightening the decidedly affable atmosphere with impressive ease. Splash is probably the ultimate fish-out-of-water film, primarily because it literally features a fish out of water. With engaging performances from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah, the movie, which follows a workaholic (Hanks' Allen Bauer) as he falls for an honest-to-goodness mermaid (Hannah's Madison), is an agreeable  romantic comedy that's deservedly become a minor classic of the genre. Splash marked Hanks' first attempt at a romantic leading man, and there's no denying that even at this early stage in his career he's got screen presence to spare. Likewise, Hannah brings a real innocence to this role; the script requires the actress to approach common items with wide-eyed wonder, and Hannah does a nice job of holding her own opposite Hanks. Director Ron Howard brings his usual light touch to the proceedings and manages to hold the viewer's interest even through the narrative's oddly action-packed final third (ie once the truth about Hannah's character is revealed, the film becomes more of a thriller than a cute little romantic comedy and there's even a chase sequence as the army attempts to capture the mermaid/woman). Such elements appear to have been included to force Hanks' Allen into choosing a life above or below sea level, but it's a decision that could've been made without the unnecessary action stuff - and, in the process, the film likely would've clocked in at a much more reasonable 90 minutes (as it is, Splash runs close to two hours). Still, for most of its running time, Splash is awfully entertaining and features a wonderful early performance from Hanks - with the film's romcom elements, including an appropriately uplifting finale, ensuring that the whole thing ends on an exceedingly positive note. Based on a story by George Lucas, Willow follows Warwick Davis' title character as he reluctantly agrees to help protect a baby from an evil ruler (Jean Marsh's Queen Bavmorda) - with Willow eventually receiving assistance in the form of a charming scoundrel named Madmartigan (Val Kilmer). Director Ron Howard delivers an admittedly appealing opening stretch that effectively establishes Willow's fantastical world and raft of quirky characters, with, in terms of the latter, the movie certainly benefiting from Davis and Kilmer's thoroughly charming and affable work as the disparate protagonists (and it doesn't hurt, either, that the chemistry between the two couldn't be more solid). The episodic bent of Bob Dolman's screenplay does pave the way for a somewhat hit-and-miss midsection, however, although the inclusion of several impressively exciting sequences generally compensates for the erratic vibe. (There is, for example, a thoroughly thrilling horse-and-buggy chase that feels as though it's been pulled directly from the Indiana Jones series.) It's disappointing to note, then, that Willow, which runs a palpably overlong 126 minutes, suffers from a frenetic climax that's more exhausting  than anything else, and the film, as a result, palpably peters out long before it reaches its predictably upbeat conclusion - which finally does confirm Willow's place as a decent fantasy epic that never quite lives up to the promise of its engaging first act. Backdraft follows newly-minted firefighter Brian McCaffrey as he attempts to prove himself to his older brother (and experienced fireman) Stephen (Kurt Russell), with the movie eventually detailing the protagonists' efforts at identifying and stopping a deadly arsonist with an apparent grudge against the city. It's ultimately clear that Backdraft, which runs a hopelessly overlong 137 minutes, comes off as a top-notch thriller trapped within a poorly-paced and needlessly bloated piece of work, which is a shame, certainly, given that director Ron Howard has packed the proceedings with a number of above-average elements - including impressively staged-and-conceived fire sequences and a raft of better-than-average supporting performances. (The movie, in terms of the latter, boasts strong work by, among others, Robert De Niro, Scott Glenn, and Donald Sutherland, with the latter especially riveting as an aging pyromaniac.) The episodic bent of the film's first half - much of the narrative seems to follow the central characters as they fight one fire after another - does test the viewer's patience to a fairly demonstrable degree, and it's clear that Backdraft, by and large, works best when focused on the rivalry and relationship between the central figures (and how it ultimately affects their respective work). By the time the somewhat protracted climax rolls around, Backdraft has firmly confirmed its place as a mild disappointment from an otherwise consistent filmmaker.  Directed by Ron Howard, The Paper follows tabloid editor Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) as he's faced with a variety of personal and professional problems over the course of one very long, very eventful day. It's clear right away that The Paper benefits substantially from Keaton's typically stellar turn as the central character, with the actor's charismatic performance perpetuating (and heightening) the film's compulsively watchable atmosphere on a continuing basis. (There's little doubt, too, that the stellar supporting cast, which includes Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Randy Quaid, plays a pivotal role in confirming the film's success.) Filmmaker Howard employs a brisk pace that's certainly an ideal match for David and Stephen Koepp's lightning-quick screenplay, and it's worth noting, as well, that the scripters have infused the narrative with an authenticity that generally proves impossible to resist. (The film's staff-meeting sequences are an especially apt example of this, as such moments boast a lived-in, fly-on-the-wall feel that's nothing short of mesmerizing.) The Paper remains completely engrossing right up until its final half hour, with the climax perhaps just a little too frenetic and overblown for its own good (ie there's just too much happening here) - which ultimately cements the movie's place as a very entertaining, unapologetically ludicrous, and somewhat overlong effort from filmmaker Howard. A seriously stellar thriller, Ransom follows Mel Gibson's Tom Mullen as he and his wife (Rene Russo's Kate) attempt to negotiate the return of their son (Brawley Nolte's Sean) after he's kidnapped - with the story also detailing the exploits of the abductors and the dedicated cop (Delroy Lindo's Lonnie Hawkins) working the case. Filmmaker Ron Howard delivers a deliberately-paced yet often engrossing narrative that's rife with   electrifying sequences (eg the now-iconic ""give me back my son!"" scene, etc), and there's little doubt that the movie benefits substantially from its roster of above-average performances - with Gibson's ferocious and emotional turn mirrored by a strong supporting cast that includes Gary Sinise, Donnie Wahlberg, and Lili Taylor. Howard, working from a script by Richard Price and Alexander Ignon, does a superb job of slowly-but-surely tightening the screws as the storyline unfolds, with the inherent intensity of the premise paving the way for a midsection that's as gripping as one might've hoped. It's clear, too, that a strong twist at around the halfway mark effectively upends expectations and provides a palpable jolt of energy, and although the movie does begin to partially drag in its second half (ie this is not a story that needs to be told in 121 minutes), Ransom rebounds for an impressively captivating (and action-packed) finale that ensures it ends on as positive a note as one could envision - which certainly does confirm the film's place as one of Ron Howard's very best efforts (if not the best, really). Ed tv casts Matthew McConaughey as Ed Pekurny, an affable everyman whose life changes dramatically after he's cast as the star of a 24 hour television program documenting his every move - with Ed's newfound notoriety increasing substantially after he begins dating his brother's girlfriend (Jenna Elfman's Shari). It's a fine premise that's utilized to progressively underwhelming effect by filmmaker Ron Howard, as the movie, scripted by Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, grows more and more hackneyed and predictable as it progresses - with the emphasis shifting from Ed's experiences on the title television show to a series of almost eye-rollingly heavy-handed incidents (eg an evil executive attempts to blackmail Ed into fulfilling his contract). Before it gets to that point, however, Ed tv comes off as a fairly affable comedy that benefits substantially from McConaughey's charismatic turn as the central character - with the actor's strong work heightened by an impressive roster of supporting players (including Woody Harrelson, Martin Landau, and Dennis Hopper). The movie also boasts an appealing romance between McConaughey and Elfman's respective characters, although even this aspect of the proceedings ultimately wears out its welcome (ie the pair's relationship has been saddled with all the anticipated romcom beats and developments). It's finally impossible to label Ed tv as anything more than a sporadically effective yet predominantly misguided satire, with the movie, for the most part, paling in comparison to the similarly-themed Truman Show. The Missing marks a definite return to form for Ron Howard, whose last two films - the overwhelming How the Grinch Stole Christmas and the sappy A Beautiful Mind - felt more like products geared towards a large audience than anything else. They weren't necessarily bad movies, but they were certainly lacking in both the energy (ie Backdraft) or compelling characters (ie Parenthood) that have come to identify Howard pictures. The film stars Cate Blanchett as Maggie Gilkeson, a fiercely independent frontier woman living with her two daughters and boyfriend. Her estranged father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones), arrives on her doorstep, hoping to make amends. After being promptly dismissed, Jones heads on his way - but when Maggie's daughter is kidnapped by a band of rogue Indians, she's forced to ask her long-absent father for help in finding her. Though Howard has worked in the thriller genre before (1996's Ransom), he's never before made a film that's felt this gritty and urgent. There's a definite sense of danger permeating almost every minute of The Missing, a feeling that's supported by Blanchett's fantastic lead performance. Though Maggie is easily the most rugged character she's ever tackled, Blanchett is entirely believable as this tough woman that's willing to do whatever it takes to get her daughter back. As was the case with Ransom, Howard has taken an actor known primarily for middle-of-the-road characterizations and managed to elicit a performance with undertones of ferociousness. That same kind of raw energy can also be felt in the film's visual look, as cinematographer Salvatore Totino brings an uneasy quality to the wide open spaces of the old west. There's a feeling of authenticity going on here; we're never under the impression that certain scenes have been shot on a sound stage somewhere. Howard does a nice job of turning the landscape into a supporting character, rather than just another threat to Maggie's mission. Though there are a lot of effective elements to be found within The Missing, the film is substantially overlong; at a running time of over two hours, the movie could've used some judicious editing. The sequences dealing with the Indian magic spells and potions proves to be the most superfluous aspect of the story and indeed often border on outright silliness. (There is, for example, a silly sequence revolving around in Indian exorcism that stops the movie dead in its tracks.) But even such instances of absurd spirituality can't mar the fact that The Missing is an exemplary thriller. It's been designed in such a way as to appeal to folks that ordinarily aren't a fan of this genre, since the relationship between Maggie and her father receives ample screentime. Though it's not quite a great Ron Howard film (somewhere along the lines of Apollo 13), it's certainly a darn good one. Though Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code will never be mistaken for high art, the novel was, at the very least, consistently interesting and generally entertaining. And while this adaptation - written by Akiva Goldsman - contains many of the same beats and plot twists as Brown's book, the film never quite becomes anything more than a sporadically engaging but mostly dull murder mystery. Tom Hanks stars as Robert Langdon, a top symbologist who is unwittingly recruited by a grizzled French cop (Jean Reno) to assist in the mysterious death of one of the Louvre's top curators. Along with said curators daughter, Sophie (Audrey Tautou), Robert soon finds himself caught up in a far-reaching conspiracy revolving around a religious coverup of epic proportions. The Da Vinci Code's been directed by Ron Howard, who imbues the movie with an almost maddeningly somber vibe - refusing to allow even a hint of levity to enter the proceedings, despite the fact that Brown's novel was actually rife with humorous asides and genuinely exciting action sequences. Howard - collaborating once again with Cinderella Man cinematographer Salvatore Totino - apes the austere look and feel of that Russell Crowe drama, which immediately proves to be an incongruous match with the source material (the movie sure looks nice, however). The film is, consequently, not nearly as engrossing as one might've expected, and primarily moves at a pace that can most accurately be referred to as deliberate. And although Howard and Goldsman waste absolutely no time in thrusting the viewer into the action, the almost complete lack of character development makes it virtually impossible to actually care about Robert and Sophie's quest. That Hanks delivers an atypically charmless performance doesn't help matters; while the actor certainly isn't bad in the role, he transforms Robert Langdon into a figure that's overly grave and far from engaging. Likewise, Tautou quickly proves to be the absolute wrong choice for the role of Sophie - as the actress is simply unable to convincingly infuse the character with an appropriate mix of confidence and seriousness (her ridiculously thick French accent doesn't do her any favors, either). The only performance that really works here is Paul Bettany's turn as Silas, the killer albino monk hot on Robert and Sophie's trail. Though he's not given a whole lot of screen time, Bettany dominates the proceedings and easily remains the most intriguing and effective aspect of the movie. In terms of the book's supposed ""controversial"" content, Goldsman has left most of it intact - although he does play it safe by turning Robert into something of a skeptic (an element that certainly wasn't contained within Brown's novel). And ultimately, it's that sort of refusal to take risks - combined with a distinct sense of blandness - that sinks The Da Vinci Code. As slick as one might've expected, Frost/Nixon tells the true-life story of how British talk-show host David Frost (Michael Sheen) managed to land a series of interviews with disgrace ex-President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella). The film, based on Peter Morgan's award-winning play, primarily details the build-up into the interviews among both sides, as Frost prepares by collaborating with a ragtag group of intellectuals (including Sam Rockwell's James Reston Jr and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick) and Nixon conspires with trusted aide Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon) to turn the hyped conversations to their advantage. Although filmmaker Ron Howard generally does a superb job of satisfying both mainstream viewers and history buffs, there's ultimately little doubt that Frost/Nixon will have a more pronounced impact on the latter - as the movie suffers from a dramatically-inert midsection that often seems consumed with the minutia of Frost and Nixon's preparations. It's subsequently not surprising to note that the film suffers from an undeniable lack of tension as it builds towards the pair's series of encounters, with Howard's lighthearted approach effectively lending the proceedings an air of frivolity that often borders on cute. The entertaining-yet-middling atmosphere eventually does give way to an electrifying and downright moving third act, however, as the title pair's confrontations are fraught with a back-and-forth dynamic that inevitably proves irresistible. Langella and Sheen's stirring work certainly goes a long way towards cementing Frost/Nixon's mild success, while Howard surely deserves credit for infusing the production with a distinctly cinematic quality that generally belies its stage origins.  Though undoubtedly a minor improvement over its underwhelming predecessor, 2006's The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons is nevertheless unable to replicate the propulsive, downright enthralling sensibilities of Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon adventure. And while it'd be easy to pin the blame for the movie's ineffectiveness on the almost unreasonable amount of changes made to Brown's novel, it's ultimately clear that Ron Howard's egregiously solemn directorial choices remain the most obvious deficiency within this ongoing series - as the filmmaker is either unable or unwilling to infuse the proceedings with the fun, fast-paced atmosphere demanded by the source material. The movie follows Tom Hanks' intrepid symbologist as he races to prevent the fabled Illuminati from executing four Cardinals and blowing up the Vatican, with his efforts aided by a fiery physicist (Ayelet Zurer's Vittoria Vetra) and a helpful papal official (Ewan McGregor's Patrick McKenna). It's an unapologetically over-the-top premise that, although employed to exceedingly entertaining effect within the book, inevitably results in a middling cinematic endeavor, as Howard - working from a script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman - emphasizes a consistent tone of reverence that proves an incongruous match with the comparatively light-hearted nature of Brown's eponymous bestseller. The relentless stream of exposition that dominates Angels & Demons' opening half hour certainly contributes heavily to the stagnant vibe, with the baffling absence of several of the novel's most exciting sequences - ie Langdon's battle with an unnamed assassin within Rome's famed Fountain of the Four Rivers, Langdon's perilous efforts at rescuing Vittoria from the clutches of said assassin, etc, etc - undoubtedly exacerbating the pacing problems that persist virtually from start to finish. And although supporting players Zurer and McGregor ably step into their respective roles, Hanks' atypically charmless work as the central character remains an emblematic example of everything that's wrong with this series (ie the movie's resemblance to an Oscar-time prestige picture goes against the intent of Brown's books). The exhilarating third act does ensure that Angels & Demons ends on a positive note, admittedly, yet it remains abundantly clear that the film simply isn't as pervasively engrossing as one might've hoped. True to its title, The Dilemma follows Ronny Valentine (Vince Vaughn) as he struggles to tell his best friend Nick (Kevin James) that his wife (Winona Ryder's Geneva) is cheating on him - with problems ensuing as Ronny's increasingly convoluted web of lies begins to threaten his relationship with Jennifer Connelly's Beth. There's little doubt that The Dilemma fares best in its opening half hour, as filmmaker Ron Howard, working from Allan Loeb's screenplay, does a nice job of initially establishing the various characters and their relationships with one another - which effectively ensures that the movie's leisurely pace is, at the outset, not as problematic as one might've feared. It's only as the film progresses into its increasingly uneven midsection that one's interest begins to wane, with the almost excessive familiarity of the storyline resulting in plot twists of a decidedly predictable variety (eg Connelly's character begins to suspect that gambling addict Ronny is up to his old tricks). Howard's curiously deliberate sensibilities inevitably wreak havoc on The Dilemma's momentum, as the director's difficulties in sustaining a consistent tone ultimately ensure that the movie works neither as a comedy nor as a drama (eg it's not funny enough for the former or emotional enough for the latter). The inclusion of a few admittedly energetic interludes - eg Ronny confronts Geneva's tattooed, high-on-oxycontin boyfriend (Channing Tatum's Zip) - goes a long way towards sustaining the film's watchable atmosphere, yet it's hard to deny that the whole thing is, in the final analysis, far too sedate and uneven to make a wholeheartedly positive impact on the viewer. Inspired by true events, Rush details the rivalry between '70s Formula One drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) - with the film exploring the characters' exploits in both their professional and personal lives. Though the movie doesn't exactly open with a lot of promise - Hemsworth's character is, for example, first glimpsed seducing a nurse à la James Bond - Rush eventually settles to become a consistently engrossing drama that boasts a handful of genuinely exciting racing sequences (although, by that same token, it's hard not to wish that filmmaker Ron Howard had spent a little more time on the individual races). It's worth noting, too, that Rush fares quite well in its smaller, more low-key moments, with the movie's transformation from merely passable to thoroughly watchable triggered by an early interlude in which Lauda first encounters his future wife (Alexandra Maria Lara's Marlene). There's similarly little doubt that the film benefits substantially from the above-average efforts of its various stars, with Hemsworth and Brühl's stand-out work complemented by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Stephen Mangan, Christian McKay, and Olivia Wilde. And although the movie suffers from a rather anticlimactic final stretch - the narrative peaks with a fantastic crash sequence that leaves one of the protagonists badly injured - Rush ultimately stands as a satisfying biopic that gets the job done efficiently and without much fanfare (ie Howard clearly isn't looking to reinvent the wheel here, so to speak). Ron Howard's third (and weakest) stab at a Dan Brown adaptation, Inferno follows Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon as he and an emergency-room doctor (Felicity Jones' Sienna Brooks) team up to prevent a catastrophic global plot designed to wipe out more than half of the world's population. It's instantly clear that Howard, along with returning screenwriter David Koepp, has learned nothing from the relative failure of both The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as Inferno, for the most part, chugs along at a lackadaisical pace that's compounded by an overlong running time and surfeit of underwhelming subplots. (There is, in terms of the latter, a terminally tedious  storyline involving Omar Sy's tenacious pursuing cop, Christoph.) The spinning-its-wheels atmosphere persists for much of Inferno's midsection, which seems to consist entirely of sequences wherein Hanks and Jones' respective characters attempt to figure out a clue and run from bad guys. It's a formula that's repeated over and over and grows increasingly tiresome as time slowly progresses, with the movie's less-than-engrossing vibe compounded by a lack of compelling action sequences. (The only real exception to this comes near the beginning, as Howard offers up an  exciting hospital escape/street pursuit that ultimately stands as a high point.) Hanks' solid yet stiff performance is, in the end, emblematic of everything that's wrong with Inferno, as the film's overly serious feel is completely at odds with the fun, fast-paced tone of Brown's page-turner - with, especially, the dull third act ensuring that the movie ends on as anti-climactic a note as one could envision. Set years before the events of A New Hope, Solo: A Star Wars Story follows a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) as he  embarks upon a potentially lucrative quest alongside, among others, Woody Harrelson's Beckett and Emilia Clarke's Qi'ra - with the narrative also detailing Solo's initial encounters with future compatriots Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Filmmaker Ron Howard delivers a narrative that doesn't, at the outset, hold a lot of promise, as Solo: A Star Wars Story kicks off with about as uninvolving and unexciting an opening as one could possibly imagine - with Howard, working from a script by Jonathan and Lawrence Kasdan, drops the viewer into a disastrously underwhelming action sequence that's compounded by Bradford Young's dimly-lit, often incoherent cinematography. And while the movie subsequently never quite becomes the engrossing blockbuster one might've expected, Solo: A Star Wars Story, at least, eventually manages to morph into a decent, mostly watchable adventure flick that's elevated by a series of strong supporting performances - with, especially, Glover's ridiculously charismatic turn as the original trilogy's  fan-favorite figure standing as a highlight. (Ehrenreich is fine here, though he's never entirely convincing as a younger version of Harrison Ford's iconic title character.) The ongoing inclusion of admittedly engaging set-pieces (eg Han and his cohorts pull off an elaborate heist) ensures that one's interest never entirely flags, and although the film never entirely adds up to anything terribly memorable or distinctive, Solo: A Star Wars Story is nevertheless a decent origin narrative that answers a handful of legitimate questions from George Lucas' saga (and even firmly ends the did-Han-or-Greedo-shoot-first debate)."
"Aug 23, 2016",POSITIVE," 'Willow,' directed by Ron Howard and based on a story by George Lucas, is quite literally a fantastic film, for it is all about fantasy - and the very real world of emotional courage. It doesn't take long before you realize there will be no let-up in this movie: the action is non-stop, the special effectsand scenery are dazzling, the story line, though simple, has every roadblock imaginable thrown up before the conclusion. It is glorious, this excess, just like a child's fantasy, something no one should grow too old to appreciate. Yet at the heart of 'Willow' there is pure love -- gushing, romantic, true-blue love. It's your basic good vs. evil story line. Guess who wins. Willow Ufgood, the film's central character, played by Warwick Davis, lives with his Nelwyn neighbors in a quiet village in an area surrounded by the war waged by the big people, the Daikinis. The fates call upon Willow and an outcast Daikini warrior Madmartigan, played by Val Kilmer, to do battle with the forces of evil to make sure a special Daikini baby fulfills her destiny to bring down the wicked Queen Bavmorda, played by Jean Marsh. The pair and their small ward -- who manages to mug the camera about the best any 6-month-old has ever done - are accompanied on their journey by a good sorceress, played by Patricia Hayes, and the daughter of Queen Bavmorda, Sorsha, played by Joanne Whalley. (Whalley and Kilmer end up lovers in the film, and in real life as well; they got married in March.) Special commendations go to the production designer, Allan Cameron, and prosthetic make-up designer Nick Dudman, who helped create such a fantastic fantasy-world. And to the mountains, lakes and hills of North Wales, and the spectacular glacial areas of New Zealand that serve as the backdrop for 'Willow.' The world may not need yet another swashbuckling epic adventure, but one with so much heart and soul and fantasy surely is a welcome addition."

	""Willow"" is medieval mishmash from George Lucas, a sort of 10th-century ""Star Wars"" tossed together with a plethora of elements taken from numerous classic fables. Even if Lucas has bastardized his own story with derivative and unoriginal elements, kids probably will love it. For MGM Pictures, b.o. should mean recoupment of its large investment. “Willow” is medieval mishmash from George Lucas, a sort of 10th-century “Star Wars” tossed together with a plethora of elements taken from numerous classic fables.  Even if Lucas has bastardized his own story with derivative and unoriginal elements, kids probably will love it. For MGM Pictures, b.o. should mean recoupment of its large investment. Most of the characters have unpronounceable names, an attempt to disguise from whence they come: Han Solo, R2 D2 and C-3PO, Princess Leia and Darth Vader from “Star Wars,” Bilbo Baggins from “The Hobbit,” the lilliputians from “Gulliver’s Travels,” Glinda, the Good Witch of the North from “The Wizard of Oz” and even Moses from the Old Testament, to name a few. They serve to clutter a simple story, saving their kingdom from an evil queen (Jean Marsh) who makes her crusade to kill every newborn in the land to ensure that baby Elora Danan, a princess, never ascends to her throne.  The most engaging thing about “Willow” is the baby, played by twins Ruth and Kate Greenfield, whom filmmakers must have spent many hours photographing to get the amazingly varied expressions that sync so beautifully with the storyline. The baby is floated downriver by a sympathetic midwife fearing she will be killed (read: Moses) and ends up on the banks of the Nelwyn’s peachful settlement where Willow (Warwick Davis) is commanded by the Nelwyn’s leader, High Aldwin (Billy Barty) to return her to her people, the Daikinis. Davis is terrified of his mission for Daikinis are in the midst of a war with the forces controlled by the sinister and all-powerful sorceress Queen Bavmorda–Marsh, made up as the spitting image of the evil queen in Disney’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Not since the munchkins came out to sing for Dorothy have there been so many midgets on screen (except perhaps in “Under the Rainbow“), here depicted whooping it up like they were at a Renaissance Faire. Willow gets a loving send-off, baby on his back papoose-style, and sets off for what surely should be an adventure  but turns out more a series of haphazard encounters with mostly nonthreatening creatures on a journey through some fantastic matte paintings done up to look like The Middle Kingdom. Along the way, he teams up with a wisecracking Han Solo renegade warrior named Madmartigan (read: Mad Max), played well enough by Val Kilmer, and the two of them–cute baby giving the appropriate silent commentary the whole time–manage to avert real danger that the Queen is plotting back at her castle. Good versus evil is much more watered down in “Willow” than any of the “Star Wars” chapters, due in large part to so many different distractions constantly coming at the protagonists. Darth Vader shows up as a shadow of his former self, an evil warrior named General Kael (Pat Roach) made up with a skeleton mask. If there isn’t a couple of jokester little people nipping at their heels, Willow and Madmartigan are talking to ghostly friendly spirits and animatronic rodents, and fighting an “Alien”-looking 2-headed monster, warthogs and trolls that look like apes. Dialog waivers from the truly banal – Willow himself is very earnest and boring – to some very clever interplay between the secondary characters, including a delightful scene between Madmartigan, dusted with love sparkles, and the object of his desire, Sorsha (real-life wife, Joanne Whalley), the evil queen’s daughter. Ron Howard directed, but only Lucasness shows up on the screen, particularly towards the end when the special effects start to come on at full bore.  Much of it has been seen before in Lucas productions, notably the ending where Marsh and a good sorceress claw at each other while the baby is squirming on a sacrificial altar about to be obliterated by a supernatural force a la “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” Inventiveness shows up in the transformations of humans into pigs, a particularly funny scene, and in the metamorphosis of a possum sorceress into a crow, a goat, an ostrich and finally an old lady. Sword-brandishing scenes are, for the most part, a muddled mess as the camera rarely pulls back far enough to give the feel of battle. Exceptions are the aerial shots down on Madmartigan and Willow slashing away at an incredibly fake-looking, 2-headed sci-fi monster–technically something of an achievement, but way out of place with the magical sorcery theme of the overall film. The scenery, that which isn’t matte paintings, is stunning. “Willow” was lensed in England, Wales and New Zealand. It’s not surprising the overall flavor of the production looks familiar. Production designer Allan Cameron (“Aliens”) and cinematographer Adrian Biddle (“Aliens,” “The Princess Bride”) have put their stamp on the film. Industrial Light & Magic wizards, too numerous to mention, are up to usual Lucasfilm standards of excellence."

Producer George Lucas and director Ron Howard’s hokey 1988 Tolkien knock-off may pale in the wake of Peter Jackson’s monumental trilogy, but there’s still plenty to enjoy. Built on fantasy stereotypes – friendly little folk, evil witches, misunderstood heroes, guys on horseback with bloody great swords – it nonetheless contains enough epic action, narrative momentum and spit-and-sawdust pre-CGI special effects to hold the attention.Revisiting the film, a few things stand out. Val Kilmer’s performance as the wisecracking Madmartigan (great name) feels like a true star turn, packed with breezy charisma, in contrast to the more ‘difficult’ persona he now inhabits. The backdrops are a triumph of the matte painter’s art – recognisably fake at times, but beautiful nonetheless. And all of this is undercut by a mile-wide streak of slushy, gushy sentiment – a tendency which mainstream action cinema has mercifully abandoned in the years since.

"May 20, 2003",NEGATIVE," Today's films have a way of being supplanted overnight. However bright or ground breaking it may be, a new film can be followed in a flash by another that copies and comments on the first, and this process can repeat and repeat itself. So five or six stages of fantasy film making separate the 1977 ''Star Wars'' from the new ''Willow,'' although George Lucas made his plans for both projects at roughly the same time. Even if the two sets of raw material had been of equal worth, ''Willow'' would inevitably lie under the long ''Star Wars'' shadow. The startling thing about ''Star Wars,'' after all, was its mixture of hip, knowing style and perfect innocence. Though every imaginable adventure-movie flourish found its way into Mr. Lucas's amalgam, ''Star Wars'' could simultaneously wink and marvel at the cinematic past. But as ''Willow'' now strives for a similar effect, even ''Star Wars'' has become fodder. So without anything like the earlier film's eager, enthusiastic tone, and indeed with an understandable weariness, ''Willow'' recapitulates images from ''Snow White,'' ''The Wizard of Oz,'' ''Gulliver's Travels,'' ''Mad Max,'' ''Peter Pan,'' ''Star Wars'' itself, the Hobbit saga, Japanese monster films of the 1950's, the Bible and a million fairy tales. One tiny figure combines the best attributes of Tinkerbell, the Good Witch Glinda and the White Rock Girl. As this may suggest, ''Willow'' is as vast as it is secondhand. Its scale is an advantage at a time when most other films seem unreasonably small; so is its easygoing sense of humor. And the attempt to stage another huge, ambitious fantasy has a certain nobility even when the film itself does not, so that ''Willow'' at least creates the sense that its audience is witnessing a legitimate cinematic event. For all but the most hardened fantasy fans, though, the effect will be less than all-enveloping. There is simply too much water over the dam since this idea took flight, and too little new under the sun. And ''Willow,'' which opens today in New York, doesn't have the perfect pitch of ''Star Wars''; much of the time, it seems slightly askew. The title, for instance, suggests a beautiful, lissome heroine or perhaps a cherished tree, but it is in fact the name of a 3-foot 4-inch character (played by Warwick Davis) who doesn't even succeed in holding center stage. Willow is part of a tribe of neo-Munchkins called Nelwyns, and the film nominally centers on a mission that comes his way. A baby named Elora Danan (Kate and Ruth Greenfield) has been cast upon the waters after the evil Queen Bavmorda (Jean Marsh) hears the prophesy that this child will cause her downfall; then Willow finds the little girl and assumes the role of her protector. Bible scholars may well question the need for such novelty. In any case, after its violent beginning, the film spends an enjoyable sojourn with several hundred Nelwyns, who live in igloo-like structures, are dwarfed by their own farm animals and rely on the teachings of a sorcerer named High Aldwin (Billy Barty, who's funny in this role). When the sorcerer tells Willow to follow his heart, he becomes the Obi-Wan Kenobi of a film that also has its Darth Vader, R2-D2, C-3P0 and Princess Leia stand-ins. Much energy has gone into the creation of their names, some of which (General Kael) have recognizable sources and others (Burglekutt, Cherlindrea, Airk) have only tongue-twisting in mind. Not even the names have anything like ''Star Wars''-level staying power. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Aug 12, 2002",POSITIVE," A pig as a plow animal and a two-headed, sharp-toothed monster worthy of your worst nightmare — these are the bestial extremes of good and bad as represented in Willow, a $35 million fantasy-adventure with much to recommend it. It’s the collaborative effort of director Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon) and executive producer George Lucas (the Star Wars trilogy) who know something about the genre. Within its bountiful two hours are swordplay, sorcery, romance, and sensational special effects bound to restore the filmgoer’s sense of wonder. No matter that the story, written by Lucas and turned into a screenplay by Bob Dolman, is as old as the Magna Carta. It’s how the filmmakers dress it up that counts. They set the action around the medieval period in a forested land with snowcapped peaks. Willow Lofgood, a small-sized farmer belonging to the Nelwyn race, rescues a baby girl in the river. She is a princess from the normal-sized Daikini race who is destined to save the world from the evil Queen Bavmorda. To that end, Willow leaves his wife and children to travel across treacherous countryside and return the princess to her people. Enabling Willow to complete his mission is Madmartigan, a Daikini swordsman of dubious moral purpose. But the sight of the cooing princess and the strong arm of circumstance persuade him to help against marauding soldiers and the mean queen’s minions. As these plucky adventurers march through the woods, Willow recalls a dozen other films. Just when deja vu threatens to turn to boredom, the technicians at Industrial Light and Magic, the super-duper special-effects facility, create the most wonderful images. Wit accounts for the Lilliputian cavemen who set an underground trap for Willow, purely to remind him of his destiny. Known as Brownies, two of these creatures become his traveling companions and provide a running comical patter. Some of the funniest moments are the simplest. Nothing’s more exciting than when Willow takes a bullet-fast toboggan ride on a soldier’s shield, swooping through eye-catching ice caverns. Acting isn’t usually the strong suit in pictures of this sort. Yet, the arresting presence and sincerity of 18-year-old Warwick Davis as Willow is the exception to the rule. The warm humanity of the early scenes, set in Willow’s village, has a sweetness that carries the film far. Able support is provided by Jean Marsh as the evil queen and Billy Barty as the leader of the Nelwyns. Val Kilmer lacks mythic stature as the rowdy hero Madmartigan. In his bluffing belligerence, he sounds like any one of several local radio talk-show hosts. In a misguided attempt at humor, some lines fall thuddingly flat. One Nelwyn warns another about touching the princess baby: “Don’t go near it, you don’t know where it’s been.” Another problem is more serious. Not only the film’s targeted audience of children will be shifting in their seats toward the end, despite a slam-bang finish at Queen Bavmorda’s castle with more fireworks than at the Statue of Liberty’s July Fourth celebration. It’s as if the filmmakers wanted to give people their money’s worth. In case they have sensitive kids, parents should be forewarned about the protracted mayhem during these scenes. Regardless of who’s in the audience, there is no need to show two women engaging in a slug-fest for dominion of the world. A similar scene of female fist-fighting was bad in The Turning Point and it’s worse in a fantasy-adventure, where the reality of hard blows should never seem so. Still, Willow is a mostly gentle-spirited film, full of peak moments, and for that it is easy to put aside what is wrong with it. Besides, director Howard keeps the focus of the journey ever in view with dozens of reaction shots by the red-haired baby princess."

"Jan 1, 2000",POSITIVE," “Willow” is a fearsomely ambitious movie, but it is not fearsome, and it is not wondrous, and it is about a journey too far down a road too well-traveled by other movies. It’s a fantasy about the quest of a lovable little person and his heroic newfound friend to return a lost baby to where she belongs and to outsmart a wicked queen and kill a two-headed dragon in the process. In other words, standard stuff. What was supposed to make “Willow” special was the quality of the production. This is a sword-and-sorcery epic produced by George Lucas, whose “Star Wars” portrayed the same kind of material in outer space, and directed by Ron Howard, whose human touch made “Cocoon” one of the best recent science-fiction movies. The special effects are by Lucas’s company, Industrial Light and Magic, which has set the standard in such matters. The budget was umpteen million dollars, and Hollywood has been hoping that the Force was definitely with this film. Alas, even the largest budgets and the most meticulous special effects are only dead weight unless they have a story to make them move. And at the story level, “Willow” is turgid and relentlessly predictable. Not much really happens, and when it does, its pace is slowed by special effects set pieces that run on too long and seem to be recycled out of earlier movies. The story: Willow, citizen of the Nelwyns, a race of little people, is chosen by his community to take a baby to a far-off crossroads where she can be found by her people, the Daikinis. The baby was carried to Willow’s land on a crude raft that was swept along by river waters, but what Willow does not know is that the baby was placed on the raft by her desperate mother. That was to save her from a decree of death dealt out to all girl children by Bavmorda, the vicious queen and sorcerer, who fears her successor has been born. So already we have the story of Moses, cross-pollinated with “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Lucas has a reputation as a student of old legends and folklore, but there is a thin line between that and simply being a student of old movies. One of the crucial problems in “Willow” is that we see so much of this baby. She is dragged from one end of the known world to the other, usually with a plucky smile on her face. And whenever something interesting happens, we get an appropriate reaction shot from the baby. Willow (Warwick Davis) sets off with the baby in arms, and at the crossroads he meets Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a warrior who has been imprisoned in a cage. Madmartigan convinces Willow to free him, using much too much dialogue in the process, and then they team up to continue their quest, which leads eventually to Bavmorda’s fortress, guarded by a two-headed, fire-breathing dragon. So, OK, the dragon is well done. All of the special effects are competent, but they do not breathe with the fire of life because they are not motivated by a strong story we really care about. The characters in “Willow” are shallow and unexciting, and the story is a plod through recycled legend. Therefore even the battle with the dragon is a foregone conclusion. There can be no true suspense in a movie where even the characters seem to be inspired by other movies. Its pacing is too deliberate, and it doesn’t have a light heart. That’s revealed in the handling of some characters named the Brownies, represented by a couple of men who are about 9 inches tall and fight all the time. Maybe Lucas thought these guys would work like R2-D2 and C-3PO did in “Star Wars.” But they have no depth, no personalities, no dimension; they’re simply an irritant at the edge of the frame. Touches like that will only confuse kids who know that good dreams do not have to be clever, or consistent, or expensive, but that they should never, ever, make you want to wake up.

                      it's actually a curiously beautiful film, filled with characters 
                      and a story that have never been attempted in any other 
                      movie. It's unique, down to the core.
 I 
                      absolutely loved this movie, from beginning to end. And, 
                      for some oddly strange reason, I never could really tell 
                      why I enjoyed it so much.
 Willow 
                      belongs to a race of little people called the Nelwyns, and 
                      is chosen by his community to take a baby to a far-off crossroads 
                      where it can be found by its people, the Daikinis. The baby 
                      was carried to Willow's land on a raft that was swept along 
                      by river waters. What Willow does not know is that the baby 
                      was placed on the raft by a midwife, who had promised to 
                      save the baby as the wish of her desperate, imprisoned mother. 
                      This was to save it from the decree of death dealt out to 
                      the child born with a special birthmark, which proved the 
                      child to be the successor to Bavmorda, an evil queen who 
                      is not about to give up her crown.
 Willow 
                      (Warwick Davis) sets off with the baby in arms, and at the 
                      crossroads he meets Madmartigan (Val Kilmer), a warrior 
                      who has been imprisoned in a cage. Madmartigan convinces 
                      Willow to free him, and then Willow gives the baby, named 
                      Elora Dannon, to Madmartigan, confident that he will care 
                      for it. When he sets off for home, he encounters a tiny, 
                      little race of ignoramuses called the brownies. These little 
                      people are lead by a sorceress named Cherlindrea, who appears 
                      in spirit form. She tells Willow of Elora's true power, 
                      and that unless he helps her defeat the evil Queen Bavmorda, 
                      Willow's entire village (as well as everyone that lived) 
                      would be under her spell forever.
 Willow 
                      accepts the task of taking the child to the only sorceress 
                      that can counterattack Bavmorda's magic: Fin Raziel, who 
                      lives on a deserted island, and has been turned into a rat. 
                      Since in rodent form, she cannot use her given magic, so 
                      Willow must master her magic wand and turn her back to her 
                      human form. In the attempts to, Raziel goes through several 
                      different transformations, all caused by Willow's improper 
                      magic. In fact, she doesn't actually become human until 
                      they are outside of Bavmorda's castle, and the people around 
                      Willow are being turned into pigs by Bavmorda's magic. I 
                      guess you can say that Willow's fear of Bavmorda's magic 
                      made him nervous enough to get the magic right.
 For 
                      the benefit of those who haven't seen the film, I won't 
                      reveal the end of the plot. You'll have to watch the film 
                      itself.
 The 
                      casting of ""Willow"" has been done outstandingly: every actor 
                      greatly fits their character. Most notably, Val Kilmer as 
                      the daredevil Madmartigan and his obsessive love interest, 
                      Sorsha, played by Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Val's real-life 
                      wife.
 Sorsha 
                      is obviously not a woman you would want to meet in a dark 
                      alley: she's simply a mean little bitch, and Madmartigan 
                      seems to be the only one who could get through her wicked 
                      mind and make her see that she's a victim of her mother's 
                      anger. In one notable sequence, Madmartigan is accidentally 
                      sprayed with a love-dust by two members of the tiny browny 
                      race. When they escape their imprisonment from Sorsha, he 
                      enters her tent, and, due to the love dust, claims his undying 
                      love for her. Thinking he is crazy (which he was), Sorsha 
                      takes a dagger and places it against his neck, confident 
                      that he will stay back. He doesn't. No matter what she does, 
                      he forces his love on her, claiming that she is his ""starlit 
                      sky."" She becomes putty in his hands, and turns against 
                      her mother, the evil queen Bavmorda. She confesses her love 
                      for him later on in the movie, when he's fighting a viscous 
                      two-headed dragon.
 This 
                      relationship was so curiously fun to watch, because it reminded 
                      me of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew,"" when Petruchio 
                      proved to be the only one who could tame Kate. Instead, 
                      it was Madmartigan taming Sorsha, and this provided some 
                      of the most memorable moments in the film.
 As 
                      shocking as it sounds, it's usually violence that provokes 
                      nostalgia movies for me. Maybe movies that frighten us are 
                      those that become reminiscent in our deepest paralell minds, 
                      and ""Willow"" is one of the most perfect examples of this 
                      rule.
 Sure, 
                      the violence was a bit childish, but who cares when you 
                      enjoy it so much? If it wasn't the violence, maybe it was 
                      the evil presence I felt from Bavmorda. I'm not sure what 
                      it was, but when I am drawn into a movie like this, it has 
                      to be somewhere along those lines.
 One 
                      thing ""Willow"" doesn't burden itself with is a use of too 
                      much action and not enough storyline. We commonly find that 
                      in most movies with a sword and sorcery setting, fairies 
                      and dragons flying around seem more common than hearing 
                      decent dialogue or a fair premise. With the exception of 
                      ""Ladyhawke,"" I believe the entire genre has used these traits, 
                      and perhaps that is why I really don't like it that much. 
                      ""Willow"" is nothing like this, though. It's an ambitious, 
                      powerful entry into the genre, unlike any other entry of 
                      it. Perhaps that's what makes ""Willow"" stand out, because 
                      it's simply one of the only original films of the fantasy 
                      setting.
 Yet, 
                      I don't know how I liked this movie so much. I felt maybe 
                      it was because of the sorcery setting, and then I felt it 
                      was the violence. Then the art direction, and eventually, 
                      the characters themselves. Whatever it was, or is, ""Willow"" 
                      is overwhelmingly powerful. I am drawn immensely into the 
                      film every time I see it, and I really don't know why. Perhaps 
                      it will be better for me never to decide why I liked it 
                      so much. Who cares? I still enjoy it, even if I can't pinpoint 
                      the reasons.

                      who has been imprisoned in a cage. Madmartigan convinces 
                      Willow to free him, and then Willow gives the baby, named 
                      Elora Dannon, to Madmartigan, confident that he will care 
                      for it. When he sets off for home, he encounters a tiny, 
                      little race of ignoramuses called the brownies. These little 
                      people are lead by a sorceress named Cherlindrea, who appears 
                      in spirit form. She tells Willow of Elora's true power, 
                      and that unless he helps her defeat the evil Queen Bavmorda, 
                      Willow's entire village (as well as everyone that lived) 
                      would be under her spell forever.
 Willow 
                      accepts the task of taking the child to the only sorceress 
                      that can counterattack Bavmorda's magic: Fin Raziel, who 
                      lives on a deserted island, and has been turned into a rat. 
                      Since in rodent form, she cannot use her given magic, so 
                      Willow must master her magic wand and turn her back to her 
                      human form. In the attempts to, Raziel goes through several 
                      different transformations, all caused by Willow's improper 
                      magic. In fact, she doesn't actually become human until 
                      they are outside of Bavmorda's castle, and the people around 
                      Willow are being turned into pigs by Bavmorda's magic. I 
                      guess you can say that Willow's fear of Bavmorda's magic 
                      made him nervous enough to get the magic right.
 For 
                      the benefit of those who haven't seen the film, I won't 
                      reveal the end of the plot. You'll have to watch the film 
                      itself.
 The 
                      casting of ""Willow"" has been done outstandingly: every actor 
                      greatly fits their character. Most notably, Val Kilmer as 
                      the daredevil Madmartigan and his obsessive love interest, 
                      Sorsha, played by Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Val's real-life 
                      wife.
 Sorsha 
                      is obviously not a woman you would want to meet in a dark 
                      alley: she's simply a mean little bitch, and Madmartigan 
                      seems to be the only one who could get through her wicked 
                      mind and make her see that she's a victim of her mother's 
                      anger. In one notable sequence, Madmartigan is accidentally 
                      sprayed with a love-dust by two members of the tiny browny 
                      race. When they escape their imprisonment from Sorsha, he 
                      enters her tent, and, due to the love dust, claims his undying 
                      love for her. Thinking he is crazy (which he was), Sorsha 
                      takes a dagger and places it against his neck, confident 
                      that he will stay back. He doesn't. No matter what she does, 
                      he forces his love on her, claiming that she is his ""starlit 
                      sky."" She becomes putty in his hands, and turns against 
                      her mother, the evil queen Bavmorda. She confesses her love 
                      for him later on in the movie, when he's fighting a viscous 
                      two-headed dragon.
 This 
                      relationship was so curiously fun to watch, because it reminded 
                      me of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew,"" when Petruchio 
                      proved to be the only one who could tame Kate. Instead, 
                      it was Madmartigan taming Sorsha, and this provided some 
                      of the most memorable moments in the film.
 As 
                      shocking as it sounds, it's usually violence that provokes 
                      nostalgia movies for me. Maybe movies that frighten us are 
                      those that become reminiscent in our deepest paralell minds, 
                      and ""Willow"" is one of the most perfect examples of this 
                      rule.
 Sure, 
                      the violence was a bit childish, but who cares when you 
                      enjoy it so much? If it wasn't the violence, maybe it was 
                      the evil presence I felt from Bavmorda. I'm not sure what 
                      it was, but when I am drawn into a movie like this, it has 
                      to be somewhere along those lines.
 One 
                      thing ""Willow"" doesn't burden itself with is a use of too 
                      much action and not enough storyline. We commonly find that 
                      in most movies with a sword and sorcery setting, fairies 
                      and dragons flying around seem more common than hearing 
                      decent dialogue or a fair premise. With the exception of 
                      ""Ladyhawke,"" I believe the entire genre has used these traits, 
                      and perhaps that is why I really don't like it that much. 
                      ""Willow"" is nothing like this, though. It's an ambitious, 
                      powerful entry into the genre, unlike any other entry of 
                      it. Perhaps that's what makes ""Willow"" stand out, because 
                      it's simply one of the only original films of the fantasy 
                      setting.
 Yet, 
                      I don't know how I liked this movie so much. I felt maybe 
                      it was because of the sorcery setting, and then I felt it 
                      was the violence. Then the art direction, and eventually, 
                      the characters themselves. Whatever it was, or is, ""Willow"" 
                      is overwhelmingly powerful. I am drawn immensely into the 
                      film every time I see it, and I really don't know why. Perhaps 
                      it will be better for me never to decide why I liked it 
                      so much. Who cares? I still enjoy it, even if I can't pinpoint 
                      the reasons.

                      the violence was a bit childish, but who cares when you 
                      enjoy it so much? If it wasn't the violence, maybe it was 
                      the evil presence I felt from Bavmorda. I'm not sure what 
                      it was, but when I am drawn into a movie like this, it has 
                      to be somewhere along those lines.
 One 
                      thing ""Willow"" doesn't burden itself with is a use of too 
                      much action and not enough storyline. We commonly find that 
                      in most movies with a sword and sorcery setting, fairies 
                      and dragons flying around seem more common than hearing 
                      decent dialogue or a fair premise. With the exception of 
                      ""Ladyhawke,"" I believe the entire genre has used these traits, 
                      and perhaps that is why I really don't like it that much. 
                      ""Willow"" is nothing like this, though. It's an ambitious, 
                      powerful entry into the genre, unlike any other entry of 
                      it. Perhaps that's what makes ""Willow"" stand out, because 
                      it's simply one of the only original films of the fantasy 
                      setting.
 Yet, 
                      I don't know how I liked this movie so much. I felt maybe 
                      it was because of the sorcery setting, and then I felt it 
                      was the violence. Then the art direction, and eventually, 
                      the characters themselves. Whatever it was, or is, ""Willow"" 
                      is overwhelmingly powerful. I am drawn immensely into the 
                      film every time I see it, and I really don't know why. Perhaps 
                      it will be better for me never to decide why I liked it 
                      so much. Who cares? I still enjoy it, even if I can't pinpoint 
                      the reasons.

                    if the above review contains any spelling or grammar mistakes.  For 
                      the benefit of those who haven't seen the film, I won't 
                      reveal the end of the plot. You'll have to watch the film 
                      itself.
 The 
                      casting of ""Willow"" has been done outstandingly: every actor 
                      greatly fits their character. Most notably, Val Kilmer as 
                      the daredevil Madmartigan and his obsessive love interest, 
                      Sorsha, played by Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, Val's real-life 
                      wife.
 Sorsha 
                      is obviously not a woman you would want to meet in a dark 
                      alley: she's simply a mean little bitch, and Madmartigan 
                      seems to be the only one who could get through her wicked 
                      mind and make her see that she's a victim of her mother's 
                      anger. In one notable sequence, Madmartigan is accidentally 
                      sprayed with a love-dust by two members of the tiny browny 
                      race. When they escape their imprisonment from Sorsha, he 
                      enters her tent, and, due to the love dust, claims his undying 
                      love for her. Thinking he is crazy (which he was), Sorsha 
                      takes a dagger and places it against his neck, confident 
                      that he will stay back. He doesn't. No matter what she does, 
                      he forces his love on her, claiming that she is his ""starlit 
                      sky."" She becomes putty in his hands, and turns against 
                      her mother, the evil queen Bavmorda. She confesses her love 
                      for him later on in the movie, when he's fighting a viscous 
                      two-headed dragon.
 This 
                      relationship was so curiously fun to watch, because it reminded 
                      me of Shakespeare's ""The Taming Of The Shrew,"" when Petruchio 
                      proved to be the only one who could tame Kate. Instead, 
                      it was Madmartigan taming Sorsha, and this provided some 
                      of the most memorable moments in the film.
 As 
                      shocking as it sounds, it's usually violence that provokes 
                      nostalgia movies for me. Maybe movies that frighten us are 
                      those that become reminiscent in our deepest paralell minds, 
                      and ""Willow"" is one of the most perfect examples of this 
                      rule.
 Sure, 
                      the violence was a bit childish, but who cares when you

                      it was, but when I am drawn into a movie like this, it has 
                      to be somewhere along those lines.
 One 
                      thing ""Willow"" doesn't burden itself with is a use of too 
                      much action and not enough storyline. We commonly find that 
                      in most movies with a sword and sorcery setting, fairies 
                      and dragons flying around seem more common than hearing 
                      decent dialogue or a fair premise. With the exception of 
                      ""Ladyhawke,"" I believe the entire genre has used these traits, 
                      and perhaps that is why I really don't like it that much. 
                      ""Willow"" is nothing like this, though. It's an ambitious, 
                      powerful entry into the genre, unlike any other entry of 
                      it. Perhaps that's what makes ""Willow"" stand out, because 
                      it's simply one of the only original films of the fantasy 
                      setting.
 Yet, 
                      I don't know how I liked this movie so much. I felt maybe 
                      it was because of the sorcery setting, and then I felt it 
                      was the violence. Then the art direction, and eventually, 
                      the characters themselves. Whatever it was, or is, ""Willow"" 
                      is overwhelmingly powerful. I am drawn immensely into the 
                      film every time I see it, and I really don't know why. Perhaps 
                      it will be better for me never to decide why I liked it 
                      so much. Who cares? I still enjoy it, even if I can't pinpoint 
                      the reasons.

                      shocking as it sounds, it's usually violence that provokes 
                      nostalgia movies for me. Maybe movies that frighten us are 
                      those that become reminiscent in our deepest paralell minds, 
                      and ""Willow"" is one of the most perfect examples of this 
                      rule.
 Sure, 
                      the violence was a bit childish, but who cares when you 
                      enjoy it so much? If it wasn't the violence, maybe it was 
                      the evil presence I felt from Bavmorda. I'm not sure what
